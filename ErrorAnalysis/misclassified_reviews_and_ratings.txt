Review: Outdated hotel. No coffee machine in the room. Not enough plugins. Wifi was good. Beds are too soft for me. Casino is boring. Staff will not interact with you. Roulette is electronic. The food was not great.

Review: To start they treated like an intruder; They had me waiting for an hour for checked items and while waiting I got harassed for no reason by their male bravado bloated security guard. They sent me off to a very distant room from the lobby without assistance with my belongings-  Only to find I carried my stuff across this big hotel to THE WRONG ROOM.    The toilet did not flush    It was impossible to get any assistance about where to dine - the help is of the culture of a fast food restaurant.    Then when i wanted to depart it was impossible to get assistance with my bags I had to wait at the front desk once again and get the manager to instruct a bellman to get belongings to my car.    Then upon departure they tried to charge me foe parking twice.    VERY RUDE OBNOXIOUS PLACE! disorganized too!    Stay anywhere else!!

Review: Took my daughter for her 21st hotel was beautiful and clean. The room was cleaned and restocked daily. There is no coffee pot or useable fridge in room but it is easy to find places to eat. Located near the majority of attractions. Highly recommend!

Review: We stayed here for a week on honeymoon after spending 3 nights in New York first.    The room was amazing all the rooms are suites. Large comfy bed huge bathroom 3 tv's living area with sofa and table and chairs.    The pool area was clean and nice even though the water was absolutely freezing.    The disappointment for us was the sheer cost of every little thing. I ordered 2 drinks by the pool these cost $60.  A small bottle of non branded water from the room was $8.    There were no coffee making facilities in the room and this is something i expect. So each day we went to the casino to get coffee which cost $10 every visit.    The gondala ride inside the hotel was a cost of $137 for like 15 minutes.    I visited Las Vegas in 1994 and 2000 and back then the whole town was good value free entertainment and all you can eat buffets etc.  I will never visit  Las Vegas again its put me off all the shops were designer brands we took plenty of money to enjoy ourselves we really felt like we were being ripped off everywhere and resented handing over our Dollars.

Review: Paid $1900 for 3 nights at The Venetian. With “prestige” upgrade which was a bunch of nothing.    House keepers flipped our bed sheets lol! Didn’t even bother to give us new ones.. I know because the other side had the Buffalo sauce from their $30 Buffalo wings and 75min wait room service.    $104 on room service.. we got 2 appetizers and 2 sodas.    Free breakfast with our “prestige” upgrade.. that had Apple sausage.. wt* is Apple sausage. No eggs. Bacon. Nothing.    All this money.. you guys need to invest in some air purifiers in your rooms. The rooms air was so thick! & My nose was stuffed every time I went anywhere near the Venetian. My nose automatically knew when I was leaving out of the grand canal shoppes.    If anyone believes this is a 5 star hotel. They could have never went to Miami or any island. This was bare minimum.

Review: Nice hotel but horrible resort fees. Hotel has nice amenities but you will pay out of your butt for them. Even if you do not use any of them the hotel still stick you with that unethical resort fee. I won't recommend you not to stay at the Venetian because it is nice but be ready to be fleeced with that fee. By the way don't bother trying to dispute it with the Attorney General in Nevada that office won't even return your calls.

Review: The staff are amazing and very fast to provide service! So the reason it isn’t 5 stars ⭐️ is not because of them… it is because there is no available fridge in the room and no coffee maker. So if you are diabetic and need to travel with insulin buy a travel fridge because if you even BUMP something in the fridge or on the concessions counter in the room it charges your account. No they can’t remove the items so you can actually use the fridge because there are sensors built in that even if they did when you put your items in there and take them out it would still charge the room.

Review: We loved our stay at the Venetian. Suites are spacious and quiet decor is fairly timeless. Sue did a fantastic job helping my husband prepare a lovely surprise - roses champagne and truffles were a real touch of class. Two downsides: Check-in attendant did not love his job and it showed (I've had friendlier service at my post office. A 'hello welcome how was your trip?' goes a long way). Secondly what's up with no coffee makers in the room? We ventured downstairs for coffee but in the morning we just enjoy a cup without having to interact with 3rd parties. Come on Venetian if my car mechanic shop can offer a coffeemaker with pods you can too! Especially with that $50/day resort fee right?

Review: As a frequent traveler I was extremely disappointed. The smoking guests have ruined this beautiful building. The smell permeates the lobby and Casino. The hotel does not provide surgical masks and all guests must walk through smoke to access guests rooms

Review: No coffee making facilities in the room.  No cleaning on one day and was told this was "normal" as a lot of people were checking out. Had to wait on phone for a long time to get the staff to even provide fresh towels that day.  Huge waits for check-in and check-out & trying to contact any member of staff by phone or in person. Overall a really disappointing experience especially when they charge so much for a nightly stay.

Review: We have stayed at the Venetian 5 times in the last few years and are very satisfied with their facilities luxury clean and nice. Guest rooms are all suites some with two king/queen beds big rooms. I usually get up at 6 am and went out for exercise and coffee; with the huge room size I managed not to wake my wife up who usually sleeps until 9 am.  As with other resorts on the strip it’s always a long walk from where you park your car to your guest room 10 minutes for us.

Review: Room was nice towels were thick but NOT soft very rough. No coffee maker in room so you had to either wait 30+ minutes for room service and pay too much or dress and wait in LONG line in lobby for Starbucks. Neither option appealed. Can’t believe that coffee in your room was too much to provide. Mini fridge was useless since they had it filled with their products you could not use it for your own anything you touched in the fridge got automatically charged to your room. Hotel was conveniently located on the strip.

Review: My family and I stayed here for almost a week and we did not like it for several reasons. The overall service experience was not good we had the feeling the everybody treated us with no dedication or enthusiasm or desire to help and be nice. The Front Desk person at arrival was exactly like that I went to ask her what to do with the check in and key pick up and her answer was: I have not finished you have to wait until I call you. No smile. To be honest our worst experience was the room itself. I don’t know if it is because of the carpet or the old curtains all over the room but it was full of dust; we could smell it since we got in. Very bad if you are a person allergic to dust. Old rooms. The room service is mediocre at best very limited we tried one day to have in room breakfast but they did not have small yogurt for my daughter. It was only available at the grand lux cafe for breakfast. I though that for a hotel with so many stars and fame they would try to go the extra mile for their guests. Another thing is how dark everything is especially the restaurants I don’t understand the reason behind it. The canal shoppes are nice but most of the time very crowded you can’t walk without bumping into people not like the one at Caesar palace that is more wide and with more space to walk. The gondola rides are very nice. One night I called room service and asked for two extra pillows and the lady told me that I could have only one because it is limited really??? In a hotel with so many stars??? We always ask for more pillows and this is the first time a hotel give us that answer. Regarding the casino area the area was always with a heavy smoking smell I know it could be common because people smokes there but in other hotels we went in the smell in the casinos was not that intense. Finally during the last two days of our stay there was also a convention and that made the hotel more crowded. One night we had to walk and walk back and forth to find a restaurant that was not reserved for an event or had availability for their own hotel guests. That night we were able to have dinner at Buddy’s V. The overall hotel experience was very bad for us. During our stay we visited almost all the hotels in the area and I liked Caesar palace the most. Next time we will stay there. My advice is Do Not Stay here. Old dusty rooms poor illumination poor service and crowded. Find another hotel.

Review: My daughter went for the Mr. Olympia festivities in December. I have been to Vegas many times and stayed at the Bellagio Caesars Wynn Mirage and many others during my jaunts to Las Vegas. I had previously stayed at the Venetian not long after it was built and I have to say things have gone downhill. We stayed in the Venezia tower in Room 12-622 and it seems that a lot of these rooms in this area seem to be for tours as the furniture needs replacing in the rooms and the carpets in the hallways either need to be replaced or cleaned.    The room was a nice size with 2 large beds and a sitting area. But the headboards are filthy and the couch cushions are almost non-existent and the glass on top of the tables needs to be lifted and cleaned and the underneath of the 4 chairs in the room all of the black matting underneath is frayed and hanging loose.    The best thing I can say about the hotel is the great central location.    There is a mini bar in the room but if you touch or move anything you are charged instantly whether you meant to take it or not. There is no space in the mini bar to put personal stuff in there like medication and the hotel will charge you an extra $40 US per day to put the mini bar in your room. Also anytime we tried to get in touch with someone whether it be concierge bell hop room service operator or front desk it took a minimum of and no word of a lie at least 20 minutes for someone to answer the phone call. The front desk staff and the security people are rude rude rude as well as not friendly or helpful and need to go to Customer Service School if there is such a thing.    The best person there is the gentleman who was at the small desk as soon as you come into the hotel and I wish I would have gotten his name as he was lovely but he was shorter and an older gentleman. As well there was a woman who was on the same desk but at night on the day we arrived on December 13th and we were trying to get Uber Eats delivered to the hotel and the guy from Uber Eats said they would not let him into the hotel so I went downstairs in my housecoat and spoke to this night person and she she just stay right here and I will go to try and find him and she did. THANK YOU TO BOTH OF THESE INDIVIDUALS.    Lastly the Venetian Customer Service will not help you with anything as they say they are a full service hotel and do not want any food or drinks coming into the hotel from outside as they want you to either get ripped off from Room Service or go to the restaurants in the hotel which again are crazy expensive. One thing I did do since we tried to get a microwave sent to our room and they said no way but my daughter needed it for her meal preparations since she is a bodybuilder and is on prep I went to Target and purchased a microwave for the room brought it back to the room in my suitcase so I did not get questioned and when we left I returned it to Target. So for anyone looking for a microwave this is the only way to get it. We should have thought about that with the Mini Bar Fridge. LOL    NEVER AGAIN THE VENETIAN AS THERE ARE WAY BETTER HOTELS ON THE STRIP THAN YOURS.

Review: Would have been 5 stars had it not been for our experience when trying to make a second reservation.    Stayed here on 12/29 in a 1 bedroom 2 queen suite. We loved our room and we loved the Venetian. Saw security take care of a few issues with people who were not guests very quickly and room cards not just had to be shown (looking at you Caesars) but actually scanned in order to access the elevator banks. Casinos were well thought out not very smoky and spacious. Room wasn't ready upon arrival after check in time but it was ready about an hour after we arrived. Easy to leave bags with bell services. Resort fee was lower than some other resorts and included parking and wifi.    Cons - Lots of restaurants but no significant variety. Would love to just have a basic spot for a sit down breakfast. Youngest is celiac and requires a gluten free diet and the options were available but more limited than I'd expect in a city the size of LV.    Biggest con and reason I didn't give this resort 5 stars - despite what it says in the tripadvisor resort description about 100% not losing reservations they 100% lost our second reservation. Our trip involved 1 night in LV 2 nights in Phoenix and then our last night (1/1) was supposed to be near the Grand Canyon but significant snow pushed us back to LV (flight was in/out of LV). Made a reservation for a Premium 2 Queen room for 1 night the morning of Dec. 31. Received a confirmation screen confirmation number etc. but did not receive a confirmation email. Card not charged. Emailed the reservations email at 2:30 pm (had made reservation at 10:30 am) no response. We were at the Fiesta Bowl and called after the game around 6 pm. Agent 'D' first blew me off by saying oh well we don't have any record of this this is a known issue with our system you'll have to make another reservation. I pushed because I had a confirmation number AND since this was a known issue. She supposedly went and talked with her supervisor who supposedly told her that I'd have a confirmation email by the next morning (morning of our arrival 1/1).    I highly doubted this but I wasn't too concerned as there were other options in LV.    Morning comes. Of course it was an empty promise.    Called back. Got a much better rep who quickly forwarded me over to a supervisor. Rep again let me know that this was a known issue. Supervisor first made me feel like it was my fault - said it was probably a credit card number being entered incorrectly wasn't concerned about what I'd been told the night before told me that my email just landed in an inbox full of 1200 emails that he was going to have to dig through to find. I told him I still had all the specifics including the generated confirmation number. He said he'd research it. Took about an hour for him to call back but he said that yes the known issue produced a confirmation number but it was because by the time I hit submit for the reservation that room type was no longer available. I was an oversold reservation but the system still created a confirmation. At that point he said there was nothing he could do other than offer a low floor standard 2 queen suite. That just wasn't going to work for us so we declined.    We weren't looking for a comp. and you know they've got rooms held back for high rollers. I just wanted the opportunity to pay for something comparable to what I had reserved. When it's a KNOWN ISSUE they really should fix the situation or be prepared to make things right. I recognize that as I'm not a high roller that I'm not any kind of priority but it's just bad business.

Review: We almost always stay at the Venetian when we are in Vegas and this visit was great until the end. We were charged $27 for three small bottles of hotel water! The hotel water is next to Fiji water and universally that means the hotel water is complementary. Not at the nickel-and-dime Venetian! Nor are there any signs advising of the charge. Without even a coffee-maker in the room literally nothing is complementary. Bush-league.

Review: We always love to stay at this hotel mainly because the parking garage comes right up where the rooms are and it's FREE! It is the best. But this trip the slot machines were so tight that it wasn't any fun. On top of that I don't know how many times we had to ask for the cocktail person. Two nights in a row we got one drink and then that was it. We kept asking and pressing the service light to have them send the person back but no avail. We don't mind gambling and losing as long as we get a couple of bonuses and have fun and we get something to drink. This trip that didn't happen. We definitely will have to reconsider before we booked this hotel again.

Review: My family and I stayed here recently and although the rooms were OK they were not the easiest to get to from the casino there were lots of hidden fees - IE a resort fee for every person every day for the stay which was NOT mentioned in booking and we never used the "resort" features of the hotel snacks that are on a motion sensor so you're afraid to even bump the dresser less you get charged for them (they should be included as part of the "resort" fee anyhow!) and just a meh view. I was really disappointed overall. Next time in Vegas I'll stay somewhere else.

Review: I cannot thank one of the front desk managers Brenner for helping me pull off a great surprise which led to a fantastic weekend! It was my Mom's 60th birthday and she had no idea I'd be surprising her. After calling the front desk the morning of her checking in Brenner went out of his way to make sure the surprise went flawlessly. Thank you so much my man - you gave us memories of a lifetime!

Review: They gave us a 9th floor room that had a strong odor of smoke. When we asked for a different room they tried to make us feel like we were being difficult and that the room was a non smoking room. We later found out that the entire 9th floor was a smoking floor for years. We eventually got a nice odor free room on the 8th floor but the process took over an hour and totally killed the excitement of arriving for our first stay in Vegas. Thumbs down.

Review: I requested a high floor for special occasion. They acknowledged. Their rooms start at level 4. I was put on floor 8 in a ‘city view’ suite. It was directly across from their pool which was under construction. Literal jack hammering cement at 0730. Which mean most hot tubs were not working. And no view right into a wall. We visited the Bellagio to make it a point not to spend money at the Venetian since a very simple request was completely ignored and it looked so much better.    I’ve never splurged or stayed at a 5 star hotel but I honestly don’t understand at all how they are able to make it ignoring very simple requests like mine and give me such a crappy experience just awful.

Review: Check in was poor. Cleanliness was unexceptional . Grand lux Cafe the filet was not edible I'm not rndc convinced that it was a filet it was under cooked as in raw and was chewy. We waited over an hour to check in because they were cleaning our room. When we got to our room finally there was a cleaning sponge on the floor in the bathroom and the floor had not been vacuumed. There was food in the floor. It was an all around poor experience
