50,We just got back with our friends three couples six total. Had three rooms at Aria. One king room and two suites. Rooms were big beautiful  clean and comfortable. Suites were amazing but we were in the king and wonderful for us. Bathroom was huge very clean and gorgeous. All new. Hotel is huge! Quite the walk just to get to our room on the 22nd floor. Casino is big and fabulous. Not too many people winning around us anyway. Lobby is beautiful and was decorated in all Chinese new year themes. Was not given any upgrade for 25 th anniversary celebration. Location is great. Close to cvs pharmacy if you need anything which we visited several times. Free monorail tram from park mgm to Aria to Bellagio and back. Shopping mall attached but all high end shops. Helps with transportation! Lots of great restaurants in the hotel it’s self. We lived Jean steakhouse for anniversary dinner second floor and Taiwanese restaurant in casino for lunch. Food court on second floor for breakfast. Find the hidden speakeasy. It was a blast! Be prepared to walk!!! Also Vegas is now very expensive everywhere! We very much enjoyed our stay and trip!
50,Our first stay at Aria (after many years at Mirage which is leaving MGM) was absolutely wonderful. Comfortable clean room with a great view excellent food and bar options (loved especially Javier's and Din Tai Fung) friendly and helpful staff and fun gambling options (video poker and slots). We came with several family members and everyone had a great time. (highlights for them were the pool and poker room) We will return for sure.
50,We stayed Feb 2023. We had an enjoyable stay! It was clean and updated. This is only our second time to stay at ARIA. We had a view of the strip. We usually stay at the Wynn or the Venetian. This is that level for MGM. It is the best choice. We have done most of the higher end MGM (Bellagio MGM sky lofts etc.). We will come back to this one for sure. We had an issue with our bed reading light not turning off. A wonderful maintenance man came to assist us. We didn't use housekeeping. The room service was great. The beds and bedding was very comfortable. The rooms are pretty large. The casino is very inviting. We have nothing but good things to say about this hotel. Great job to all!!!
50,Any time we stay at the Aria we have an amazing time!! The staff is always so friendly and accommodating. I really love a place that has excellent service!! My favorite place to stay on the Vegas strip.
50,Enjoyed my stay at the Aria. Feels very fancy. Like the amenities the bed and the casino. I wish the casino would go smoke free however. Everyone was friendly during my stay. Liked the positioning on the Strip. Will stay again.
40,The hotel foyer was incredible. It was decorated for the lunar new year with the Water Rabbit and traditional Chinese dragon. The man who checked us in was polite and professional. We didn't use the concierge or bell boy services but they were offered and very friendly.    The room was clean (the cleaner was just closing up as we arrived) and in a good standard. There were a few minor defects; one of the glass lamp shades was chipped and cracked along with some dust and hairs on the furniture (although this was in hard to see places). The windows were also dirty on the outside but clean inside. That said the beds were comfortable the room spacious the water was warm and all toiletries seemed to a good standard. The room was only serviced twice during our 5 day stay but that's because we were in the room when they wanted to come in (around 4-5pm when we came back to change and rest after a day exploring before going out so awkward timing).    The rest of the hotel was a great experience in the day. Plenty of shops amenities and places to get food or drink (2 Starbucks). In the evening the Casino was really noisy because of the Alibi nightclub although Park MGM is only a short walk - smoke free and much more relaxed.    At check out I was shocked to see a $600 charge for the minibar. I had put some water bottles in there and didn't see the sign that there was a charge to do so. The minibar itself didn't close and so the water wasn't even warm. I explained this at reception and the charge was waived without any issues.    Overall a good experience a bit more attention to the cleanliness of the rooms and more helpful servicing times would have made the stay perfect. I would stay here again but be prepared to use a different casino in the evening due to the noise of the nightclub.
50,We had a really fun time at the resort. Club Jewel was fantastic. Table service was fantastic and well worth it . The rooms was clean the bed was comfortable I would love it. Highly recommend it. Thank you so much.
50,This was our first time staying at Aira and I think we have found a new favorite hotel/casino in Las Vegas. The entire staff was very friendly and our room was gorgeous. Well-appointed clean updated and well-maintained. We look forward to our next visit.
20,Not the best experience.  The automatic curtains in our room didn't work. The faucet on the tub was corroded. We didn't want anyone in our room after we unpacked but I'm sure they would have moved us. Also the parking lot is really really far from your hotel room. AND you have to walk through the (sometimes) smokey casino to get to the elevators. If you are young and can walk it's fine. But if you are even a little out of shape you are not going to like this walk.  The biggest problem was in the parking lot. There is a big bump at the end of the pay lane that many cars have hit. After we damaged our rental car the hotel couldn't have cared less. We went to the front desk and the gentleman admitted it is a known problem. After we damaged our rental car we saw a big pick up also hit it. See photos attached!  I saw the same parking set up at the LUXOR and they did not have a big bump at the end of their set up. The ARIA needs to do something about this to save future accidents. And though we've sent them emails and called no one responded.  I will give them credit for this: On the day we checked out we told them about the curtains and faucet and they deleted our hotel extra fees. That was generous.  But no- it's back to the Bellagio for us.
50,When researching Las Vegas hotels for our first trip I knew that I wanted something that was on the strip and in a fairly central location to the casinos that we were interested in visiting. After looking at previous reviews on some other hotels we went with Aria and I am glad that we did!    The check in process with Trinity was super easy. She took the time to answer all of our questions that we had and had such a wonderful attitude the entire time! She even gave us extra water bottles for the room!    The resort is absolutely beautiful and not hard to find your way around. The elevators to the hotel are located inside the casino itself but signs are everywhere so it's easy to navigate where you are heading to.    We stayed in a Strip View Room on the 15th floor. It was a super quiet room with a great view when everything was lit up at night. We kept our privacy light on during our stay but we always saw house keeping out on the floors if we were to need anything.    Overall it was a great hotel! We don't have any complaints and would definitely stay there again.
50,"We came here with our kids for some time to look around as well as to eat dinner at Din Tai Fung. This is a very pretty casino and hotel with modern glass and metal design. It is technically ""on the strip"" but it is built back enough that you don't feel like you are right up on the street. It has kind of an ""urban island"" feeling to it. We checked out the conference center rooms while waiting for dinner and they were very pretty but also seemed comfortable. I will say that the place did not feel all that family friendly overall more like it was built for couples or groups of couples. I really liked the place and I look forward to coming back on a ""date weekend"". In the meantime it is a beautiful place to gamble eat and take in a show."
50,Holy crap you better be ready for the SMELL! They waft the Aria scent in HEAVILY - I like it I just don't like it immediately invading my nostrils and brain when I walk in. Other than that though GORGEOUS casino and hotel. The casino has my favorite roulette game so that's great. Tables seem to be lively regularly. The food selection is top notch - overall pricey but delicious.  I feel like Aria is really great at seasonal decor - Christmas and Lunar New Year are always decadent and so impressive. The rooms are nice very modern with updated furnishings and gadgets. We stayed at the hotel for free through the MyVegas app rewards so it was definitely worth it! We would love to go back again!

50,I stayed at the Aria when it first opened and just spent another 3 days there last week. It’s still a top notch hotel and is well taken care of. Staff was very friendly and helpful. The room had a beautiful view with floor to ceiling windows and it wasn’t beat up like other hotel rooms. Only complaint is the the restaurant choices and there are plenty are all very expensive.
