50,Stayed here for the half marathon weekend.. everything went well from the location to the start line. Plenty of food options around. Check-in and checkout was fast and simple. Overall decor of the casino was a good experience.
50,Everything from the Vip Lounge Service Housekeeping Engineer Service Limo Drivers to the Casino/Hotel Front Desk Representatives were truly Outstanding! The Suite was clean the temperature was great and the beds and other furniture were comfortable. We loved all the plump pillows as well. When we called about an issue with the television volume it was fixed within the hour. Check in was a breeze and I checked out utilizing the television without any issues and dropped out room keys into the drop box in the elevator lobby. Location for us was not an issue as we used the tram for other strip locations and called an Uber and spent a day downtown. I really had nothing to complain about.
30,We stayed at the Luxor based on childhood memories of my favorite hotel of our family Vegas trips. Not much has changed since the early 2000's and many of the rooms are in need of upgrades and repair. I was honestly disappointed with the state of the rooms especially given the prices.    Location on the Strip is great with walkways to Mandalay Bay and a tram between Excalibur Luxor and Mandalay Bay made for convenient walking.    Customer service was great Location is so convenient.  However the rooms are outdated and not worth the price.
40,We booked the Luxor as it was a bit more affordable than other places we have stayed previously on the strip and I wasn't actually expecting that much. I was pleasantly surprised at the comfort of the room easy self-parking and convenience to Mandalay Bay which had some restaurants we wanted to eat at during our stay.
10,Housekeeping cleaned my room despite my request not to. They took ALL the soap & I had to call 4x to get soap. I nearly missed attending an expensive show because of their incompetence. And then they did it the next day too. The tub tap leaked continuously and had hard water build-up caked all over the faucet. Environmentally irresponsible.    I didn’t need an alarm clock. I woke up at the crack of dawn when they started blowing debris off of the turf outside.    Had a couple rude & inconvenient experiences at the Registration desk too.    Considering the weekend nights were over $500 you might as well stay somewhere nicer cleaner and with competent staff.
50,While not the most luxurious property on the strip the Luxor was very nice for the cost of the room it was also close to my conference hotel. New upgrades were evident in the rooms (wallpaper and dresser) and the bed linens were thick and plush. There are never enough Starbucks anywhere during the morning conference rush but that was the only downside.
10,I reserved a elite suite in June 2022 and I was told there were no elite suites available. They gave me an extra $150 for the problem but I didn’t care about the money. They should have the room you reserved that you reserved 7 months before you arrived and there was no communication from the resort before I arrived.
10,Dirty rooms poor service. No hot water for showers. Ripped sheets. Earring left on nightstand from previous guest. Parts of the hotel/casino smell like sewer and the ceilings were leaking. Very cheap place.
50,Luxor hotel was an amazing experience first time staying there but will definitely stay there again on my next trip! I will definitely let friends and family know to stay there as well when going out to Vegas !
40,The location is a bit far from the action of the strip. Some of the rooms a very outdated. But if your stay in the towers if feels like a completely different hotel. I will only stay in the towers. The rooms are way more updated. They might be a little smaller but it’s worth it.
30,It was ok at best the room was clean and checking in was all right the parking was a nightmare and the room service lady walked in our room was out knocking and caught me and my wife making love so that was an issue
50,I don't understand the bad reviews at all! The hotel is a little dated but the rooms were nice and staff at the hotel and the casino were awesome. Food options were great gambling was fun. I would stay here for the money anytime. The outdoor area around the parking lot was a little trashed but that is because we rented a car and self parked.
10,The only thing positive was the nostalgia of early 2000s.  I was charged $446 when I was supposed to be charged $343. I tried to checkin using app and it didn’t work so I waited in line for 30min. Horrible experience only then to be overcharged.
40,First time experience and Luxor. Clean courteous and friendly staff easy to navigate with space enough to not make you feel like cattle. Buffet Breakfast offered lots of choices and was clean and constantly presentable. Thank you
30,People movers were down between properties water was cold for showers and the pipes were loud all night we thought the neighbors were having good squeaky fun all night. We're passed on by site staff for MGM Rewards items to go to another property.
40,The rooms were nice. Bathrooms were clean and updated. The restaurant selection inside was decent and the location was perfect. The hallways were a little gross and sometimes smelled and our hot water was not great. It wasn’t cold but my lukewarm shower was not my favorite. But that was really the only bad thing I could think of. I would absolutely stay here again.
30,Room cleanliness could use some work behind the tub u could tell where people laid there head and was stained or not clean. A/C would not get very cool no matter how low we set it. Other than that it was decent for the price.
50,I received a complimentary night at the Luxor so I took advantage and stayed. The room was clean the sports book had plenty of available seating and the ice machine was close to my room. MGM doesn't disappoint with their hotels.
30,There was a rain storm that leaked into our rooms. I had booked 3 rooms and 2 of the 3 rooms had water leaks from the rain. One even dampen clothing from the leak. I had called to notify them of the leak and they said they would be sending someone to take a look but no one came. When I checked out they said they had no record of the call and had just only taken off the resort fees for two of the 3 rooms for one night. I'm not really satisfied with the resolution and the service received. I didn't feel valued.
50,Had a pleasant stay at Luxor great customer service clean room and excellent location.  I do recommend this hotel this is my third stay and iI have had any issues.  A minor observation live music a little too loud this last stay. I was on the 14th floor room 133
20,Our room began to leak into our suite case while we were out so when we arrived back we found all of our belongings every last piece of clothing was soaking wet the hotel switched us rooms which was a GIVEN and 100% expected the (bare minimum) ! And only provided 75$ as credit for bar and food I would have loved for them to even buy us a clean shirt and shorts or even clean underwear to wear to bed or to wear after we showered that night but no ( we tried to use the credit for clothes but we’re told we could not) instead we had to bag all of our soaking wet clothes in plastic mgm bags that were provided by their bell service and slept in our clothes from the day with hair smelling like casino smoke and cigarettes… as you can imagine I was extremely upset then we were charged an over weight fee of 69.00 at the airport because of the soaking wet clothes !! We were not over weight when we arrived but we sure took 4 pounds of soaking wet clothes back home just a horrible experience worst birthday trip experience keep in mind I showed the hotel front desk staff the video of our suite case full of water and got a yeah whatever reaction so I’m sure this happens often .. if your wondering what the building next to the pyramid is  it’s where they send all the unhappy guest after there rooms has begun to leak !! Such a crappy experience..
10,not happy at all the parking was 40 dollars a day and all the restaurants closed at 3 pm the tables to gamble were 20 dollars or more per hand would like more options...nothing really to do at this hotel will not return
30,Stayed three nights for a Stay and Play youth soccer tournament. Seemed like an odd choice but anyhow. I would say staying at the Luxor was a classic case of you get what you paid for. We had a room in the pyramid. It was dated no frills (I never knew renting a mini fridge was a thing) the windows leaked when it rained but on the plus side the beds were comfy and the shower had probably the best water pressure of any hotel I have ever stayed at. 😆    The food was not bad either restaurants or food court options though certainly came with that Vegas premium price. All the staff we interacted with were friendly and helpful. The hotel is certainly in need of some maintenance and some updating.    If given the choice I would not stay here again but for the price it served its purpose. It’s location is a bit of a hassle if you want to access the main strip but there is the tram to get you near New York New York and then monorail access at the MGM Grand.
50,Came out with family for a birthday celebration had a great time at luxor great experience fun times on the casino floor and winnings! Will definitely be back here and staying at this resort again for our next trip
50,Quick staycae with my wife while I work on the strip. Room had easy access to uber pick up. Room was clean and spacious and I love the separate tub & shower. Nice to unwind in the jetted tub after standing for 10 hours. Returning this week
40,Paid extra for stay well but could still smell cigarettes despite being on 26th floor and my skin got so dry.  It got REALLY windy and it shook the windows. Couldnt' sleep that whole night. But the other nights were good.
20,The room was okay - lacked a microwave or fridge but we dealt with that. All was okay until we returned from a day out (it had started raining out) we came to our room with parts of ceiling falling in and a steady stream of water dripping that soaked the floor chair and personal items. After being hung up on our first call to the front desk- the next person was more polite but we were offered a bucket and added towels. “Many of our rooms are leaking right now” so - as long as you don’t visit when it rains you may be okay! Poor response to a very wet and inconvenient situation.
30,Hotel was OK. We stayed in the pyramid and the room was quite a walk from the lone bank of elevators no option for stairs. The housekeepers didn't clean the room unless you were gone by 0900 in the morning. We stopped the maid and asked her to clean the room after 4 nights and she still didn't come. Price was right but that's about it.
30,Luxor is a mediocre property on the strip located less centrally so you'll have to walk a bit to the other resorts. The staff was friendly but the rooms were dark and smelled bad. Also limited food options and casino machines. Wouldn't recommend unless you're ok with the bare bones experience
40,This was my first time in Vegas and my first time in the Luxor Hotel. It was a very nice experience. The place was very nice and clean. The pillow and bed were very comfortable. There was no issues with noise and I was able to sleep very comfortably. I really enjoyed my stay and added an additonal night. I will definetely come back.
40,We had 4 nights comped at the Luxor and after reading all the not so great reviews we weren't expecting much. Firstly the elevators in the pyramid are fine. We were on the 27th floor in a Stay Well Queen room. It was clean and tidy and bright-just as the photos showed. The bathroom was big with loads of counter top space and towels. Really impressed and wouldn't hesitate to stay in one of their Stay Well rooms again.
40,This room had great water pressure. It was a decent room over all. I had trouble with my digital key not working in the elevators because I lost wifi signal when entering the elevator hallway. I had to stand in line a few time for keys. Two of the three front desk staff I interacted with were a bit crabby. Overall the stay was decent.
30,Mobile check in is super convenient but still get key cards as the digital key doesn't always work for the elevator or the room.  Shower door handle was broken. Bathroom exhaust fan wasn't working. Counterrtop below TV was sticky and had crumbs on it.
20,A truck backed below are room at 5:30 am was there for 2 hours  Doing something with a loud pump running drinks and food to expensive had room service food was cold by the time we received it will not stay again
40,Staff and experience was very nice! Friendly and helpful during our entire stay. I felt very comfortable and safe. The staff was professional friendly and most of all they seem to remember guest are there to have fun. They had a since of humor which made our group’s experience more enjoyable.
30,We came in Oct. 2022 and then in Feb. 2023 to celebrate our Annivesary our Birthdays and my wife's retirement. This was my wife's 9th trip and my 4th to Vegas we have stayed at the Luxor the 4 times I have come with my wife her and her sister and their girlfriends have stayed at other hotels as well.
10,Carpet coming off the floor. They charge random prices for shows. Way to expensive for a dirty room and they do not care if you're with a wedding party you won't be in the same area nor can you get to other rooms
50,I always have a great time at the Luxor from the tower suites to The Public House. I am not a big fan of the pyramid rooms but don’t normally have a problem getting a tower suite. Keep up the great work I hate hearing rumors of the demise of the Luxor..
30,Stayed here for a volleyball tournament as it was right next door of where the tournament was. I did not think the walk was bad at all and actually never had to go outside where it was a little cold. The rooms do need to be updated. We stayed in the pyramid part. Room rate was great but where they get you is the resort fees/per day.
40,Luxor is a nice Hotel. Friendly Staff. Prime location on the strip. They have some things they need to work on like better room service hours and game variety. Public House is an awesome place to eat. Recommend you give Luxor at try and give them feedback on your experience to get their entertainment level to superb.
10,The got me with $25 a night. Then when you check in there are resort fees of $35 per night resort taxes of $15 per night then parking $18 a night. I asked what are my parking options; either $18 for self parking or $35 for vallet. So basically scammed me there too. They took out the mini fridge and left a sign saying you can pay to rent one…. Room barely had hot water. I was still cold while taking a shower. Super uncomfortable. Went to go get a pizza slice. Ended up paying about $35 for some reheated nasty pizza. Overall feel scammed.
10,Rooms did not have enough amenities. The customer service was poor during check in. Customer service overall was lacking. I struggled to find someone to provide assistance or direction when needed. I will not be staying here again.
20,Luxor was a good casino. In my room I found blood on the sheets. The location is close to the end of the strip and was food for walking around. If you use self park be mindful of the tunnel and stairs into the casino at night.
50,Luxor is my favorite place to stay. The rooms are clean and comfortable. Suites are very large and luxurious. Fine dining at Tenders is always tastey and exceptional. Backstage Deli is the best I have ever been at. Love Pyramid cafe for breakfast and Pubic House for late night drinks and snacks. Just really enjoy this resort and casino
40,We had a very nice time at the Luxor. The rooms were clean and comfortable the view was nice. There are many restaurants and stores to choose fromthe buffet has an excellent selection with a many different options . There is a bus stop right out front.
40,My son and I stayed here and it was a very nice hotel. Great lobby and right on the Las Vegas Strip. The staff was friendly and we enjoyed a number of the restaurants in the hotel. The rooms were very nice but a little outdated.
30,We were here for a conference that was held in Mandalay Bay. Being able to park once and just walk made it worth it. The rate we got through the conf.($58/night) was GREAT but I would not stay here at regular price. Rooms were dated- no usb charging ports- so bring your wall charger. Beds were mediocre but the shower was AMAZING!!!!!!!! Where our room was situated- The speakers for the PA music was so loud it was like being next door to bad neighbors blaring their music. No separate hotel vs casino area due to the hotel design. I know others that have stayed here so maybe we just were unlucky with our room. (Don't stay in #3009 or nearby lol).
50,Stayed at Luxor for 2nd time..learning to get around..found indoor walkway to Excalibur + Mandalay Bay..Also rode the Tram between hotels but wasn't running when windy..lots of signage to find your way around Casino..fun slot machines..free drinks good ..had fun..  What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas.
10,Would never recommend this hotel. Felt dirty it’s a structural mess with windows that allow wind to howl in. The staff was friendly but that doesn’t make up for the room quality. The elevators rarely worked and if they did you had to wonder if they were even safe.
30,This was my third time staying at Luxor hotel. Although the overall experience was very good the quality of the room that I stayed in was not as good as previous times. The staff was very pleasant and professional. The premises were very clean and were very picturesque. However the room I was staying in. Did not have a dresser for my clothes.
40,Hotel has everything in one location. But the pyramid cafe restaurant customer service was aweful. Loved view of the mountain front 17th floor east tower. Housekeeping was quick to resolve any issues with cleanliness of room. Beware of people in lobby giving free vouchers you have to listen to a session about another MGM property.
40,Suite was nice and clean. Bathroom was huge. Casino has great games. Buffet was a good value. Food Court is expensive compared to others. Back Stage Deli was fast and opened late. The Public House was very good.Service was very good. Food portions are big.
40,Great property location gaming floor dining options etc and clean. The biggest problem was housekeeping (or lack thereof). Too many hotels are still using COVID as an excuse to cut back on housekeeping or make it opt-in. In our four night stay we had housekeeping services ONCE when we called to complain on day 3. On day 4 we asked them to come again at 5:30 after going out for the night. They never did.
50,Good food I was able to order late night & it was very fast service. Hotel is close to everything shops food we tried the ice bar & it was awesome. The staff was very nice & the drinks were great. Will definitely stay here again
30,The hotel itself is beautiful. There are lots of entertainment options on site. My room is what left a bad taste in my mouth from this experience. My room was not clean. Used items were left in the room from the previous guest. Per day parking is an additional fee on top of the resort fee. This was not diclosed previouse to my checking in.
30,Although the staff was great the rooms need attention. The rooms are outdated and worn. There are not any USB chargers in the room. Diablos is worth the stop. It was so good we ate there twice. This was my 10th trip to Vegas. The food and staff is fantastic even better than the Hilton Resorts World. But I paid for an upgrade to a queen corner suite. Save your money.
40,The hotel is nice the rooms were very clean the bed was wonderful.  The TV did not carry many popular stations. The Buffet closed at 3:00. I can't imagine why The Tender Steakhouse either closed early or was not open for the majority of my stay. Very disappointing.
40,"We stayed here 3 nights in the pyramid - the King Suite with a tub by the window looking directly at Mandalay Bay. I always wanted to stay in the pyramid so we finally did! The ""inclinators"" were slow but nothing more than 5 minutes from the 19th floor. It was a slow time though so I can see how they would get super busy. Unfortunately our room 19001 was directly across from our floor's elevator so we had a dang trek every time we wanted to go somewhere or put something back in the room ""real quick"". That's my main complaint - had we been on a lower floor or closer to the elevator - it might not be terrible. Our AC went out for one night that sucked we didn't get offered a discount or anything either. But they fixed it the next day and the rest of the stay was fine. We used the food court a couple times ate at Diablo's and a few visits ago we saw Carrot Top which was actually really enjoyable! Overall I don't think we'll be back to stay here."
10,Stayed here because of a sports convention. Front desk personnel were rude and unwelcoming Room was dirty restroom was not clean bed was very uncomfortable and sunken in the middle elevators were old and inside was falling apart. For what I paid should’ve at least been a 4 1/2 to 5 star hotel. Very disappointed!
20,Hotel is nice. But the room was dirty. The shower would flood and the lights would flicker. The bed was also dirty with hairs and it was old so it wasn’t the best sleep. I was also offered an upgrade beforehand but the room wasn’t ready. So I got the regular room. But they had a problem taking off the upgrade fee. So I was over charged for my stay. They kept saying they would fix it but I haven’t seen that happen yet. Pretty disappointing
10,Please I am begging you to train your call center people not to lie about there not being a security deposit on a comped room i should not have to come out of no money to pay for my free dang on room is not fair
20,So disappointed! I had high hopes for this budget hotel. Expectations were met only for room cleanliness and location. That’s it. Is currently only in the 40’s in Vegas and the AC unit is only spitting out cold air despite me setting it to the max 80. Contacted guest services last night who said they’d send someone up. I guess I should’ve asked when because no one came. So I slept in my socks and sweats. Then looked forward to a nice hot shower but nope. At the hottest seeing the best I got was a smidge under lukewarm so not devastatingly cold but not in any way comfortable (and zero steam I love my steamy showers). The hallways are dingy dirty. I used mobile checkin so that was easy and decent.  But I can’t deal with uncomfortable room temps and cold showers (and a maintenance staff so limited no one can get to my room in a timely manner) so this is my first and last stay at Luxor.
50,I have stayed here almost every year except for the Covid era. This year the staff was exceptional the room very clean and maid service each day and all at a fair price over President's day weekend.
50,Staying at the Luxor was an awesome experience I always enjoy the rooms the views where to look very good quick to get to the Uber and ride share area. I had good luck in the casino area this time actually left with more money on my gambling budget than when I started! I got to enjoy the Luxor Buffet which I hadn't gotten to try before so I was very excited about that and it was great with great choices and drink options!
50,My son loves nostalgic themed Vegas and the Luxor is our favorite place to stay. The staff was excellent and the room great. Luxor may not be the newest but it’s our second home and always will be.    We were upgraded to a higher floor room in the pyramid as my son loves the architecture and nostalgia. The front desk staff were very hospitable at any requests we had and made the trip special. The room was great and seemed recently remodeled. Awesome strip view and within walking distance to all the shows we wanted to see.    Can’t wait to visit again as he’s already making plans for us to go back.
10,I stayed as I received discount as part of a conference. I had read reports that the Luxor is possibly going to be demolished. It does feel this way as we noticed a lot of signs of disrepair and no maintenance. You are better to spend your money elsewhere.
50,The lecture hotel and casino is always a great experience they got great food great staff very friendly lots of things to do lots of things to see staff was very friendly housekeeping was great it's always a pleasure to work with Kyle and Frank
50,Great room - room suite was more than we needed - enjoyed the quiet - staff really great - very clean - pyramid cafe great for breakfast- husband and I shared the breakfast classic - large portions - enjoy
20,The overall experience was not pleasant from the cold hotel bad smoke and lack of air circulation. to the high price for cold not good food. Paying $19. at Johnny Rocket for a cheeseburger and fries is crazy. They were cold and when I complained they wouldn't do anything.
40,I was a bit apprehensive after looking up reviews a day before flying in. However I didn’t experience any of the negatives in previous reviews. My room for the most part was clean however slightly dated which I expected. The location was very easy to get over to Mandalay Bay Restaurants during the day there’s numerous options. However the layout is a bit weird. At night the food selection is one restaurant but the food was very good. It’s very close to Mandalay Bay which offers more premier dining options. For my trip the slot machines payed better than a previous trip to mandalay bay. The elevator works but is very slow at times. The only real problem I had was the app for mobile check-in stopped working and I had to go to the front desk to get a key card. Every staff member I worked with was very friendly helpful and it seems like a very positive work environment.
10,The hotel is dark musty and dated. Reminds me of a run down Reno dive. Elevators are slow and can be far from your room. Prepare for a lot of walking. For whatever reason the Pyramid hotel has almost no Egyptian decor it's all been removed. There really is no unifying theme it's like they just didn't bother. The larger restaurants close at 2 so there are lines to eat mediocre overpriced food. The exception was the Public House which was very good. The room itself was fine pretty standard but since they all face the open inside of the pyramid the sound from the casino can get loud.
40,Hotel was very nice for the price. Very spacious great view and also had a very nice bathroom with a large bathtub. Very affordable place to stay for what is included when not booking room at peak time.
30,Very poor experience with mobile check in. Wasted my 5 hours. My guest kept waiting outside. I had to call three times to fix a little problem. Why Offer mobile check in if this can not be honored. My app showed checked in and said.. you will receive an email/message with digital key. It never came in until I called with my frustration.
20,Our room was dirty and broken. There was rotting food in our mini fridge stained bed sheets no working ceiling fans smelled of smoke broken dresser everything was just old smelly dirty and broken. I will not stay here again unless the property is updated and it becomes less expensive.
40,I liked the room. Bathroom was nice with a good shower and tub. Beds were too firm for me but pillows were comfortable. The air conditioner could’ve been better. Maids cleaned very well! Would stay again
30,I had heard mixed reviews about the Luxor. I was pleasantly surprised at how well the rooms had been upgraded. There are like most things some imperfections (the walk from the elevators to my room was more of a hike) and the elevators themselves could stand to be renovated. All things considered it was an affordable place to stay for the conference we were attending.
40,No a bad stay the hotel is a little older but the did remodel the rooms so it not bad and the cost is ok . They do a good job of trying to stay current. its close to the actives that we needed and that all that mattered to us.
30,Room was clean but no frills and dimly lit bathroom. Hallways very noisy. Mattress and pillows uncomfortable. We paid extra for check-in at 11 but were not allowed in the room until after 12. Price was reasonable.
30,A hard bed and no in room amenities what so ever. Get ready to spend five dollars for a banana or $10 for a bottle of water. And there are literally no options of food for someone who does not eat meat.
10,Customer service was poor. They downgraded our rooms and only deducted the resort fee. Our rooms were booked six months prior. We will not be returning to the Luxor. We were tending for a convention and vacation.
50,A very memorable experience for me and my husband for our first trip to. Vegas! We truly enjoyed every moment the only thing we wished we had was a microwave as food was kinda spendy we were able to reheat any of our left overs.
20,This I have to admit was the worse trip to Vegas. Hotel was horrible! If we wanted a refrigerator in our room we had to rent one! On top of that it was $40/day to park our car at the hotel!!! When we stayed at the Stratosphere parking was free and we had a refrigerator microwave and coffee maker in our room. Not at the Luxor!!! Only booked there because I could walk to Mandalay Bay for the conference and supposedly the rooms were discounted which I don't think they were.
40,Decent place to stay if you are attending a conference at Mandalay Bay. If you drive they charge for parking even if staying at the hotel. Recommend getting a key card instead of using mobile app the app wouldn’t load most of the time.
10,The hotel feels very dated and dirty. The standard of the rooms are below what I would expect and definitely below the standard of the neighboring Delano and Mandalay Bay. There was no coffee maker in the room and there was no accessible room service to the pyramid portion of the hotel. The curtains had to be kept closed as the sun heated the room beyond the capability of the AC. There were exposed wires and broken buttons in the elevators.
20,The person who did my reception to check in did not give me good service and gave me a room that was dirty and the water was not working I went back to the reception and they changed my room and that one was clean and the water was working
40,The price and value for this hotel is great. It's at the south end of the strip so you have to walk a little bit to get to a lot of other attractions. But overall it's a good bargain. The rooms aren't anything spectacular. They don't come with a fridge or microwave. Only major issue I had was the price of the food court is kind of high for the quality of the food. The building is a little smoky too. But we had a great time regardless. Just be prepared to walk to the nearest monorail stop.
50,Great price per rooms. Our rooms have always been very clean. Great walking distance to a lot of great activities. Great food options within the lobby or very close by. Parking is very reasonable and with plenty of parking.
40,There is easy access to the Excaliber Mandalay Bay and New York New York. The rooms in the east tower are very nice. Avoid rooms in main building too dark for me just felt old and kind of dingy. Excellent customer service.
30,Our room had no mini fridge no microwave and no clock. It's nice but very basic. I don't even think the WiFi is free because it wasn't advertised like most other hotels are. The tram to Excalibur and Mandalay Bay is nice. My room key didn't work when exiting the parking structure the the 4 days I was there despite telling the person at the front desk twice and getting new room keys. We stayed here only bc my daughter had a volleyball tournament and we had to stay with the team. It's close to the Convention Center which is convenient. The elevator travels sideways and it gave me vertigo every time.  t
20,Entire hotel reeked of pot. The guests in the wrong next to us smoked pot the 3 nights they were there. Front Desk and Security did nothing to stop them. If you want to get a contact high at a rundown dirty hotel this is the one for you.
20,The room will not get cold or stay cold (stayed in both the tower and the pyramid same problem) towels are more like exfoliating loofas than towels no refrigerator microwave or coffee pot (but you’ll pay a hefty resort fee) phone in room doesn’t work so you can’t call housekeeping (phone is part of why they charge resort fee) wifi is terrible. The charge their guest for parking. Bed are ok definitely not meant for a long stay.
40,Outside of resort fees and other fees  nice accommodations and staff availability great .Just no reason for fees when staying off season Nov thru March and very little ability to use any of the amenities the fees are being charged for
40,Luxor is a beautiful building with beautiful rooms. Elevator was a bit confusing but once figured out it was a nice security feature. Had a few things happen but nothing I would complain about. I would return to visit again. Not an avid traveler so not bad after recovering from covid lulls.
50,Easy check in clean and tidy room. Staff was friendly and courteous. Lobby area was neat. Elevator was quick and not overcrowded. Bathroom water pressure was terrific and my girlfriend especially liked that the room had a bathtub. Would definitely book again
10,Rooms are super old and bathrooms are what you would expect from a hourly rate hotel. Shower and shower pressure not satisfactory at all. Even the Americas Got Talent sign on the side of the Luxor is torn up and faded.
20,This property needs renovation. Old carpet walls need painting rooms need updating. No refrigerator in room. Elevators extremely rickety and painfully slow. Casino was blah and boring. The only good thing was that shower had great pressure.
50,I arrived very late to the hotel. I was able to check in using the app and gave me access to the key immediately. I went straight to my room without falling in line. Using the app to check in/ check out and use digital key was great quick very convenient avoided long lines and the wait time. Through the app I was able to get a summary of my stay and expenses as well. Looking forward to using it again during my next stay.
40,Stay was overall great. The issues I had were minor: low tissue and toilet paper at arrival. Toilet flush/water flow is not good - poor toilet design. No USB outlets. No refrigerator. Dined at Tender Steak and the hostess was not attentive or friendly - it was as if we were bothering their conversation. Service at the Tender and pyramid cafe was slow (initially - after being seated too a long time to get drink orders and bread).
10,This 29 year old hotel shows in every corner from top to bottom. If you're looking a basic place than perhaps this is it but between wonky elevators and strange rooms this is not the place for my family. Staff is nice enough and their pillows were comfortable but between the parking shower shutting off and outlets not working it is not worth trouble when there are so many other properties to select in Vegas. We unfortunately were mandated to stay here for a team sporting event. I will never stay here again.
40,Went for the volleyball tournament held at Mandalay Bay. We like the fact the Luxor is close enough to walk! Looking forward to seeing what the renovations are going to be in their pool area. Wish there was a refrigerator in the room.
30,Great price. Have to pay for parking. Worn furniture. No room service really. Walkway to Mandalay interesting. Nice view. TV poor quality. Cable selection limited. Interesting atrium. Nice showerhead and water pressure.
30,No frig microwave or correct amount of sundries per person in room. 1 garbage can and slow housekeeping response. Mobile checkin didn't work for 10 in our different groups. They rake in so much dough they should do better. We were in the pyramid. Elevators slow and not all seemed to be working.
10,Our room stunk of mildew. There was a giant garbage can in the middle of the room to catch water and another outside the door with water flowing in it constantly. Staff are helpless because the problems are overwhelming. Staying here will ruin your trip to Vegas.
20,The Luxor looks like it would be fun but it's really just a basic hotel that lacks even standard amenities like a fridge or microwave. The restaurants are limited and overpriced. There are limited elevators compounded by the fact that one of them was stuck on the 6th floor for the duration of our visit (5 days). Public restrooms were in bad shape. For example the men's room in the food court area had only one urinal (out of 3) that was in service. Only one faucet was functional. The air hand dryers were broken and there were no paper towels. I guess the Luxor doesn't really want you to use their restrooms and they definitely don't want you washing your hands afterwards.    Hotel staff was generally friendly but I am really disappointed. I guess this is the new version of Vegas which is probably why they're struggling.
50,This was my second stay at the Luxor. The first time I stayed in the Tower this time in the Pyramid. This experience was a lot more fun. The rooms are closer to the casino floor restaurants and exhibitions. The rooms were comfortable and some of the cleanest rooms that I have stayed in. Definitely a great place to stay!
50,From start to finish I had a great experience. The rooms were very clean. The staff was very friendly. The beds were comfortable. I have stayed at the Luxor every time I go to Vegas and it hasn’t disappointed me yet!!
50,"The staff is exceptional the rooms are super clean and the spa is great! The price and location are a great bonus. The only ""problem"" we always have is how long the elevators take. Other than that everything was amazing as always."
30,For the price of our room and the quality of the room the price was a little high. The keycards are also a hassle. We had multiple friends and family members staying in all sorts of rooms in all corners of the hotel. It was a pain to coordinate with them to go to their rooms. The bed could also be a little more comfortable
40,It was a good value located on the strip and close to all the venues. It was very decent for the price. The Luxor has many restaurants and bars very good ones at that. We enjoyed the super bowl party at the Public House and it was excellent food drinks and good times.
20,1) In our room the bathroom sink wouldn’t drain properly. 2) It seems like self park is too far and penalizing to families who need a vehicle for various reasons. 3) the mobile app kept room key worked intermittently in elevators.
40,My husband and I came for our 20th anniversary. We were pleased with allowing early check in and detailed directions to our room. Our room was very quiet and clean. Only down side was being further down the strip. We had an amazing time!
50,The theme of our stay at the Luxor was sort of wild free spirited this beautiful hotel is conveniently located near the Las Vegas strip and has fabulous artistic environment that welcomed a diverse crowd of people; we loved our family stay at the Luxor so much that we plan to be there again! Thank you!
40,The Luxor is a fine hotel and resort. The staff are professional and friendly the building and grounds are well maintained and the casino offers many options and games.  The Luxor is on the far southern end of the Strip which makes visiting attractions more of a challenge due to the distance. There is a tram to Excalibur and Mandalay Bay but we felt it was less distance to use the walkway instead.  We did not get to use the pools at Luxor as we visited out of season the pool available to use (at Mandalay Bay) was excellent.
20,If you like the waiting after you check in time even with early check in this is your place and not receiving notifications when it is ready and having to carry your belongings around because they didn’t even offer you to check them it is great
30,Hotel right at end of strip so walk or bus to the main strip the hotel was big felt pressured to upgrade our room as we arrived early and they said our room not available. Pressured into going to a timeshare place they wouldn't leave us along until we said we would go. Room basic and no tea-coffee making facilities and the bathroom need a lot of TLC. We loved Vegas and will go back but stay in one of the other hotels.
10,I was in town for a tournament with my daughter. We had requested an early check in and late check out for an extra $30 and $20. At check in the man/employee at the front was rude because he didn't see the request. He then left for 10 minutes and I was just left standing there wondering what was going on. After he comes back I tell him not to worry about it and he got mad at me because he said he took the time to go look for a room as if I was supposed to know that and that he was doing me the favor. He was just rude.    The room was dusty and crumby. I didn't want to complain since I had already had a terrible experience at check in. Never Again!! Better to pay the full price than save.    The housekeeper however was so nice
10,Luxor double booked our room so they down graded us. Fine it sucks but at least we still had a room. Would have been nice if they could have at least given us clean room. Pee on the toilet seat dirty carpet obviously hadn't been properly cleaned. Tried to get ahold of the front desk and never reached anyone just kept getting put back on hold. Won't stay here again.
20,Room was not very clean. No fridge closet and the air didn’t seem to work well. It was a place to sleep but that’s it. I would not pick there to stay as my first choice. The people at the front asking to give you show vouchers was not my favorite thing every single time you walk through the lobby.
10,I was disgusted since I approached the check in desk with her for almost 45 minutes we’re told she’s gonna see if they have a room for us and all the rest of the terrible things followed afterwards from the smelly rooms. There is sheets if you go on forever.
40,Hotel was clean and beds comfortable. The only downside was there isn't a refrigerator microwave or coffee pot in the room. All the staff were friendly. I would definitely stay there again for the price.
40,Nice relaxing time hanging out with friends having a good meal mostly relaxing and enjoying these off work having a few drinks at night not having to worry about getting up early the next day being able to catch up with friends
50,Kind friendly staff quite rooms clean room had no issues only thing we didn’t care for was the parking that you have to pay for why pay for for parking when your paying for the room already other than that no issues
40,I had a blast in Las Vegas and the hotel was a great stay great price overall staff was good friendly except when you got to the tables to gamble a lot of the managers on tables that were in charge what kind of I'm welcoming and acted better than everybody they can definitely use some friendliness advice and have to welcome guests overall pretty good stay.
40,The staff were friendly there are great amenities and easy access to other casinos. The building needs some updates especially the hotel rooms. I was expecting something a little different based on the photos I saw when making my reservation especially in the bathroom. The rooms have no fridge or microwave which can be helpful when staying for an extended amount of time like we did. Overall I would recommend and would probably stay here again.
10,The heat barely worked it was always cold in the room and we had to mess with the heat a lot to try to get it to warm up the other heater didn't work it was blowing out air the hot tub was not cleaned when we tried to put water in it a whole bunch of black stuff was coming out of the drain check-in was horrible cards were not working but when we use them elsewhere in the hotel they work just fine we kept calling our car company and they kept telling us it was something wrong with Luxor our room was not ready when we got there it took about 4 hours to get in the room they kept on telling us that maybe we didn't have money on our car we had $10000 on it so that wasn't true. It was my birthday I had appointments I couldn't go in the room and take a shower I had people waiting for a birthday dinner we had stuff to do it was such an inconvenience and at the very end they offered to take a deposit when they could have done that 4 hours ago so I could at least get in the room and shower we came down and paid immediately after my husband's flight got in. Yeah I'm not leaving food we have to keep coming up and down the elevator walking through the casino to get a food delivery that's also an inconvenience a couple of times I came back to my room my door was open we had to keep on constantly checking if anything was missing there was definitely a do not disturb sign on the door nothing was cleaned so it's like who the F was opening my door. the room was much smaller than it looked like in the picture. There was also never any indication upon booking that there was construction or anything a lot of people were complaining about that on the elevator. And I do have pictures to prove all of this stuff. Can barely get the front desk to answer the phone during certain times this place cost way too much money bunch of hidden fees even if you do pay on the MGM website
30,my daughter lost her passport credit cards and other documents she hasn't received enough support from luxxor hotel we hope somebody could help us its a Dominican passport her name is Jennifer Vidal Sanchez my phone number is 809-8504934 we appreciate any help...
50,Our family gathered for our grandson's 21st Birthday. Staff was very helpful with any questions or concerns. Staff at check in was friendly an welcoming. We stayed in the Pryamid so the rooms were dated but comfortable and clean.
10,Horrible room. Less quality than a Motel 6. For over $350 we had a room that smelled of smoke no deadbolt on door section of carpet missing in front of HVAC unit TV did not work (cable was not connected on back) bath vent was pulled loose from wall trash can in bathroom was rusty outlet cover missing from wall near TV furniture was scratched and worn.    For the price paid you would also expect glasses and not plastic cups a coffee maker minibar and refrigerator and hopefully a real closet and not just a bar in the room to hang clothes on.    In addition in order to save time we checked in via the mobile app and obtained a digital room key. It did not work in any elevator so I went to the front desk to get a physical key. The line was 50+ people long. I went to the concierge desk and was advised to use the mobile check-in desk to obtain a physical key. However it requires a QR Code which I had not received. So only other option was to stand in line with all other people checking in. Not a great start to a vacation.
10,The hotel tried to charge my card 4 times in less than 3 hours for charges that were not mine but the person u had my room before me! Even after figuring the issue out they still tried to charge my card! The manager pretty much told me not to worry the charges aren’t going through ( luckily i moved my money around) He also said the hotel will figure it out in some days and then they will stop trying to charge you
10,I can’t recommend staying at the property. They sold out our room and offered us small compensation and after going back and forth to the back a few times (about 30 min in total) we just gave in as we checked in late. Then our room was not clean as the surfaces were sticky and everything was dusty. Hallway floors (we were in the west tower) had stains all 4 days and there was puke in the elevator for most of one day. The restaurants and shows were great but check in and general service were very poor.
50,We originally had a room on the first floor. The grandkids did not like it it was to far from the front area. I asked for a different room and they gave us a room in the 1st tower 27th floor. A super great experience for the kids. They loved it!
40,I needed a cheap-ish hotel because of the price I paid for my Adele ticket and this one was great! It’s in a good location and has a lot to offer. It’s at the end of the strip and is connected to Mandalay Bay & the Excalibur by a tram and walkways. The buffet isn’t that good but there’s other food options onsite that I didn’t try. Download the mobile app and do the mobile check in it’s so easy! I paid a little extra for early check in and my room was ready for me before I landed. You can also make your own physical room keys once you check in on the app so you don’t have to wait in line to speak with someone.
50,We enjoyed our stay! Ruth and management took excellent care of us at check-in and made our anniversary special!!! Stephanie and all the staff provided excellent service at the Pyramid Cafe! Our room was nice and clean. One of our best stays in Vegas ever (and we've stayed at several high end to mid priced strip hotels)!!!
50,No bad review Stay was awesome 👏 Location was everything located on the strip. Customer service was awesome 🤩 5 stars for sure Family & pet friendly! Uber/lyft friendly very easy to manage and move. Food was awesome as well.
30,Stay was ok. Rooms need refurbished. Store employees were very pushy at some stores. Too many kids running around the hotel and the casino. Thought kids were not allowed in casinos other then to reach the restaurants. If we come back to Vegas we will stay elsewhere.
30,I used to love coming to mgm bc of the mlife program and all of the befits I was platinum and it comes with a bunch of perks this last time I went I realized they dropped me down to sapphire and started me over to 0
40,Second visit great experience staff was very accommodating the rooms were clean and pool was big and clean. Location is on the lower end of the strip which was a good location. Enjoyed the Egyptian theme.
40,I liked staying there. Coffee places were convenient but the check in person I got was nice enough but not inviting. I think he was overworked. The cleaning staff was very nice and I did find the breakfast buffet was very good
40,I really didn’t want to stay in the Luxor after reading so many negative reviews however was pleasantly surprised.    Check in was easy we got upgraded to a tower room which has a lovely view.    Cleaning was variable and the cleaning staff was very rude to us on our last day walking in twice without locking telling us “time to go” even though we had a late checkout and was trying to rest before a late flight.    The resort fee is annoying but pretty standard in vegas. We enjoyed staying at this end of the strip as it’s much quieter and we enjoy walking.    I would suggest in you are a couple you make sure both your names are on the room booking. I had a unpleasant incident being locked out of the room late at night as my key wouldn’t work and as the booking was only in my partners name they wouldn’t replace the key it took two hours of calling for them to wake him up and check it was okay. This is clearly great from a security view but it placed me in a very vulnerable position.    There was not coffee machine in the room which was annoying and the queues to Starbucks was huge at the weekend. We enjoyed walking through to Mandalay the bear in there are fab!    Although we had some grumbles we would certainly stay in the hotel particularly as this is always reasonably priced.
50,Clean rooms friendly staff fun museums and many options to eat inside the hotel. Easy access to other hotels but be prepared to walk long distances. We had lots of fun. The hotel also have a couple of bars with good music.
40,It was an average room a little bit stuff on floor under the table in the room melted ice in ice bucket so I assume it was left there by someone else since we didn’t get to the hotel until after 11:30pm it should have been spotless…and the resort fee when you book through the airline is not included in the price of your room…😳
10,Hotel needs a lot of TLC and a regular graffiti cleaning crew wow. The elevators are an experience kinda like riding in a subway or public transit.  Unfortunately the Luxor has gone down hill over the years and apparently nobody cares. Stay way for now maybe some change will come in the future. There is no way I’m the only person who feels this way..
30,I was at the property for two nights and it was like being in two different properties. The first night I was in the Pyramid. I read the rooms had been updated. I'm not sure that's true. The elevators and halls were worse than the room which was very dated. The biggest problem was my inability to get a cell single in my room.    I moved to the tower the next morning. Much newer more up to date and well-maintained. And my cell phone worked!
40,This property is a little far south on the strip and older but it is very nice for the price l the rooms in the towers are very nice as well. There are areas that need some help but this place is fun
10,Did not receive the view I purchased and requested. Room was dusty and hair from previous guest or housekeeping was all over bathroom. Shower drain was clogged and shower head was covered in soap scum. No refrigerator or microwave. Had to throw out meals I paid good money for. Not even an a small coffee pot. I’ve stayed at basic hotels and gotten better amenities than I did here. They only thing good about this place was the staff was nice. Highly doubt I would recommend or stay here again ever. Also did mobile checkin at the advice of the hotel. Also a waste of time as I still had to go back to the desk and get keys because the card readers in the elevator didn’t work with my digital key.
20,Luxor was enticing for us due to our interest in Egyptian culture. The hotel clearly disappointed both in terms of rooms as well as overall service. Everything is old and feels like a 2 star motel. Staff doesn't work on any requests you make. Really unpleasant experience.
30,Mold in the refrigerator panel on the soaking tub was broke and lying on the ground. Was told I couldn’t get a new room because they were completely booked but would send maintenance up immediately. Maintence never came and the issues were not fixed in my 3 day stay
10,There are much better hotel options in Vegas. Nothing spectacular to experience here. It was said this is the motel 6 of the strip. Rooms are not secure- slots odds are bad- tables are few and crowded- everything is too expensive- add that to paying for parking and no comps- it sucked.
30,Had to use the key to get up the elevator. Only one elevator led to the 21st floor so there was a lot of walking around to get to the room. Everything very expensive but that's Las Vegas for you. Check in wasn't the friendliest- asked about a shuttle for the airport and only answer I got was there isn't one. I liked that the hotels were connected so you can shop throughout a few hotels. Had to figure out the parking at first.
20,Poor service and the employee's we delt with were not helpfull or rude! Housekeeping services took forever! The parking pass didn't let us in or out most of the time. Rooms smelled like mildew. Won't stay there again.
50,Great rewards. Amazing service. The total package. I would definitely stay here again. There was a mix up with my room but the ladies at the VIP counter took care of me gave me a better room and also $150 credit for the inconvenience
20,In desperate need of maintenance and housekeeping services. Took us 3 tries to get an acceptable clean room and almost 3 hours of going back and forth to the front desk.  Baggage handlers were not present when trying to unload in incredibly busy drop off line. Elevators with missing electronics panels and took multiple times to read room cards to get to our level which we seen multiple people have the same issue having to ride up and down until card was read to let off on desired floor. Visible dirt debris spills throughout casino floor and hallways elevators.
30,First time to Vegas and not impressed by what I saw compared to what my friends told me it was like. They stayed at different resorts and had a great time. If I go back I will stay else where. Sad to say but not worth my money I paid
10,Never again will i stay here they don't have cameras in the hall ways if they take some thing from your room they don't have a way to see who toke it and they just don't care they give you a lot of bs
50,Room was very spacious and clean and the self check-in was awesome we avoided the lines and went straight to our room and used our phon for key. We will definitely be back and stay again soon. The cleaning lady we had was very friendly.
50,Booked a room here for Super Bowl weekend for under $100 per night! The room was nice and comfortable. Hotel is in a good location with a tram that takes you to neighboring casinos. Good options if you're looking for a quick bite to eat on property.
20,Manager make me feel like I’m stupid for not using my food credit but the front desk told me I can use it for next time I visit even tho I ask him if there anything I can do if I k ow that I can’t use for my next visit I would’ve use the credit management is not helpful at all at least you do t have to make me feel stupid.
20,I was very disappointed in the Luxor this time on my trip to Vegas. The room was average - stayed in the Tower. We had breakfast at the Pyramud Cafe on our first morning and paid $65 for a mediocre meal at best. The eggs were cold bacon greasy and coffee lukewarm. The service was slow and it was not even busy.    After that we had breakfast at the buffet in the Excelsior and it was much better for the cost.    We wanted to take the bus to Fremont Street and not one of the staff we spoke to knew how to use the transit system. The cost was much less than Uber or taxi and it was very in -expensive way to get around once we figured out where to get on it. We even used it to get to the airport for our return flight.    Overall we had a good holiday but would stay at one of the hotels on the strip not offset like the Luxor.
20,Our stay in the 2 bedroom tower suite was the worst. Outdated Dirty worn out nasty shower head and broken chairs and bar seats made of wicker that had holes cut through them. Very disappointed.. Smoke free it was not. Housekeeping and their masking the smell made it even worse with the chemical that they sprayed THROUGHOUT and all over everything to hide it. So why not wear that smell out as it settled in everything we brought to wear.
30,The room style was very nice. But i felt it wasnt very clean. The carpet was disgusting that i didnt want to walk on it barefoot or even in just socks. The bedding had hairs throughout and i questioned if it was a fresh set of bedding or if the bed was just remade from the previous guest
40,Good place to enjoy but the location is pretty lacking. The food choices are average no upscale dining. The coffee shops are plentiful but you will spend money on taxis to get around. The connection to Mandalay Bay great.
10,Paid $50 for show tickets that I never received and paid $40 in Uber to get to the location of the show tickets to be conned into a $15000 time share! Also the app does not work for check-in my advise: visit the counter for a person instead of waiting hours for nothing.
50,Very friendly staff great service clean room. Casino floor was very roomy lots of slot machines to choose from. Good arrangement of table games. Drink girls are awesome always coming around asking if you want anything.
30,The room while clean had A very springy bed and it was hard it’s an older hotel so it’s not the best beds. The “inclinatior” had some broken panels which made getting up and down the floors of the hotel a bit sketchy.    But the staff was friendly and we had no real complaints
10,Worst experience I have ever had at a hotel especially in Vegas I would never recommend this to anybody not even a stranger or someone I didn’t even like. The customer service is horrible Management is not good either and the rooms were dirty especially during these Covid times I was shocked how dirty this was. Please avoid this place at all cause he will be disappointed if you stay here. The only good thing was our host Leah who helped organize some of the things we wanted to do other than that it was all terrible. The food at the buffet takes like frozen food Lilian an employee there is the worst customer service I’ve ever had Chicken is a long line and definitely do not opt for them to take your luggage because you will not receive it and you will have to make the extra trips back-and-forth to get it.
30,There is a strong smoke smell throughout the property. This was very hard to get away from due to the pyramid design of the building. Fridges are also not provided in the rooms and only available at an extra charge.
40,Always a great stay at the lux need more time here and can’t complain about too much although there are somethings I would change. Also the pools were not open and were in construction this whole trip advertise next time pls
50,The Luxor is the best. Not too fancy not to shabby- just right! The rooms in the Pyramid are our favorite and the entertainment options are great! Check out the Public House for dining. Great food in a Sports Bar motif.
50,Loved our stay and having a mini fridge and a coffee maker in the room! Beds were comfy nice deep bathtub and the staff was exceptionally friendly and helpful. We enjoyed our stay and will be back for sure!
20,Dogs pissing on floors--Smell of weed everywhere--impossible to get assistance unless you go down to the front desk. No one answers the phone--TV kept loosing contact. The stations were all sports. Poor Y-FI
20,Resort fees are unacceptable--especially if the pool is CLOSED. The design of the hotel's rooms are classic but not installing modern amenities to a room is ridiculous. At least include USB for device charging. The refrigerator in the room had food from previous guests. The television offering was extremely poor. Again resort fees pay for what? Drastically expensive for not much.
10,Too expensive for a room that doesn't even have a coffee machine not even a cooler parking is expensive Food Fair food is bad and expensive actually I wouldn't recommend this place at all there are better options for everything which is paid in the Luxor.
20,If you can get a decent rate at Luxor and need to save money it isn't a horrible place to stay. Maybe our tastes are a bit snobby but the only part of the trip we enjoyed was not being on property.    The room wasn't dirty but it felt old and dingy. The AC had a hard time blowing cold air in Feb. Around the property feels either dated or empty as if they're ready to move out. The elevators I'm the pyramid can be in unfortunate positions where you have to go through a maze to get to the main floor.    Mirage was our hotel of choice great people excellent rooms for the price but Luxor just cannot be a replacement. If you can swing a few more dollars try NYNY although I admit we have yet to stay there only play.    If your expectations are low you'll be fine staying here. If your standards are mid/high I would avoid Luxor.
20,Too far from strip. Beds and pillows are not comfortable. Takes forever to get hot water. Some restaurants don’t open until later so if you like to eat dinner before 5:30 you have to go elsewhere. Staff are pleasant
50,Staff was very accommodating I love everything about this casino from the front to the best of the departments thank you luxor I will recommend this casino to every kitty was very nice there was another lady but I forgot her name she checked me in she was also accommodating very nice lady
40,The hotel is little bit dated but overall it was a good experience. The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful during my time there. At this time I wouldnt recommend paying extra for a suite unless it was renovated. It just isnt worth the extra money in my opinion.
40,All in all was a very good stay just Need to be updated I would of loved to have a microwave or mini fridge in room even a coffe maker it is Vegas late nights lots of drinking I need coffee lol my stay was good tho
10,I need someone from the company to make this right for me my room was dirty had old sheets and trash in the closet where I'm supposed to keep my stuff. The hall way and the elevator smelled like there was a really bad sewer pipe leak terrible smell
40,Room was fine sometimes wait fie elevator was a bit long 4 of them but only 1 or 2 working at a time. Casino waz not overly crowed lots of room to play and not feel jammed in . N8ce to be able to walk to the hotels on either side with out going outside.
50,Wonderful stay. Enjoyed several of the hotel’s excellent attractions. Great buffet. Loved the atmosphere of the pyramid. Will definitely stay here again. Easy to pick up Ubers and close to the airport.
50,We enjoyed every minute of our stay in this hotel. Just a little confusion about the check in because we've got to Las Vegas driving and had to self-park before checking in and walk to the check in area. This hotel has great amenities.
50,Luxor Resort and Casino is a stunning oasis (pun intended) of luxury and excitement in the heart of Las Vegas. From the moment you arrive you are greeted with a warm and welcoming atmosphere that is both relaxing and exhilarating at the same time. The attention to detail and level of service provided by the staff is truly exceptional making every guest feel like a VIP.    The rooms at Luxor are spacious and beautifully appointed featuring modern amenities that make you feel right at home. Whether you're looking for a peaceful retreat or a high-energy escape the resort has everything you need to make your stay comfortable and memorable.    Personally we made a short business trip which included my father and my wife. We all love the overall ancient Egyptian theme of the resort making it our primary reason for the stay. Overall the ancient Egyptian theme at Luxor adds a level of excitement and intrigue that is truly unique. It sets the resort apart from other Las Vegas destinations and creates an immersive experience that makes every guest feel like they are part of a fascinating and mysterious world. As you approach the property you are greeted by a massive 30-story pyramid that is reminiscent of the Great Pyramid of Giza complete with a massive Sphinx statue standing guard at the entrance.    Whether you're in Las Vegas for business or pleasure this resort is the perfect place to relax indulge and enjoy all the city has to offer. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a luxurious and unforgettable experience.
40,Found the music a little too loud in the evening when sitting in the bar to have drinks and gamble. Would have liked water and coffee machine in the room for early morning rising. But the room was fine. And staff pleasant.
30,Thebeds are vwry uncomfortable. Too much noise from room next door. Staff was not very friendly. Our trip was short but Long enough. The hotel was just ok. We will probably not stay at this hotel again.
40,Please provide or offer credits to everyone  I don’t have anything else to say. O please make sure to not use stained sheet. My sheet had a very dark stain on it made it a little on comfortable. I would like my credi or more on my next visit.
50,Amazing hotel on the strip lots close by to do... but the hotel had many things inside as well.... the buffet was delicious and had to take advantage of the bottomless mimosas... there is also a fat Tuesday's which was a plus for us and a late night food court open with many options.
20,Booked a room for the tower. Noisy room and terrible view. Absolutely horrible!!! This hotel needs to be remodeled. There was water leaking in the hallways on the 3rd floor. They did not clean it up swiftly.
30,Mobile check in was fantastic room needed updated amenities shops were way over priced pyramid cafe was great /staff friendly as can be…. Good variety of slots could have been more table variety and more appealing minimums.
50,Room was clean beds were comfortable. Hot water in the shower worked. Loved how fast the elevators were just didn't like how the key reader in the elevators didn't work all the time or give you time to put the key to it and choose your floor. Need better eating options in the hotel. Casino are was nice and all the workers were friendly. Registration desk was terribly slow. I checked in on my phone but still needed keys made for the elevator. It was 1 o'clock in the morning and only 5 people ahead of me and I waited 30 minutes. Other than those few minor problems I would definitely stay here again.
50,Enjoyed my Valentine's day stay. People were nice and had fun. Diablo restaurant was great! Shrimp tacos were delicious and waitress was pleasant. The rooms were cozy and comfy. I was able to access internet without any issues. I will visit again!
50,Love the Luxor Hotel. Definitely made first time in Vegas awesome. I wish there was a microwave and refrigerator. Also to be able to get towels was hard so if we could have gotten them more often that would be good.
50,Location cleanliness and sleep quality when you out all of them together that’s what I am looking for to enjoy a stay in a place and found that on my stay at Luxor hotel I will book it again on my next stay in Vegas
10,Don't stay at this hotel. The Parking garage is too far from the casino floor room towers and elevators. This hotel doesn't have adequate services for people with disabilities. My recommendation for further travelers to Las Vegas. If you want to stay at a very cheap hotel you can stay at the Luxor. If you prefer quality and comfort don't stay at this hotel!!!!
30,Did not like paying for parking. The overall hotel was decent for gambling I like the casino layout. The rooms were relatively clean but not the greatest attention to detail dust around Also TV had poor quality needs replaced for what its worth
40,Busy schedule over 4 days not one moment of interruption. Shows right there in the hotel help with a busy schedule to include some fun. And obviously the casinos. Be weary of a couple of the electronic store in the hotel as the products are not of good quality and over priced
50,Had a great Superbowl Weekend at the Luxor again it's a yearly trip with family and friends. Took in the AGT LIVE show and it was great. In the past we have seen Carrot Top and the Blue Man Group also all great shows.
20,"room was terrible filthy no fridge carpet dirty over-all terrible.  when we asked to be moved we were told that we'd have to pay more because we rec'd such a great deal ""thats why we rec'd the room we got"" (so basically we got what we paid for) so Luxor deals means its a MAJOR DOWN GRAGE"
10,I didn't request an accessible room but got one assigned to me. There was no water handheld spot on the top to take a shower comfortably. The curtain wasn't long enough so all the shower water flooded the bathroom floor. I slipped and had to use up all the towels to soak up the water.
10,Do not waste your time doing here please take the time to shop around at different hotels that respects their guest and honor what they tell you I was Lured in and lied to you and taken advantage of!!
40,Friendly Staff  Carrot Top is a great show  Smell is alittle muggy. We stayed a few months ago and it was pleasant then.  Gambling area is comfortable.  Gentlemen that took our bets for the Superbowl game was very helpful
10,Previously I primarily have said I wouldn't stay at the Luxor as in the past I thought it was over rated and over priced with the lack of hospitality and up keep with a poor floor plan. I unfortunately didn't follow that suggestion and had a friend stay at the resort So I decided to stay close to them. When I made the reservation through my company I was offered a rate that I thought was acceptable considering the time frame and the space availability. After agreeing to the booking price it was then changed to a higher rate. So after the the resort fee was charged I ended up paying more then twice the amount I agreed to for a place I really didn't want to be so immediately I was drown back to being severely disappointed with the entire experience. Then there was the location of the room it was nowhere close to where I thought it was nor near my travel companions  it seemed to be about as far away as it could down a long deserted hallway that seemed like it should have been a staff entrance. All in all it made me feel like I was going to work/sleep in a toilet room. So #1 when you work at a company with 90k employees you get to see and hear a lot of experiences both good and bad and this experience brought my second chance right back to thinking the Luxor is #2. and with the ability to fly anywhere in the world that rare opportunity to spend time with family that doesn't fly at all it was very disappointing. I agreed to a reservation price that was changed and the standard to addressing this issue is that its the app used to make the reservation. That is not at all correct in my opinion I have been using the same program for more than 30 years with my employer and I know that the prices are not dictated by them its an agreement from the vendor thus being MGM resorts. so for anyone to not own that is insulting.
50,I had so much fun with my family. The kids were able to get where they could have fun and they were safe as they didn't have to leave the building. It was blast and the food options were great. The beds were very comfy and the shower pressure was phenomenal
30,Our bed was lumpy and uncomfortable. Tv was hung in awkward position so hard to watch it from bed. Coffee shiop/restaurant off main floor closed at 3pm. Video poker machines were ancient and few in number.
50,Plenty space in my hotel. Check in was a little long but my company 711 had triple the amount of people since they bought speedway so it was understandable. Everyone was friendly and showed me where I had to go. Always shuttle for 7ee was available so that help my transportation a lot. Trade show showed a lot of new things I was so pleased. I will come back even for vacation lots of sites to see on the strip.
20,The Luxor is dated. Very dated. After staying here many times over the years it’s time for a different spot. The inclinators in the pyramid. Sheesh. From top to bottom it’s time for a rehab of this hotel.
10,The staff here were unwelcoming and generally rude. They all seemed to be irritated with our presence and didn't make any effort to be friendly or helpful. Even though you pay premium prices to stay at an MGM property the experience was lackluster and I had much better experiences at Aria Vdara Venetian and Palazzo.
10,Don’t even think about staying at this property even it is free. Rooms are terrible casino might be the tightest of any place I’ve ever gambled. Elevator’s are extremely slow no refrigerator or safe in my room. They only cleaned my room once during a four night stay! They need to bull doze this place down and rebuild something new or get new management.
40,It was my first trip to Vegas. Had an amazing stay. Was in awe by the fixtures throughout the hotel. My room was very clean and comfortable.  1 issue I did have I was not aware you needed to use key card for elevator. Should have been told at check in. I have stayed at other hotels that do not use this system. However I felt more secure.  Thanks for your service.
50,Vegas was my moms bucket list trip!  We seen Americas got talent Superstars and Tournament of Kings  Great shows!!!!  The staff were all friendly and the service was good. Lots of shops and dining right in the Casino.
30,The Luxor has so much potential. Imagine the staying at the pyramids of giza and how Awsome that would be. At first glance that's what the Luxor is trying to accomplish but once you make it past the front desk you realize this is a run down old truck stop motel 8 in disguised as a pyramid. It's unfortunate.
40,Enjoyed my stay especially dinning in at Tender. Would definitely visit again . Rooms should come with refrigerator and microwave. Fix the digital key elevator access. Had to retreat to the old school card way
50,Luxor is one of my favorite places to stay the staff is amazing food is good when we requested more blankets they were brought quickly. The tram is a great quick way to get to two of the other casinos faster. We will be back again!
50,Beautiful hotel friendly service. Love the Egyptian theme. Enjoyed the convenience of shopping inside of the hotel. Loved the night club Flight which is opened 24/7. The Luxor souvenir pyramid cup which is filled to the brim with an adult slushy could last you the entire night! Loved it had a great time can’t wait to stay again!
50,The staff was friendly with high energy. That was needed after a long flight from the east coast. The main restaurant had delicious food. The atmosphere felt private and the room was spacious. I would most definitely stay there on vacation.
10,Rooms are absolutely disgusting definitely not what I thought I was getting and especially for the price. Super disappointed and will not ever stay here again. The staff is rude the whole building smells and compared to other casinos this one is the worst
50,Our go to place when we are in Vegas which is several times a year. The place is clean staff is friendly ambience is nice. The rooms need a bit of updating but everything was nice and clean. We have stayed at most of the MGM properties and always come back to the Luxor.
50,This place was so cool and warming I like this place a lot I deff would recommend this place to anyone who want to be at a great hotel me and my friends got in the room quick and on time no problem need to go back again
50,Everything was perfect from when i landed my ride was right on time all the way up until we went home and the room was amazing and I wanted to thank Leah for setting up everything for me I really appreciate everything you do thanks Pat
10,There's on set of elevators and my room was on the opposite side. Long walk to get to the room. The room looked nice and I was there on business. I keep smelling a cleaning solution smell. Not only in my room but in the whole hotel. Especially by the restrooms. It burned my nose and throat. The toilet paper and tissues are so thin you have to fold them in half to be regular one ply. The worst part is the internet would just stop working for 15 minutes and then work again I called wireless Service and they acted like that's the way it is. I can't get any work done if I'm dropped and it can't connect to the server. When I checked out they acted like that's normal and couldn't care less. Parking was $18
10,We had got a non-smoking room and upon entering it was apparent the previous person smoked in the room. Then we got locked out of our rooms and had to pay once more for another night. Not only that but there are buttons missing in the elevators the area is rundown. It’s an overpriced motel on the strip.
10,Staff at checkin and checkout are cold and unwelcoming. When you ask questions they act like you are bothering them. HVAC in our room was never fixed or the smell was never investigated and housekeeping never once cleaned our room in the 5 days we were there. Save your money and stay at the Excalibur. The staff are way more friendly and so helpful
20,Stayed over Super Bowl weekend. Found a bum sleeping in the tunnel leading to the parking garage. Elevators were in very bad shape. Giant Americas got Talent sign on the front of the pyramid blocks view for almost all rooms. Price is not a bargain once the resort fee is added. Excalibur next door is also owned by MGM is cheaper and in my opinion better quality. Some cocktail waitresses were very inattentive completely ignoring customers who ask for a drink. TV in room goes on volume 30 every time it is turned on.
30,Great place to stay without breaking the bank and cool things to do on the property. They seemed to stop taking great care of this Hotel so the lack of attention to detail make a stay here not luxurious.
20,I had trouble talking to staff because of their attitude for no reason and I try to go to upper management but upper management transfer me to the front desk again and no one answered the phone I was disconnected
40,Plenty of amenities to choose from. It was busy but not so crowded that you couldn't play at the tables or slots. The only drawback was lack of sleep due to our room being near the icemaker on our floor.
50,Looking for a great visit to Vegas ? Look no further than the Luxor. Clean rooms  friendly staff and quiet rooms . Went in February and was pleasantly surprised that the day club pool at Mandalay Bay is free to use for Luxor guests . The infinity hot tub was great . Pool was not as warm as expected but hey it was February.
20,We were given a noisy room on the 2nd floor with a view of the parking garage wall and no cell reception. I complained and they offered me a room on the 3rd floor and told me nothing else was available. They finally gave me a room on the 21st floor when I refused the 3rd floor room. This was on a Thursday at 3pm!
50,My second visit to Vegas with a buddy and the Luxor was an awesome trip. From the front desk throughout the casino was the best trip so far. I experienced the Shark exhibit which was a wonderful adventure. I will stay again at the Luxor!!!!
20,Just a Cheap old hotel and smells bad and the access to rooms is very difficult. Room was clean TV and Internet were in and out no water in the room and the walls are thin. I heard a couple fighting all night next door.
10,"The offers and prices will lure you in.... But beware! Lots of flooding issues in the hotel. Then the flooding made its way to our bathroom. Ruined all of my expensive makeup. Over a week later and I still have not heard anything about the security report I filed for replacement. They gave us a $100 food credit that doesn't even cover a meal for 3. Security was useless. Dated hotel escalators breaking you will be ""miles"" away from your elevator. Rooms are not as pictured. There was not even a bedspread on the the bed. I would never recomend this place to a friend maybe my worst enemy. Maybe..."
10,We stayed at Mandalay Bay but used Luxor Spa…. My husband booked an 80 minute spa service on February 11th at Luxor. They had him use a locker in the men’s locker room to place his items in during the service. The Locker room attendant told him to use locker 37 and gave him a small key to it. There was only one person in the locker room which was this young guy attendant on duty. Needless to say this employee is a thief! My husband came out of spa service to retrieve his clothing and items to find an alert on his cell phone from our credit card company. ( phone was in jacket pocket and wallet in pants pocket) He called them and they said someone was physically charging to his card in stores in the last few minutes .. Apple $1200 Victoria Secret $400 Bath& Body $300 at the Town Center shopping center 1/4 mile south of Luxor.. He checked his wallet and $200 was missing as well as this credit card. Yep… Luxor has a locker room employee stealing!! They have master keys and or this locker 37 is faulty by design!!! This is organized crime meaning this employee steals and passes off to someone else that will go use the card immediately ( these charges I’m certain are gift card purchases due to the even amounts). I built a career in upper retail management so Im very familiar with theft. Needless to say DO NOT use the Spa lockers at Luxor!!! Yes a police report was filed and we were told they would review cameras and catch any employee however we are not holding our breath!! Luxor I hope you take this seriously because a thief will strike again… especially a professional one!!!
50,For years I've wanted to stay in a King Corner Suite room. Now as far as suites go i didnt expect much here other than a roomier room. This was a friends trip but we all had our own room (it is vegas). I arrived a lil earlier than check in and was still given my room w/o fee (The other major player on the strip charges for early arrival)    The King Corner has a nicely updated bathroom(the shower floor can get a lil slick) the updated wall paper behind the bed a side sitting room with a sofa & fridge and a LARGE soaking tub off to the side of the bed in front of the pyramid glass. 1st impression was I LOVED THIS ROOM for many reasons!    This room has 2 ac units in it. Normally  especially in the summer because the building is black glass it can get quite hot and usually the AC cant keep up (for someone who likes it cold). For the 1st time ever in a vegas hotel room i got cold at night and LOVED IT! Definitely spacious on my solo room stay and perfect for a couple. The king bed in this room was raised HIGH. Possibly too high for some people but my bed at home is just as high and i loved it. The room was clean although because of my insane cleaning habbits everything was sprayed with lysol and or wiped with clorox wipes IT IS VEGAS....lol    If your a rewards player and get a deal on this room type or you just want a slightly roomier room i greatly appreciated this room. I did use the soaking tub several times to relax I wish it was jetted but it still got the job done. The fridge in the room is a nice bonus to keep some waters and sodas cold. I usually prefer a tower room but i would definitely stay in this room again.
20,Just ok. The pros were that the bed & pillows were comfy & the shower was great (which are very important pros to me). Everything else was blah including the customer service. The cigarette smoke IN THE ROOM was suffocating. Most surfaces were dusty throughout the hotel & it’s just really dark & dingy. Visiting other hotels/casinos it became more apparent that the Luxor management isn’t on the same level. The spa was okay. I think my massage therapist was good but the spa touches were lacking & the fee’s weren’t up front. As far as my confirmation booking online including tip was $200 but it somehow cost $280 in the end. I most likely wouldn’t stay here again if any other hotel is comparable in price per night on the strip.
10,The room was in poor condition no water pressure in the shower and dirty room. Property and elevators was in bad shape (East Tower)! Aurora bar waitress was unfriendly and uninvited told me no specials ask for drinks and she referred me to the menu!
50,The hotel was clean . I just love staying at the Luxor it is my all time favorite place . The staff is friendly and so helpful . The only call out would be no ice machines on suite level and without the correct key it won’t let you down a level.
50,I was on a business conference February 2023. My stay at the Luxor was awesome! From staff to the room to the casino the food and the shopping were all fantastic! Everything you could possibly want to see was either within walking distance or a very short cab ride. I am hoping some day soon I will be able to take a personal trip to Las Vegas and if I do I will be staying at the Luxor!
30,The mobile check in process is abysmal. Also the mgm parking pass is so I’ll conceived that it’s more annoying in practice than just paying daily. Luxor was ok but I would suggest paying extra for better.
50,Did a staycation here and pleasantly surprised by how nice the place was lived in Vegas 30 years and have never been here. Check-In and key were on the app so easy. Everything centrally located and very convenient. Rooms all overlook everything which is cool as well.
40,The hotel is only 5 mins from the airport and with the flat rate and evening add on with tip came to $27. We had requested a Pyramid Premier two queen room & close to the lifts and this was accommodated by a person rather than a machine. The room was lovely and nicely decorated with a spacious shower room (shower pressure was really good) Unfortunately the mattresses on both beds where terrible and dipped in the middle. We did discuss requesting replacements however we were only there for 4 nights but it did make a difference to our overall rating of the hotel. The food areas varied quite considerably in price and quality as do the bars. There are several attractions and shows but do make sure you look around for discounts. We love the overall feeling of The Luxor but you need to be aware of its location in relation to the rest of the main strip.
50,If you want to have breathtaking views and exceptional experiences the Luxor hotel & casino is the place to go! The aurora bar in the lobby was my go to for a night cap wonderful atmosphere! Will definitely come back!
10,This place has gone downhill over the past 10 years. It’s dirty. The walls in the elevators are disgusting. Our bathroom was gross and dated. Shower had a cracked floor tile was cracked no make up mirror barely any toiletries provided. You definitely get what you pay for. The floor in our hallway was soaking wet from a leak and all they did was place a fan there. No one was fixing it for 3 days. The place is going downhill fast. It’s a shame.
40,Stayed here for bday celebration. Stayed in accessible room in east tower . Bed comfortable and room nice and clean. Only negative I wish there was a microwave in room for later use . Food can be expensive and you might want to save for later. Overall nice hotel .
50,Everyone was very helpful. Everything was very clean and you can tell the worked very hard to keep it that way. The person on the front desk worked with us to get all of us on the same same floor and baggage people weee every helpful to store our luggage because we got there too early and they stored our luggage again the day we left .
30,Casino was clean but rooms need a lot of help the refrigerator needs to be back in rooms also so the 5 to 6 dollar soda does not get warm and have to be thrown away the vents in the rooms need changes
50,Hotel was very nice. Diablos was very delicious. We had the brunch Buffett and that was the only disappointmet. Food all seemed frozen then just heated up. Buffet was huge but most of the food repeated through the sections. Only thing I really liked was the mini donuts and some of the pastries. Not worth $40 a person.
50,Great stay friendly staff great location. Attached to mandalay bay and Excalibur hotel makes it very easy to get around. The building itself is very cool with all the Egyptian statues. And staying in a pyramid is very fun!
10,This hotel is quite dated smells of sewer and stale cigarette immediately when you walk in. The rooms are nasty and the rugs as so gross! Very disappointing at best! I wouldn’t recommend this “hotel” to anyone!
10,Worst hotel experience of my life was wasn’t clean at all house keeping very rude. We left out for the night when we came back our hotel door was open and held open with a piece of paper. Will never stay here again
50,I’m very happy to stay Luxer. It’s so much clean nice fast and friendly service. Eveery where is so much convenience. Sartbucks Coffee other nice restaurant and bar. Prices so affordable. Very happy to stay. See you next time.
50,The room was large and spacious clean. Housekeeping was in and out quickly every day. Plenty of towels. Amazing hot water with good water pressure. Could not hear our neighbors. The way the elevator system works and each small area of the floor works makes it so that people from other areas of the hotel casino cannot get to your area without a key card. So very little foot traffic in front of our room
30,Average stay. Definitely worth the low price being an older hotel and at the end of the stop. No reception on cellphones in part of the hotel and in our room. Lack of solution when brought up the issue at the front desk. Room was nice wish there were more restaurants
40,Great stay over all for the price. Enjoyed the exhibits and shows at the hotel which was convenient. Rooms are a little dated but worked well for the days we were there. Buffet left a lot to be desired but the rest of the food onsite was good. Especially Tender Steakhouse but be prepared to pay a PRETTY penny!
40,"They give me discounted room rates even though I don't play much at MGM casinos. They also gave me a $50 food and beverage credit but no one told me until the end of my trip so I didn't get to use it. I used the mobile app to check-in which is very convenient but I was told that's why no one told me about the $50 credit. If I would have checked in at the desk they supposedly would have told me. Maybe they should told me by email or in the app.  The limits in the casino are just as high as the other MGM casinos on the strip. You have to max bet on the slots to be eligible for bonuses and blackjack only plays 6-5 at $25 limit tables. Craps with a $25 min table limits is also really high. With a $25 minimum on craps you can easily have $100's bet on each roll. Because of these high limits I can't help but Uber over to Ellis or even walk to the Oyo.  Overall I'd recommend staying at the Luxor. They are conveniently located near the airport and getting around the strip is easy from their location. You can take the free tram to Excalibur walk to the monorail across the street at MGM or take the cheap double-decker city bus ""Deuce"" down the strip and to Downtown."
40,Very close to everything you need shuttle and tram service on point staff was on point food was pricey but the quality was worth it rooms were clean and dead were comfortable the choice between shower and soaking it up in jetted tub was a bonus
50,The only issue I had with my room was that someone took my charger pice for my charger and also there was not a thicker comforter to use. I am from NY and I would have like a thicker comforter for the night.
30,Work affairs thanks need more people working and breakfast in the morning more business no refresh event in the front desk hope next time wait on the line for check in will be very fast customer service number one
50,The place was magnificent. I have never been to Vegas before but I surely will be back. The staff was friendly the food was good everywhere I ate my room was clean and the casino was fun. They seem like they go above and beyond.
30,Rent an air b and b you’ll be better off and more comfortable! I don’t even recall a menu for room service (if there is room service) there was no fridge nor microwave! First time to Vegas and this place wasn’t it!!!
10,The rooms are dirty. The plugs don’t work. The fixtures are covered in dust. The lamp shades are not even screwed on. Tile broken in the bathroom and or missing. Tub was dirty. Rooms need a lot of attention.
20,My room key did not operate the elevator so I had to make the long walk back from the elevator to the front desk three times before they decided to give me a room in another tower. I was told at check-in that my room would not be available for two days of my stay due to a convention. There was music playing all night outside my window the entire stay. The occupants of the room next to us were very loud and noisy late into the night. At times it seemed as if we were sharing a room with them. The maids failed to clean our room on the second day of our stay. We left the hotel and returned later that afternoon. Their cart was parked across the hall from us so we assumed that they would be taking care of our room next. That did not happen. My wife eventually went out to ask about room service and they had moved down the hall by that time. She just asked for clean towels and face cloths as at that point we were tired and wanted a nap. We will no longer consider the Luxor for future stays in Las Vegas.
20,Was my birthday week and you guys had no special things you do for birthdays plus the rooms were out dated for the price I paid it was not a good stay I will not be recommending this place or staying there anymore
10,It was just a bad experience that cost too much. The food had a lesser quality tha mcdonalds but cost as much as a fine dining experience. Don't eat here. You can only travel to the floor you stay on. Check in takes forever. The rooms smell of mold and the furniture is musty. It's in a bad location making it expensive to get around.
40,Everything was good except the digital card hardly worked in the elevators. Also wish there was a fridge and microwave to heat leftovers. Overall it was a good place to sleep and relax for the weekend.
10,The place is old and dirty not well maintained. Better to stay at Caesar’s or Belagio for the same price. The staff was very friendly and helpful though. After a fairly messy check in process they gave us a penthouse that wound up having bugs in it. Didn’t stay for the second night.
50,Location is everything on my vacation and this one is exceptional clean room great breakfast at the restaurant and the entire experience was great. Thanks to the staff and I really recommend that you use their app to make the check in process and pay your parking in advance doing this you are going to Save a lot of your time.
40,The Luxor was great. The only issue we had was that the thermostat could not be set lower than 65. We were hot a few times. Items in the little shop were expensive but you expect that when you go to Vegas. The Service was outstanding.
20,Rooms do not include refrigerators microwave or coffee pot. This was not communicated ahead of time may be in the small print but I did t see it. They want you to pay additional fees for these items and will BS you by telling you it’s because people were tearing them up when Covid started. Well that’s BS the real reason is they want to nickel and dime you to death!!
50,Great restaurants great shows fun time to just allow yourself to refuel & reward yourself. Truly a wonderful way to escape the grind and eat drink from many fun and great restaurants. An adventure in one location without ever having to leave the resort. A wonderful way to rejuvenate a worn out mindset.
40,The pyramid is an exceptional place to explore with live music fun games and good food! The staff was exceptional! The spa is very pleasant and relaxing. The shows were great and the views were breathtaking!
20,The room was very dark. Poor ventilation and felt very humid after shower. Everything felt dingy. Ceiling had water damage marks and some look  like mold. Poor choice of food. First hotel that I have been to that did not have a refrigerator.
50,This trip was one to remember. Very friendly staff that greeted you warmly and treated you kindly. Displayed patience when I had card difficulties from traveling out of state awarded me a food credit when my hotel keys didn't work. Overall I was well taken care of!
50,Really nice experience. I got the reservation from a third party. But yet everything worked fine. The room was clean and seamed renewed recently. We were in a family plan with kids and the experience was really friendly.
50,If you come here expecting the luxury of Bellagio or Aria you'll likely be disappointed but that is an unfair expectation. Luxor is great for the more down to earth Vegas experience with reasonable prices clean and nicely appointed rooms plenty of restaurants late night food (Waypost Deli !) and fun casino. Plus the pyramid design is just amazing. Easily walk to Mandalay Bay or Excalibur for even more options. We love the fancier MGM options as well but Luxor is our main Vegas destination!
30,For being on The Strip rates are pretty good. Not sure if I’ll stay again but it was decent enough I’ll recommend to others. The room was very basic which I was expecting at those prices they also have blackout curtains so don’t have to worry about the light keeping you up! Checkin was probably the fastest and most expedited I’ve ever experienced which has its positives and negatives. First hotel checkin I’ve ever done that no conversation other than what was absolutely necessary to checkin was had. Thankfully I’m the sort to walk around and explore so figured out most stuff on my own. For those interested use of hot tub is a separate charge was $30/person (per visit) when we went. Which was more than I was willing to pay. Used to spending a full day at a Korean day spa at that price. But at least it looks fairly nice from the pictures. Fairly quick access from here to Mandalay Bay to Excalibur. There’s also a bus stop just outside and the Deuce travels up and down The Strip fairly fast for a city bus. Overall location and stay was fairly decent. If you’re looking for a basic place with good room rates I would recommend this place. Just remember if you’re also looking for free parking you’ll likely be looking outside The Strip. Parking is only free if you’re of a higher level tier in their membership or military (which is a different membership card they count retirees as well!).
40,Our room was spacious with 2 double beds great power shower and toiletries but no kettle or fridge. There is a good bar downstairs opposite the checkin desk serving beer and simple cocktail mix ( spirit + soft drink ) for $5 + tax ( the Aurora) . Usually this would be $11-16 elsewhere.  The lifts go diagonally and the balcony from the higher floors are vertiginous but we had a great time there. Easy walkways through to the Excalibur and New York New York and to Mandalay bay. It’s about a 45-50 minute walk from the Belagio and the bus ‘Deuce’ serves the area well - riding all the way up to the Mob museum and Fremont Street. Unfortunately the natural history museum was shut at 4 pm on Sundays. Deuce drives past many shotgun wedding venues!! Fun
50,I've stayed away from the Luxor because of whay I've heard in the past about being out dated but a convention was going on and all the other Casinos had raised their prices way up. Luxor pricing was the best around and was nice to see that everything had received a facelift. Beautiful resort with very nice rooms. My only complaint is having to use key card to access your floor. That was a pain when youre trying to use your digital key and no signal. so make sure you have a physical card on the elevator. Oh and the water pressure is amazing. Best shower of my life. lol
50,Great Vibe at this property! The check in process with the app is great! The buffet was incredible! Food court and cafe are perfect to feed your craving. The bar in the middle of casino has the best happy hour! Perfect Place!
10,Biggest issue was no cell service at all in the room and that issue was never resolved and frankly not sure anyone tried. Tech support was hard to reach difficult to understand and not helpful. Bluetooth keys did not work well. Guests should get the plastic keys
30,"Checked in after a long day and only realised (half way to the room) that the room allocated by the receptionist wasn't the Pyramid Premier Two Queen I had booked so trudged back to reception queued saw a different receptionist who told me that it was hotel policy to ""upgrade"" Virgin Holiday customers to a Tower room but offered a change to a Pyramid room but commented in his opinion it would be a downgrade. So despite my B.S. meter twitching took the tower room.    Actually the room was quite adequate and comfortable but not as absolutely clean as I'd have expected on arrival. and despite the beds and towels being changed every day of our 7 night stay the cleanliness of the room didn't improve with area's of dust remaining untouched and physical evidence either a better vacuum cleaner was needed or one needed to be used but maybe the ambiance was supposed to be as dusty and dirty as a newly unearthed Pyramid(?). In deciding whether or not to complain I gauged it was possibly no dirtier than my home (before I clean) and considered my health was not at risk - so didn't complain. So why is my review even mentioning this? It's a note to help other Trippers decide whether to stay at the Luxor.  I came to the conclusion that these hotel chains can spend as much as they like of refurbishments but if the building isn't kept clean it (in my opinion) is money wasted.  The hotel itself is at one end of the Strip and if I were to go to Vegas again this would help my decision not to book the Luxor again    Having walked through many of the Strip / Casino's during my stay I would say Excalibur and New York New York were probably built at the same time as the Luxor and ""themed"" hotels have passed their sell by for me."
10,Staff at the front desk were not helpful at all. We had booked a massage at the spa  we called to see the options but the stuff at the SPA couldn’t wait to hang up on us. We paid for two days of parking and we were told we could use a room key to exit the parking. But it never worked eventhough we went to front desk 2 times reporting the problem. Every time we had to ring the bell at the parking gate and wait for somebody to answer and open the gate. We paid to have a late check out at 3:00 we came back to our room at 1 o’clock and the cleaning people were cleaning the room for the next guest. I wouldn’t stay there again  I wouldn’t recommend it to anyone.
40,Great staff rooms are great size but fridge and coffee machine would be nice. Far from strip but easy bus access if willing to hop on and off. Lots to do within the hotel. Titanic was beyond amazing. The Diablo's Cantina has the best staff and food
30,The hotel and casino smelled of smoke a lot more then other hotels that we visited. Several lights were broken or hanging out of the ceiling. The iron didn’t work properly and was leaking water everywhere when you tried to use it. Also the shower was very hard to change the temperature when showering. The staff was nice and the spa was very enjoyable.
50,Great customer service rooms clean  love the updated rooms  my room was ready at 10 am. And that was without paying for a early check in  I would strongly recommend the Luxor to everyone. Hasn’t let me down yet …
40,Stayed in the premium king size room in the Pyramid. Very large and spacious room. Wish they had a coffee maker in the room. Overall it was a nice hotel with plenty of eating options on the Excalibur and Mandalay Bay sides. Best Mexican place was on the Mandalay Bay side. Ate there 2 nights in a row.
30,Rooms were basic no slippers provided in room so bring your own (feet hurt after long hours of walking and then having to stand on tiles to get ready) beds were comfy stayed in the tower. Overall not bad just not as fancy as the other hotels but good value for your dollar
50,Very clean. Staff was friendly and helpful when we had questions. Cocktail waitress was quick and friendly. Exhibits were cool and food was very delicious. Easy access to neighboring hotels. MGM is great.
30,Thought luxor was a luxury hotel several years back and noticed they were cheaper this time around. Was not aware they had resort fees that added up to 120 bucks additional. Water stunk and even staff joked how bad the elevators were. Lots of entertainment near or in which was good but they need to cut resort fees and redo some things. Room was needinf update. Bathrooms looked modern enough but tub and cealing leaked
20,Like I said the room was so poor the carpet looked dirty  We tried to buy a movie and screen says low signal  Tv reception was horrible  No fridge for our leftover foods  And our curiosity extended check out was not honored after the lady said we can leave at 12pm
30,The experience at Luxor is okay. America's Got Talent was the best part. The worst part was when the security officers laughed at my concern for someone trying to sell drugs. These words are to go over the 200 minimum.
40,The stay was great. We attended for ProBowl. The restaurants had good portions and the drinks were wonderful. Everything was good the service could’ve been a little better and a microwave would’ve been nice.
40,The hotel was a little out dated but it was clean and the staff was friendly and helpful. Bed was comfy good sized room. We ate at 3 of the resturants the food was good and staff friendly. A great place to stay for my first time in Vegas!!
40,Rooms were dusty and in our room there was crumbling ceiling from what appeared to be a water leak of some sort. Trash was left behind the dresser and in the garbage can upon check in. Then when we chose to NOT have the room serviced while we were there they came in anyway and made the bed and tool the do not disturb sign off our door. Friendly staff just old and dirty rooms.
30,The Luxor is in a great location if you're going to Allegiant Stadium it's in walking distance approximately 10-15 minutes. The room was clean but the beds were not comfortable however the entertainment there is fabulous cause it's an MGM property and you're connected with all of the latest shows and activities fabulous restaurants.
30,Tower room away from the busy part of the strip allowed for quality sleep. Lovely soaking tub. Walk way to fun bars at Mandalay Bay was convenient. Resort fee charge for no resort benefit was a downer. Overall prices of drinks unbelievable! Not the Vegas I remember at 21.
10,"No water upon arrival No one willing to be honest or help. Would only come clean the room when they pleased - even though we could only get them to come two times in a 6 day stay. Room that was promised was not received and lets not forget prior to arrival they kept ""losing"" my reservation. Wouldn't recommend this MGM Property Stay at the Aria its the place to be"
10,Absolutely disgusting rooms not clean at all!  Staff was ok  Floors not clean at all carpets gross hair from previous people all over. The only thing that semi worked was the AC unit. If anyone in the hallways wisher you will hear it at all times of the day.
30,Location is good  Hotel is old an not up dated even the elevator is in rough condition  Used to be a nicer hotel not taken care of  Quality did not exist from the bedsheets to the toiletries sad to see this place so run down  Location I’d good
50,This experience was the best ever. I love the room and staff. They food was amazing and free champagne. The walk was a little far but it was easy to find. I would recommend this hotel to all my friends.
50,Every moment from check in to check out was spot on!!!! Restraunts gaming shows ...we did it all!! Great family time . ALL AGES!!! THANK YOU HOUSEKEEPING!! THANK YOU ALL!!! THX HOST OTT!!! Can't wait to get back to Vegas!!!
20,The hotel was extremely noisy (at my room) with loud music playing all night.  Check out took us 45 minutes as we needed to correct the double charge at the parking this has pushed all our road trip plans late of course!  The hotel is BEAUTIFUL though!
40,How can such a nice place not have little refrigerators and especially coffee makers OR a coffee bar? I don’t wanna wait 15 minutes and pay 7$ at Starbucks. The rooms otherwise were good and clean and quiet. Checking in was kind of crazy as the lines were huge but they did have a mobile check in which helped.
40,Nice and clean and convenient. No in room coffee makers. Not happy about that at all especially when I called in advance to ask and was told coffee makers were in the rooms. C  Room was clean and I need the location for a seminar.
40,Good location with good views. Good entertainment. Rooms were clean and very spacious with very comfortable beds. We will Most definitely will stay there again. Easy to get to other casinos from that location
20,Took 45 minutes to check in and we were on hold to reach housekeeping for another 45 mins. Took almost an hour for an extra blanket to arrive. Elevator and ever wall has something amiss - just so beat up. Shower was clean and water was hot but that is about all I can say was good
30,Beds were comfortable but overall the entire casino hotel rooms all need a good deep cleaning and maintenance! Many of the dealers never say thank you when tipped. Elevators in very poor condition don’t open with sensors emergency panels wide open…
20,Housekeeping was terrible. Had to call twice to get clean towels and room cleaned. The first time they brought towels and that was it. They finally cleaned our room on the last day after my second call
20,The room was below par. The bathroom tiles are very slippery when wet and I slipped and fell. If you plan on eating or doing other thing in the hotel plan on spending a lot of money. It is very expensive
10,Time to actually renovate the rooms. You advertise that the rooms are renovated. They haven’t been touched in decades. Elevators are in terrible shape. Lucky they actually worked. It’s time to take some of that MGM Vegas money and upgrade.
10,Here's a quick list of things that went wrong:    - Elevators were regularly down  - There's no elevator near the Uber area for wheelchairs to use  - The dark and musky environment got old fast  - The TV is as old as the pyramid very poor quality  - No one was willing to help us on the floor when trying to use the slots  - The two men at the cashier were very rude  - THE WIFI WAS DOWN for a large part of the trip which made working remote impossible    And so on...    The best part about staying here was the bellman who helped us check out... not just because he was actually pleasant and very accommodating but because he was helping us escape this hell hole.
10,Room was filthy and elevator covered in vomit. Previous guest left drugs in nightstand. Best part was “ what do you expect? This is Vegas”  Place is on par with a trailer park. Do yourself a favor and spend the extra money on a nicer place.
20,"The room was okay as far as a cheap room goes cleanliness was okay. However I received an email saying I could have an ""upgrade"" for $2.00 more per night. I chose that. I have NO idea what could have been upgraded. The rooms view was a view of a sidewalk to the front of the actual hotel filthy with trash."
50,It was a great stay and great birthday party at Diablo Cantina. My granddaughter turned 21. So we ate drank and had a great celebration. This is the first time my granddaughter stayed at the Luxor and she loved it!!
20,"The ""upgraded"" room we got was so old and run down. Wall paper was peeling the room was smelly and stuffy there was no microwave there was no coffee maker/coffee there were no cups or glasses in the room the room was big but there was only ONE chair which makes no sense of how you used the room space and why was the hot tub by the beds instead of in the sitting room area where there was NO furniture. Overall a horrible design and a horrible room"
10,Luxor has wholly lost its former glory starting from black glass exterior covered in years of dirt to the dirty/stained carpet on the inside. Smoking of the first level makes it hard to breath.Rooms offer just the bare minimum: no coffee or tea water or even hair conditioner is not offered. Stail air coming from the outdated air conditioners in the room offered a constant opportunity for a headache. At over $300 per night the hotel is at the point of no return for me.
20,"Just the overall condition of the hotel casino has fallen off in the last few years. The ""pot"" smell and cigarette smell and filthy musty smell can be overwhelming. The overall cleanliness is bad. The street people who wondering in and out of casino has also increased. We will not be staying at Luxor anytime soon. We have been staying there for the past 5 years until now."
50,Rooms are remodeled very comfortable and clean. The elevators are a bit on the older side that would be my only complain. But other than that rooms are really good. Definitely better than what you’re paying for.
10,I will not recommend this hotel to anyone. The first signed is when I got there to the hotel I arrived around 1am. The rep put in the note when I first booked. I get there and we are tired just to be told our room was given to someone else and it was booked. I had already paid my deposit and upgraded to suite in a tour. The rep gave us a room in the hotel we previous booked but upgraded from. I called the next morning just to be moved to a new room and it was filthy. I took pictures of how nasty and dirty the place was. I am still thinking about posting the pictures so others could be aware.
40,Room was clean and comfortable the pool was not functioning. Overall my stay was great I was given a complementary parking pass I was happy to have this. I wish it included complementary breakfast.
10,Luxor  We left our house at 04:30am the day of arrival. The front desk was awesome and put us in room 16317 & 16316. My wife was busy unpacking our bags when the problems began. I used the restroom in 16317 and upon flushing the toilet it reacted like a bidet shooting water out. Standing there confused and dumbfounded I flushed the toilet again. The toilet again acted like a bidet shooting water out. I told my wife not to touch any plumbing until I had a chance to verify that it worked properly. I opened up every faucet tub shower only to find that all of the plumbing had air in the lines. I was not able to get all of the air out of the toilet in 16317 but it was no longer shooting out like a bidet.    Our next bad Luxor experience came as we went to the Pyramid Cafe. We were seated in a timely manner and received our raspberry tea. 45 minutes later a server showed up and took our order. 20 minutes later the sever handed me the bill and expected me to pay it. Having not even seen the food that we ordered I was a little confused. I paid the bill and 25 minutes later our food showed up. All of the food was burnt and oddly enough it was cold. Being an insulin dependent diabetic I did not have the choice to leave and eat someplace else. We managed to eat this garbage that was served to us. The server that brought our raspberry tea stopped by and asked how everything was to which I replied terrible. I asked to speak with the manager and she said that she would send her over. 25 minutes later the server that took our order stopped by and asked how everything was to which I replied awful. I asked him to speak with the manager and he said he would send her over. A few minutes later he returned and said the manager had a personal emergency and had to leave. He handed me two generic business cards with the Luxor main phone number and said that I could call the manager tomorrow. The managers name was nowhere on either of these business cards which really confused me.    My wife got us dinner from the Back Stage Deli which we ate in the room. It was very good and finally put a positive spin on a bad overall day.    Day 2 started with the Luxor breakfast buffet. That meal was so bad it should have been criminal. Scrambled eggs tasted like dirt. Fried potatoes were cold and not fully cooked. Bacon had more grease than an oil lube facility. Fresh fruit could have possibly been recovered from another casinos trash. Biscuits and gravy made me want to cry. Biscuits were harder than rocks and gravy had less flavor than an old folks home.    We opted for the Tender Steakhouse for dinner in fear of another crappy meal elsewhere. The food was edible but not overly great.    Going back to the room looking something positive on the day. My wife turned on the lamp on her side of the bed. It was blinking and shorting out. At this point my wife was very upset because of how bad this trip was going. I told her it was late and I would get the electrically unsafe lamp taken care of in the morning.    Day 3 started with us stopping by the VIP lounge. We told them about our electrically unsafe lamp. They apologized and said they would get housekeeping to take care of it.    We left the Luxor property to be able to get a decent edible meal. Upon returning to our room 16317 my wife had a severe anxiety attack. Come to find out housekeeping took the electrically unsafe lamp and put it on my side of the bed. When I was able to calm my wife down I called housekeeping my self. I explained the situation and their failure to fix the problem. They sent a couple of guys up with a replacement lamp. Neither one wanted to plug this bad lamp in and test it.    My Son arrived late and we treated him to the Back Stage Deli. They did not disappoint the food was great again.    Day 4 We had planned to take in a show and came back to the room 16317 to rest up before the Show. My son said that the floor is wet and his socks were soaked. I said that’s not possible you only walked from 16316 through the combining door in to 16317 and there is no water source. Wrong behind the combining doors was an A/C unit leaking water. I called housekeeping and they sent up a couple of guys. The guys both felt the floor and agreed “yep the carpet is wet”. They sent up a guy from engineering who felt the carpet and said “the carpet is wet”. We left and went to our Show and had a great time down at Planet Hollywood. Came back to the room and the engineer had turned that one A/C unit down to 60 degrees which did not solve the water leaking problem. My wife broke down and cried.    Drink Service on the gaming floor was literally non existent. We found a table games manager who put us in contact with Miranda the drink service manager. She brought us a couple of drinks roughly 45 minutes later. Oddly we had tracked down a wonderful drink server named Stacy who had already brought us drinks.    The loss of wifi and water our last night did not effect us very much. We had already learned that Dining Gaming and Drink Service was better any place outside of the Luxor.    In good conscience the only things that we can recommend at the Luxor is the Back Stage Deli the Titanic exhibit King Tut exhibit and the Bodies exhibit. In our opinion everything else at the Luxor is a waste of time and money.    David Okert
20,Was in a king spa suite and Room need work and elevators take forever to get you to your room looks like no one has worked on them in years. Wanted to play pai gow and let it ride I had to either walk to another casino or take a taxi to another casino.
40,Nice room and decent location but bathroom tub was dirty and had hair in it. Friendly staff and quick check in. wouldn’t mind staying again just needs to be cleaned up a little better before hand. Over all 8/10.
40,We stayed in room 4128 Pyramid View King room. Our room was cleaned daily. The bed was comfortable but did have the appearance of the high quality air mattress as it sat relatively close to the floor. The shower pressure was more than sufficient.    We downloaded the MGM app so we avoided the front desk check-in process. A lot of the restaurants (within the hotel) closed early 10-11pm so you will likely have dine while out in the city. The food court was open later than the other restaurants but not many options.    The only horrendous part was the smell of the elevators! Smells like the toilet drains are affixed to the outside elevator (sarcasm).    If you have time and want a couple of free perks the downstairs attendants and casino associates will bombard you every time you walk by for a timeshare presentation. We attended the one for Wyndham and the presentation was at a Wyndham location.    You will be rushed into making a decision but whichever presentation you attend use a moment to google reviews and search for Facebook groups of other owner experiences of that particular “timeshare” before making a decision on purchasing.    If you’re indecisive about purchasing be sure to ask about cancellation if you decide to buy and have buyers remorse!    This hotel was away from the hustle and bustle of the city but still within walking distance. I was under the impression that there would be scenic views but there wasn’t.    Once I return I would likely stay elsewhere to get the full Vegas vibe. Nothing against Luxor but I prefer to be where there’s action :-)
30,Be aware that the Luxor does not have coffee makers refrigerators or decent blankets in the room. They force you to go downstairs (after waiting for elevator for a long time) in your pajamas and morning face to wait in line at Starbucks to spend an exorbitant amount of money for a quick pick me up drink. There was also no maid for the entire weekend we were there
40,Great time with kids! We came for the pro bowl and we were able to walk to the stadium. Saved money with walking there. Staff was very friendly and great help finding things. Blue man was fantastic and the BEST dinner at Diablos cantina.
40,I was hesitant to book based on some of the bad reviews but it was all fine. Room 7202 was nice clean but a little dark but that is the theme of the whole place. Was a slight smokey smell (the room was non-smoking) but dissipated once we were settled in the room (or we just got used to it?) There was a constant hum from something mechanical like the air system (?) that never shut off as a light sleeper it was annoying. Had a nice view to the west out our window. Bathroom was nice and clean as well. Could have used some hair conditioner to go with the shampoo yes I could have asked but was on a tight schedule so I didn't want to bother with it. Most annoying thing was the digital key through the app. Even though I had it all set up ahead of time each time I went to use the elevator/get in the room it asked me to re-verify my identity which isn't the easiest thing to do. Go for the key card probably way easier. All in all a good stay lots to see eat drink and do throughout the hotel.
10,I reserved a two bed room for four of us. By the time we got there someone had given our room to other guests. The staff member was apologetic but we were forced to sleep in a one king bed room with the promise of an upgrade for the second night. What we got for the second night was the two queen bed suite. Yep that’s the room I originally reserved. We were also promised room credit in the amount of $150. No credit showed on the final bill. I paid for parking with all the room charges only to find out that I had to pay again when we were leaving. $92 for parking for two days. All of this adds up to almost criminal neglect of Luxor customers. Will absolutely never go back here.
20,Horrible hotel. Out-dated rooms. No cable. Hard towels. Uncomfortable bed and pillows. No microwave mini fridge or even coffee maker. No USB outlets for electronics. I felt as if I was back in the 80s.
30,Luxor has very friendly staff members. Unfortunately there are non guest trying to enter the floors. Management needs to start paying more attention. Buffet was okay. I am vegan so very limited choices however they had nice veggies...not sure if I return for a buffet as it's a bit pricey for few veggies.
40,This was our kid’s trip to Vegas. They had such a wonderful trip. They loved the aesthetic of the hotel and had so much fun with all of the exhibits. I will be using my MGM rewards to book another trip soon.
50,The value and cleanliness of the rooms & MGM's military benefits are awesome. I was impressed by the upgrade to Pearl status from being a military retiree/veteran. Layout of the Luxor is easy to navigate & food choices are good. I have been to Vegas many times but now MGM stands out & I will look forward to coming back.
50,The updated rooms in the pyramid were great! The place was clean and very nice! Also loved gambling there and the live music! Location on strip was right where we wanted to be. Will definitely return!!
40,This was my 1st time staying at the Luxor Premium Towers would definitely stay again and highly recommend it. Close to the MGM NYNY Mandalay Bay Delano and Excalibur hotels. The staff was friendly and courteous. If you want a hotel close to the Allegiant stadium this is the place..
50,This stay was great. The Luxor had many amenities where you don't have to leave your hotel. Great restaurants and activities. The property was phenomenal. It was close by to mostly everything on the strip and the major attractions. Highly recommend!
40,Stayed at the Luxor for the Builders Show. The hotel was clean and had good service. Check in had a little issue however I was able to resolve it in a timely fashion. Buffet was closed due to a grease line problem.
10,Terribly outdated rooms. Very poor housekeeping. No hot water only mildly warm. Aggressive prostitutes and drug dealers on the casino floor. Price gouging in full effect. Switched to a nicer Caesar's property for half the cost
30,This hotel will nickel and dime you to death provide mediocre service and accommodations. Make the most of your Vegas experience and stay in a much better hotel you will thank me later!!!! I recommend moving further down the strip so you can more easily walk to other attractions and venues and not have to rely so much on cabs.
20,If cigarette smoke doesn’t bother you The hotel would be fine.. First room I was given (10th floor) I had to change because either someone was smoking on the floor in the rooms next to me or the smoke coming from the casino traveled up onto the floor and into the room was burning my eyes and nose and I couldnt sleep. They changed my room to the 4th floor behind the elevator and it was better regarding cigarette smoke but for the price I paid per night for the room the room was not worth it.
20,Let’s begin with a positive. Quick and friendly checkin when we arrived. Luxor resort not as clean as we experienced at other casinos we visited on our stay. Main issue was the parking. Paid for parking with understanding that it would be good for other MGM resorts throughout our stay. Yes we could park at other resorts but key never worked for entire trip to enter or exit any of the parking areas not even the Luxor that we were paying guests. We wasted a lot of time trying to rectify the situation with the front desk. However not even the manager that we spoke with helped to fix the problem. I had to continually share my name and room number in the public parking areas for all to hear. Some people may say big deal to that but a past experience with a beak in to a hotel room was blamed on us sharing our name and room number publically(not at this resort). Unfortunately this makes me very uncomfortable having to share this info again and again. Of course the manager believe her name was spelled Ashlee at the Luxor acted as if this parking issue was not a big deal. After we had our keyed changed several times we gave up. We were tired of eating our time. We have had a lot of success at other resorts in Las Vegas so I guess the Luxor (and other MGM resorts must not want our business).
30,Ive traveled to Las Vegas many times and loved staying at Luxor but its been years since I last visited and our room was pretty low quality with a missing mini fridge flickering lights and some lights that didn’t even work. I don’t remember the quality of the rooms being that bad. A bit disappointing but the food especially at the Diablo’s Cantina was still as amazing as I remembered! Great staff managing both the Cantina and the Bar as well!
50,Great Service by Great People.  Right after the reopening the resort was kind of dusty but understandable we stay at Luxor at least every 2 months now looks cleaner and organized  Thank you Luxor for your hospitality
30,Food court was 30 minutes late opening up and service was rude  all together its a little out dated  and the people behind the desk are absolutely clueless on what's going on..never got a call from them when room was ready and also had my father's name mixed up with mine just a mess
50,A great place to stay gamble & eat!!! Would definitely return here!!! I wish there were refrigerators in the room but overall very comfortable except for my mattress! The location is perfect for me ! Close to everything!!!
30,The Luxor is just fine if you’re going to Las Vegas. It’s at the South end so a hike to the majority of the other places on the strip. There is a tram that connects it to the Excalibur and Mandalay Bay. The food options are fine but nothing special. The slot and table options are fine (limits aren’t as low as what you can find nearby at The Trop). The room was clean and had the basics. The in-room safe feature is convenient in the bedside table. The staff are polite if not necessarily friendly/welcoming. The mobile app was easy to use for checking in and out. The elevators have seen better days. Their incline keeps them from moving fast but they eventually get you there. As an overall option it’s nothing special but it does the job.
10,Nothing is new in the hotel. The theme is good and nice but the hotel lacks everything. Rooms were dusty we had a suite with a spa but it was a hepatitis spa in actuality since it was never disinfected…
10,Cleanliness and careful care of the room is very sub par. Ensure upon check in you thoroughly look at your room. I had hair from previous guest in my sheets pillows the shower had hair and the shower drain flooded the bathroom. The guest service rapport lacks and it so many guest that it is difficult for them to really care forr your concerns. I do not recommend this hotel.
20,Plenty of better options that don’t charge hidden fees for amenities that are closed. Elevators were only semi-operable and room keys were finicky trying to get on the elevator. Cool place to stay though.
40,Easy access from parking garage to front desk to elevator to room  Love the backstage Deli  Just relaxed in room for a two night stay  Centrally located by the main strip  Enjoyed our time  Would recommend
40,Our room was clean. The maid nust have knocked the plug out of the t.v so a staff member had to come up and find the issue.  Our shower would not drain properly. So we had to wait an hour between showers. Our pillows were hard and probably old. Overall not a big deal and we were just fine.
50,Great pillows great staff Clean check in line was very long had fun Will recommend to friends elavator could use some service all around great time I will visit again send coupons and tram system was awesome
20,Rude check in staff will tell you extended check out but wont follow through. You’ll be treated poorly if you don’t look “rich” (after staying I have no idea why anyone rich would even stay there). The rooms say “upgraded” but are subpar. Yes it’s cheap to stay but there are many other hotels def worth the small extra price. The casino has an extremely weird vibe and the machines are SO cold.
50,Room was nice and clean most of the staff was very friendly and we were helped quickly with our toilet not flushing and accommodated for the problem without asking for anything we received 100 in credit to use towards food or drinks
50,Silvia at the front desk was awesome the room was spacious very quiet and very clean. Breakfast at the pyramid cafe was great everyday and the staff at the cafe were great kept the coffee flowing in fact all staff were great
30,Outdated rooms no usb ports no microwave & no refrigerator. Room was clean but furniture was old. The lobby & casino areas were nice. This casino was on my bucket list for years however the room brought me down. I didn't have wifi access for 1 night
10,No Clock radio in the room Ceilings are outdated with acoustic spray texture. Toilets were mini. Beds were good however. Very noisy when trying to sleep. Staff is okay very helpful when asking for directions
40,The location was perfect for Mandalay Convention. Terrific value and very comfortable accommodations. Easy access to the Vegas strip and all of the best restaurants and shows in the area. Would recommend the Luxor and will plan on staying again when I return.
20,They did not fix cooling/heating issues. Called a number of times to front desk. They sent techs out and still couldn’t fix. So we had no sleep due to the climate in the room. They did not offer any accommodations or to relocate room. I will not stay there ever again.
10,This property needs a gut renovation. It is tired and old and the wifi doesn't work properly. They should just get going and fix it. One of the members of our group stepped on a cockroqch in their bathroom
50,All was good until we went to Bucca's. Food was terrible for the family. Service was bad they where under staffed. I've been in culinary 30+ years and you need to take better care of your guest. It took 30 minutes to get a drink. We always will come back but fix the problems!!
10,This room was disgusting old mold in shower. I had no running water for hours. No notice at all that the water will be shot down. This was the worst hotel room by far. I wouldn’t let my dog stay in a room like that.
20,Poor to terrible service. Different prices for the same room within a conference event that changes daily. I overpaid in a hotel with old rooms moldy showers etc. I would expect more from an organization like this. The Luxor is borderline dive.
30,First time staying here as we just wanted a much needed getaway. Upon arrival the appearance was good overall. The rewards room checkin rep wasn't very pleasant and had no personality. I guess because we got in the wrong line so we were were nobody's to him. After a long wait in line for checkin in we get to the room and it clearly states non smoking however it smelled like someone had just lit up prior to us walking in. The room was average and the bed was trash! So uncomfortable. We had a tower room. Casino was decent as far as layout and the location was as well. Doubt that we would choose to stay here again. Definitely a one and done but to each their own.
40,Only complaint is there are no refrigerators or microwaves in the rooms. Not having a refrigerator in the room or a microwave. Made it hard to put the leftover food to save for later. Also the in room dining in early even on the weekend.
50,We had a great experience with all phases of the Luxor! From the moment we checked in at the front desk throughout our 6 days and at check out everyone was so kind and courtious. Rooms were clean and well kept. (and our bed and pillows were very comfortable) We didn't have any noise issues. (and I'm a light sleeper) The casino had a good vibe to it. The shops were very helpful. And the restaurants were good!
10,Very disappointing to find out there’s no security cameras to record the thieves the broke into my room and stole medicine bags and shoes my first time staying there and last especially when you have kids
50,Loved my stay at the Luxor. The rooms are clean and comfortable and there is everything you need for an enjoyable stay. It also smelled wonderful when you walk through the front doors. And the turkey club at the Backstage Deli was fantastic.
10,We upgraded to a suite and it was a very old room (80s furniture) smelled like weed I had to rewash all my clothes after I came home. Check in process was very long only 2 people assisting at least 30 guests. They also were not friendly with us.
10,Hookers and loud music next door to me. Luxor would not help after pleading with them. Kept telling me security would come but they never did. Walls are paper thin. Rooms are not great and no coffee maker in rooms. Poor iron and ironing board. Never again!
10,The lady at the service counter was very rude and short with me. I had to stand line for over 30 minutes before I could check in. The room was gross and not clean and smelled like smoke. The bathroom was not clean. The towels smelled of smoke. I could not tell if they were dirty of just porley washed. There was not a refrigerator but there was a note where the refrigerator should be saying that you could rent one for 25 dollars a night. So you pay a resort fee and a refrigerator rental fee on top of that. This place is a joke. The bedding looked as it had already been slept on. Guest serviced never answered when I called about the room smelling like smoke and the room being dirty. Charged for a resort fee when I used nothing on the resort. Checked in after 9pm and left at 4am. How is that fair. I will never tell anyone to stay at the place it was an awful experience. I should have slept in thr Airport.    I was stuck in a room that smelled of smoke and cigarettes and dirty bedding. The air did not work. No one answered the phone at the front desk. By being so exhausted I was stuck in sleep in a chair what seem to be cleaner than the bed.
50,From check in to leaving I had a great time. The luxor was near what I wanted to see and do check in was fast nice big room and great things to see and che k out. Played some games dra k some adult beverages and ate some good food
10,Hotel is in dire need of maintenance. There are broken tiles the elevators are dinged scratched and stained. The furniture in the room looks old and stained. The table in my room looked like it was heavily used for at least 50 years. There was no way to put you shampoo and soap in the shower. Seriously? You have to put in on the shower floor? Even motel 6 has something for you to put you soap and shower. The ink water smelled like sewage not exaggerating. The food was OK at best and extremely overpriced.
10,I’d most likely not to book the same one again due to WiFi is so poor and the vent is making noise very bad at night. I don’t believe this should be a 3.5 stars casino standards for their guest. I had mentioned this to front desk personnel
30,Overall the property feels a bit tired and it is extremely confusing to navigate at first. The food is OK but there are limited options especially at lunch. The fitness center was great but was out of towels on day 2.
10,Construction vehicles right outside my window beeping relentlessly at 5 30am; elevators broken; NO internet service; Total Joke of a stay... and.. waited 18 min for a cab to the airport. Dismal stay all around and the staff just apologized but did nothing. The stay was not worth FREE... have NO idea why they would not care so much but I'd not ever staybthere again.
10,The smell of raw sewage permeates different parts of the casino and some elevator shafts. The amenities consisted of 1 shampoo 1lotion and 1 bar of soap. The coupon we booked the room for wasn’t even honored!
40,The updated rooms were really nice The only issue is the check in with digital key. if you lose wifi your digital key no longer works and you have to walk all the way back to the lobby to print a new key
10,My husband my parents and my infant daughter stayed in 2 rooms one night before a flight last week. Good price and good location but water did not work at all heat did not work (room 55 degrees when we woke up) and staff unfriendly.
50,Easy trip for us. Now that the cab company's offer a flat rate to the strip it was much easier to travel to the hotel. Didn't have to find the Lyft area wait for the car etc... Hotel check-in was easy. Only waited maybe for 5 min. Check-out easy also. Room very clean and quiet. Great restaurant/bar choices. Easy access to hotels Mandalay Bay and Excalibur without going outdoors since it was kind of windy and cool during our stay. Casino nice and spacious with alot of games to play. Would stay again.
50,Second time here for birthday celebrations loved how spacious and clean the rooms are also the convenience of the location only few minutes from the airport and right on the strip with a stop for the Big Red Bus just across.
10,Got here and had to spend weekend in ER due to mold in the room. Got back around 10pm the next day only to have a second reaction after being in the room for just a few minutes. When I called the front desk and told them they did not care and said “well you could leave”. Lmao. Okay so after the ER visit hospital transfer via ambulance and SECOND reaction when returning to the hotel—Luxor is a JOKE and the “manager” we spoke to disnt even respond to us just passed us on to a front desk person that asked us what his problem was that night. No one wanted to help us or see the pics of the mold/mildew that nearly caused a death. A near intubation. Let that settle in your brains please because this place does NOT CARE ABOUT THEIR GUESTS. Absolutely horrible stay and will always recommend people to stay literally anywhere else. I HOPE someone has enough empathy to reach out and attempt to resolve this as even when we tried staying loyal to the MGM brand and moved over to Vdara with absolutely no help from any employees they also seemed not to care and just wanted the money for a very expensive walk-in room. Tried explaining situation and it being so late and experiencing a horrible time because of Luxor… again the brand just does not care about their loyal members who try yet agin to have a good time. Just wanted to breathe so we went to the non-smoking hotel. At least we got a free mini bottle of water i guess. Even the Vdara room wasnt clean bro like hair in the sink and tub and something spilled all over the closet door. HORRIBLE.
30,Reserved a room in the pyramid with a shower chair they no longer have shower chairs only handicapped rooms in the tower and I was switched and upon arrival I could not get my room back that I originally reserved because it was given away and I was stuck in the tower and the bed was extremely uncomfortable inside of that Tower was a very long walk I had to rent a scooter for mobility accessible because it was such a far walk
50,I had wanted to stay at Luxor for many years. Finally made it to vegas and got a midweek deal at a great price.  The restaurants were excellent seeral great shows to choose from. The enclosed shopping arcades between the hotels are really fun to wxplore too.  Thebest part was the room. The angled walls are super cool and give fantastic views. Just outside your door a balcony overlooks the interior of the hotal. Large rooms with great bathrooms huge safes comfortable beds and spotlessly clean.  Highly recommend staying here.
50,The Luxor was much better than expected. We were upgraded to a tower room which was great. I loved that it was so easy to get around. There was easy access to our friends in the resorts close to us. Food was good and the rooms clean!
30,A classic hotel but needs some TLC in many areas. Corporate needs to put some money into this property in many areas to make it look presentable. Rooms elevators lobby halls casino common areas need to be fixed or updated.
10,You get what you pay for. I think MGM is tearing this place down soon so beware elevators will take a while since half of them are broken. Room was very dusty. It was a decent price which is why I stayed here but I will try another place next time. Water pressure in the bathroom was solid but at the $30/day spa it was pretty weak in the shower and below expectations.
10,Horrible room smells like dead animals. Try to give me different room even worse food smells. I would not recommend stay here. I checked in and went back to front desk explain them situation. They offer me different room after speaking with management. However room was worse than where I was. They came and spray air fresheners stilll smells in hallway and room.
10,The hotel was substandard. Our bathroom sink was clogged the entire time no amenities we had to rent a refrigerator if we wanted one. Not even a glass to use. The elevator barely closed completely and looked all beat up railings in hallways were missing chunks from them. Someone was climbing from a rope outside our window. The hallway was slanted like it might collapse. The diner was closed the entire time. Construction was going on below our room and not disclosed beforehand. Trash bags left on my clothes in my suitcase!
40,Great hotel but the cleanliness of the hotel bathrooms are horrible. Even the housekeeper said the bathroom wasn’t cleaned right. I’ll stay again no problem next time. I love the hotel and how beautiful it is.
40,I stayed for a layover. The staff was very friendly the room was clean and spacious and the location was very good and close to the airport. The price was excellent! It was a bargain. I would stay there again.
20,Never again it was terrible. There was a horrible smell coming from the sink. I couldn’t sleep due to the smell and there was also a leak in the room. My shower was out dated. I was very unhappy with my stay.
10,Got ripped off by my family friend that booked the same room same day got for $99 but the time we were done it cost me almost $400 WTF bed sucked no fitted sheets only flat sheets so they were all tangled up all night shower door was rotting on the bottom it just sucked all around
40,Hotel was ok but the room did not have a refrigerator looks like they removed it from the room. Bed was comfortable overall it is a good clean place to stay. The casino floor is very mellow I’m pretty sure it’s due to the location of the hotel being at the beginning of the strip.
30,Room was not clean. There was a very large amount of hair the size of a cantalope left in the bathroom waste container. We did not have water during our second night there. Carrot Top show was cancelled.
20,Same mediocre experience. Customer service is horrible and rewards offers aren’t that great. I will and stay somewhere else next time. The rewards program is not near as good as it sounds. We always have a big group and they aren’t accommodating at all in trying to get rooms close together.
50,This was a nice first Vegas experience. I wish you had a bit different games for tables but you had a bunch of nice ones nonetheless. I liked the Luxor interior and the design. The staff was friendly and welcoming.
30,After a long day of fun you want a clean place to rest. Dirty sheets affected the trip. There was a second bed that I ended up sleeping on but I wasn't comfortable going in the sheets. I try not to be a bother but I'll probably call for new sheets next time.
40,My first time staying at the Luxor and it was very pleasant. Rooms were clean and the staff was friendly. There is lots to do and eat right at the resort and close by. Connecting indoor breezeways let you travel to other hotels as well without going outside. Very convenient location to experience everything on the strip.
20,One elevator... Room in the other corner. So much walking just to go get coffee. So much walking to get anywhere in the luxor do not recommend. Food expensive pain to get anywhere. Would give it 2 starts
10,Don't get the jacuzzi room at the luxor cause you may check in to a public hair and sperm infested tub. The rooms are dirty and the walk from self parking is to long to check in. The manager is useless
20,I loved the hotel as it was very unique. The shows were okay. My biggest issue is the staff didn’t notify me that the water would be shut off from 12-4 and that caused a lot of issues for me and my service dog.
20,The room smelled bad like a musty oder and cigarette smoke that seeps in the room blood on our pillowcases dirty sheets. Elevators were in not the greatest shape. Food in at the buffet was horrible to the fact they refunded us our money back as soon as we saw it. Not a great experience for my 1st time.
50,We really enjoyed staying at the Luxor Resort. The staff was friendly price was great and the resort stayed clean. I would suggest anyone that’s looking for a place to stay in Las Vegas to check out the Luxor. You won’t be sorry.
50,I’ve heard many say to not stay at the Luxor. It’s one of the older hotels. Incorrect! For the price you can’t beat it. The hotel is always clean everyone is willing to help theming is great. Nothing negative to say 5th time on the strip 3rd time at the Luxor.
40,Good place to stay. Rooms are always clean and if you need anything housekeeping is always there and super friendly. The only bad thing is that their digital key system barely works cause you get far enough in you lose service
10,Don’t recommend at all. Great themed hotel ruined by being old and run down. We had an issue on the inclinator (elevator that goes up at 39 degree angle). It abruptly stopped halfway up to our room on the 12th floor causing my wife to fall into me. Room was old ceiling chipping bed uncomfortable old AC system that one would expect to see in a cheap motel. The list goes on and on. The only positive thing was the Starbucks at registration where I could use my mobile app to order a coffee and breakfast. Will never ever go back.
20,Bath tub was dirty. One of the rooms smell like poop. Pillow smell like sweat.  Prince is mot bad but for a little more money you can get a better place. I definitely do not recommend you to stay at this place.
50,Hotel was in a great location and had lots to do onsite. Friendly staff that was very helpful. Easy access to many other casinos entertainment and restaurants. Put your walking shoes Vegas has lots to see!
50,Everything was nice in order the food was great every time I come to Vegas I always stay at the Luxor Hotel I like the friendliness and the different type of foods in the atmosphere you can come and really meet some new people from other cities and counties
10,Apparently the heat and hot water was not work for one full day and we had no notice the room was ice cold and we had no hot water the maintenance man told yes it was because the plant was out. The hotel didn’t give us notice and when I called they played stupid I asked to change rooms or get a discount NOTHING. I WILL NOT STAY HERE AGAIN.
50,Everything about the hotel was exceptional. My daughter and I had a great time from customer service to spa all the way to maintenence  Thank you so much we will definitely come back soon especially for that spa.
40,Hotel great. Staff values their customers. Every member we came in contact with or observed very friendly.?Many choices to eat and many more with adjoining Excalibur Hotel. The Luxor was very clean in every area. Needs more elevators !
20,I upgraded to a room and paid for the upgrade and the room for a wedding to a suite and I checked in the room smell like smoke and mildew  and it had ants crawling around the shower  the upgrade was a waste of money  then they switch me to another one it had no heat  We had to sleep in the cold for our last night I pay extra for a suite for it to be dirty for both rooms
40,Overall the hotel was filled with good vibes clean and plenty of entertainment. I did not have to leave the hotel at all. The exhibits shows and food court were easily accessible! All of the attractions could be purchased conveniently by a mobile device or box office.
40,"Checking in at the Luxor was not the best part of the experience for us. We arrived early and wanted to get checked in and request early access to our room. Since we booked through a third party we used Expedia the desk was not able to help us. We were told we could self-check in but that app did not work properly. We went back up to the desk and she asked her manager to assist but he couldn't figure it out either. She did say that she would call us when the room became ready and we went off to drop our luggage at the bell hop desk. We didn't have to wait long because she called us at 10:30 to say we could pick up our room key at the desk. We were in our room by 11 am which was awesome since check-in isn't normally until 3 pm. The room itself was clean but sort of felt ""tired."" Underneath the air conditioner/heater was bare concrete and the cabinet that normally housed the small in-room refrigerator was just a big empty space with a cord hanging inside it. The bathroom was clean the shower was also clean and all fixtures seemed in good condition. The toilet seat did not stay up when raised and was so low that it was difficult to get up from seated position. They only supplied 1 small bar of soap which required us to transfer it back and forth repeatedly from sink to shower. Otherwise the people we encountered from the desk staff to the bellhop to all the workers in the casino and food or shops all seemed pleasant and helpful. The drinks at the Cetra lounge were great as well as reasonably priced. The cocktail server treated us very well. The food we had operated by the Luxor from the buffet the Pyramid Cafe and the Backstage Deli all were surprisingly good-well prepared. The pricing for most of the food options here were pricey by normal standards but by Vegas Strip standards not too bad. The convenience made it worthwhile. We also saw the America's Got Talent show in the Luxor theater and enjoyed it quite a bit. Even if you're not a fan of the show it would be a worthwhile experience as well. Signage to find your way on the cassino floor could be better but they do have employees available to help direct you if needed. We really liked having a designated Uber pick-up/drop-off location taking the guesswork out of where to schedule your ride to get you around Vegas. The ckeck-out process is made simple with a key drop box at the elevators and you simply scan a QR code and let them know you're checking out. We stayed in the Pyramid part of the original hotel but did not see the newer tower rooms so couldn't speak to any comparisons between the two. The online info we saw stated that they had not made any updates to the rooms in the Pyramid part and we could not find any info stating when this may take place. Still we thoroughly enjoyed the Luxor overall and would not find it difficult to choose to stay there again."
30,Pros: location.    Cons: far walk from elevator to room. Bathroom had mold and a crumbling bathroom door. Housekeeping didn’t clean or restock our room for 3 days. Timeshare type sales people bombarded us as soon as we tried to approach the check in desk and delayed our check in with their slimmy sales pitch when all we wanted to do after a long flight was check in and go to our room. lacked the food options of those hotels around it.
50,All the doors face the interior of the casino so it was very loud BUT I figured out that by turning the fan on for the htg/ac unit that solved the problem. The rooms bed pillows sheets were great!
30,Quick get away for hubby and I 2 nights. We took SWA up on their vacation deal. We usually stay at the Bellagio or Aria. This one is less expensive and you get what you pay for! Noisy rooms! :(  The Mexican rest. is good. We saw the AGT Allstars show and that was a waste of $. We saw the Bodies exhibit and enjoyed that. Casino was decent. We will try a different hotel next time.
50,We had a wonderful time at the Luxor. The room was spacious being larger than the average hotel room. Our room had an adjoining door. That was the only downside as we could hear our next door neighbor’s conversations. I’m sure the door was the sole reason for  hearing him. If you stay at the Luxor request a room without an adjoining door.
10,Falsely advertised incredibly rundown so many safety issues. Key readers at elevators malfunctioned trapped inside of elevators many times during stay. No maintenance or house keeping done on the property. Peoples throw up left on elevators and hallways. So many other safety violations that I don’t have enough time and space to write. Horrible place.
40,The room I had was dated. I think there were undated rooms but it was not offered at checkin. It's nice that the resorts had linked hallways so you didn't have to go outside to get to the next resort.
40,Affordable hotel prices close to the Las Vegas strip walking distance of many entertainment options. Luxor has friendly customer service. Digital room key and mobile check out are fast and easy to use.
50,Fun excellent would stay here again. Staff was great along with the atmosphere of the Luxor hotel itself.    The rooms were clean and unique. After all this is one of the original hotels on the strip.    I highly recommend seeing the Carrot top show. Hilarious.    Overall i would recommend to friends and family.
40,Vegas baby It was electric I had such a good time The shrine game was at the hotel right across from allegiance stadium Hot venue h*** of a stadium The Super Bowl was definitely back in 2024 Las Vegas Nevada Super Bowl Vegas baby
10,No amenities (no bottled water no coffee in room)problem with check in on hotel app getting room cleaned was a problem pipe burst so no water for several hours. Better stay at budget hotel! When I complained the staff basically called me a liar.
10,Flight was delayed and charged $200 for now show fees after we were told it was going to be okay. Luxor downgraded our room & check-in employees were ridiculously rude including Mangrs Bianca and Garrett.
50,I would stay at the Luxor again in a heartbeat it was in a nice location and the casino and resort were great. We really liked the having the three casinos connected it made for safe travel late at night to different casinos.
50,Great hotel. It’s on the end of the strip and still walking distance for everything. Very clean and ALL THE STAFF were all so helpful. It was affordable abd I ended up signing up for the rewards program for exclusive deals!
50,I highly recommend the Luxor. Sizable and very nice rooms and close to the action but yet positioned at the edge of the strip. Also close to the famous Bootleggers Italian restaurant which may have the best in town with entertainment. I highly recommend the Luxor
50,I love the way the hotel looks and feels. My go to place to get some rest whenever I’m in Las Vegas. I’d highly recommend to anyone who is either interested in gambling or the hospitality side of Las Vegas.
40,Stand in the priority line. Anybody can stand there if the line is long. I recommend staying here. The staff is friendly and the Tower rooms are so much better in person. It was better than expected. I like this hotel
20,Stool on the sheets!!!!! When we arrived we pulled the sheets back ( I do this everytime I travel). To my surprise there was stool YES poop on two different areas of the sheets!!! Unexceptable! I will not stay here again!
50,If you are looking to experience the strip Luxor is definitely a great place. It’s at the beginning of one end which affords you the opportunity to travel down the strip and not miss anything. Purchased a three day transit card and the bus stops outside of the hotel. Great place. Good atmosphere
50,We usually stay at Caesar properties but MGM has started sending us offers that we couldn’t refuse. We booked a room at Luxor and was pleasantly surprised. We were in the West tower. Rooms were spacious and comfortable. You can adjust the room temp to your liking (meaning they don’t have it blocked from going below 68 degrees-unlike many of Caesar’s properties). Bathrooms are very nice. The only bad things are there is not a refrigerator and you can hear stuff going on outside the room.  MGM properties have a monorail that is free that takes you to their properties. This really came in handy for us.  Give this place and other MGM  Properties a chance. You won’t be disappointed.
40,Property was good but a bit dated. Plenty of restaurants gaming and shows. Location is south strip which we enjoyed and it's close to the deuce bus stop plus there's a free tram to Excalibur and Mandalay bay. Bed was very comfortable. Big clean rooms and great price we would not hesitate to stay again
20,When we checked in me and my friend were at two separate tower’s because they changed her without a reason so I had to switch mine to the pyramid tower and we wanted to stay in the towers. When we checked out at the desk we found out the next day that we never got checked out so we had to check out on the mobile app. At least we never got charged for late checkout. When gambling we hardly ever saw a waitress so we had to go to the shop and buy our drinks. Shouldn’t have to pay for a soda or water when gambling and already spending money. And if u eat at public house. You will hardly see your waitress
40,I read a lot of bad reviews of the Luxor and I was expecting the worst however I was pleasantly surprised. We stayed in the tower. The room was clean and not run down. I liked the bathroom arrangement. Everything worked TV hot water  as it should. The hallway is a bit noisy when people walk thru talking loudly. I don't think anyone was in the room next to us at least not that I could tell. The bed was a little too soft for me but not terrible. My only issue was the drinking glass in our room had a bunch of Vaseline on the rim hidden under the paper sanitary lid. I didn't say anything as I didn't find it until our last night. Overall I had a great stay. The Spa was nice the buffet was good. I would totally stay here again.
10,Our mobile check-in created an instant unknown charge on top of having the incorrect reservation information despite verifying in the confirmation email that it was correct. You're charged daily (not up front) for resort fees parking is $28 a day whether you're a guest or not. Our thermostat was broken and took multiple workers over an hour to fix it while they tore the entire unit apart in our room. We called for extra pillows our first night there and went to bed after waiting over an hour. At 1:15AM we were awakened from a dead sleep in the dark to a male worker having let himself into our room stating he had extra pillows that we called for. There was 1 elevator for the first 6 floors and one for the other 9 floors that you had to wait over 20 minutes every time for the stairs are emergency exits only. During our stay one of the elevators broke two different times while full of people. The inside was absolutely beautiful but the floors to the rooms were lined with stained carpet and broken plaster and it costs $30 a day to rent a refrigerator to ensure you're spending money on food at their property. You also do not get to earn rewards points if you book your stay through a third party website which is awful considering they get the money either way and you're spending hundreds more at their property while there. It was so disappointing for our first time to Vegas.
10,"Our plane was delayed a day and we were charged $200 for a ""no show"" after we called and notified the hotel. We were told if we checked in the next day it would be waived. The fees were still charged & Staff is rude."
20,My room's heating wasn't working and staff told me there was no solution for the problem. I ended up having to request extra blankets for my weekend stay. I would've expected for someone to fix the heating or even offer to switch me rooms. The front desk just seemed like they didn't and couldn't be bothered.
30,Wasn’t impressed with the hotel for the price of everything. The location of the hotel was awesome. Saw prostitutes in the bar down stairs harassing customers and workers didn’t seem to mind at all. Thanks
10,I had multiple problems and dissatisfactions at my stay at the Luxor recently. First the check-in process was a nightmare. I booked my room using the MGM Resorts app and upon arrival at the airport at 7:30 a.m. the 1st day of my stay I use the app to check into my room to get a digital key. The oven for me that my digital key was not ready yet but it would be available shortly. So I spent another couple of hours getting something to eat and making my way over to the hotel from the airport and it still had not arrived. I paid the extra $20 for early check-in since my flight got in so early I needed to drop my luggage off at the room before attending a conference and when I arrived at the hotel I could not use my digital key at all and the looks or staff at the front desk was not helpful at all because they were telling me to check in on a Mobile kiosk after waiting in line for an hour and then I wasn't able to get an actual key or use my digital key and she told me that my room wouldn't be not ready until 3:00 p.m. even though I had paid for the early chicken so I was forced to take my baggage with me over to the Venetian Caesar's Expo forum for the SHOT show conference that I was in town for.    So after logging my bags into an Uber over to the conference finding somewhere to store them while I was there until 5:00 p.m. and then bringing my bags back to the Luxor to go to my room I then had to wait in line at the front desk again to actually speak to a front desk agent because the digital key on my phone would not work on the elevator so I had to go all the way back down and wait in line to get an actual key to even get to my room.    Then once I get to my room my bathroom was very dirty I've seen worse but I definitely expected better. My toilet had urine in it like someone had recently used it there was hair in my sink and in the shower and there was still trash in the trash can next to the toilet.    And to top everything all off my room was at the end corner of a hallway that was right next to a staircase door that apparently everyone on the floor used to go stand in the doorway of the staircase and smoke marijuana so that filtered under the door of my room so I got to smell that all night every night for my entire four night stay.    On one of my trips down to the lobby from my room upon exiting the elevator I saw one of the security Personnel in the yellow jackets so I politely went over and asked them if there was anything they could do about the people smoking marijuana right outside my door because it was filtering into my room and I really didn't appreciate it. And I was very sharply told that there is nothing that they could do about it because it's Nevada and it's legal even though I was under the impression that smoking in or around the guest rooms was not permitted. The lady looked at me like I was doing something wrong by complaining instead of the group of people standing outside my door smoking marijuana doing something wrong.    Then later on on my third night at the hotel I was at a roulette table playing for a few hours and not once but twice your roulette personnel that was working the table short paid me on a win one of the times was over $340 that they shorted me the second was about $160 that they shorted me. I had the sense of mind to catch the mistake and made it known and he redid his calculations and admitted that he had made an error and corrected it both times however it made everyone at the table uncomfortable that he was trying to short people and then it actually happened again to another lady for $75 and she didn't catch it so I spoke up and said something and he yelled at me and said you need to worry about your own money and stop encouraging everybody to complain. So I then called The Pit Boss over who was a older blonde white lady and she proceeded to scold me for the same thing telling me that if it wasn't my money I needed to mind my own business and if I had an issue I didn't need to talk to the guy running the roulette table I needed to call her over first. I was extremely angry at that response as I had done nothing wrong at the table except point out a mistake that your roulette Personnel had made and that they admitted to making after I caught it.    So to sum it up my experience with the Luxor Hotel and MGM and resorts in general was not favorable and I most definitely will think twice before picking an MGM location on my next trip to Vegas. I think Caesars will be the next one I try and that's unfortunate as I do love a few of your other properties as well but if this is the sort of experience I can expect I'm not in any hurry to experience it again.
50,I absolutely love this hotel perfect place for just about anything and everyone no matter the hours. I just wish there was a microwave in the room  but other than that I wouldn’t book anywhere else but the Luxor  close to the strip 24 hours places to eat or other choices within walking distance  staff is very friendly and informational when needed 🫡😊
20,Not impressed with our stay. Rooms missing standard amenities such as fridge and microwave. Bed was very uncomfortable. Titanic exhibit was worth going to see. The ability to travel from Excalibur to the Luxor and to Mandalay Bay was handy.
50,I stay at Luxor 2-3 times a year out of my 3-5 trips I make to the city. Great location to stay you can easily travel up the strip from here using the tram. Plus I love the tables here and staff is very helpful for new players.
40,My stay was not the worst but not the best . I do appreciate the $75 dollar restaurant credit . But the staff really wasn’t friendly . The rooms were so run down . The food very over priced for the quality. The best part was the spa for sure . And how convenient it was to get to two different hotels . I do think they need a security guard standing at the elevators Especially for woman . A drunk man tried getting in a elevator with me and wasn’t even from the same hotel . Thank goodness a couple got in at that moment i mention no room key you can’t go up he starred at me than stepped out .
50,This was a quick trip before a business trip. The staff at the front desk was amazing! Very thoughtful and courteous. The room felt a bit outdated but for the price I really didn't mind. I wish I could have explored more of the hotel and hope to do so in the future!
30,Everything was pretty standard. Long line ups very busy place elevators were slow with lots out-of-servce.. not a ton of food options. Casino was really hard on my luck. Would probably not stay again
50,This was a great visit I had no issues and price was awesome! The room was clean and the check in via mobile was easy and quick Within walking distance of the NYNY and MGM also tram was awesome between Mandalay Bay and Excalibur.
50,we all had a great time and there was 8 of us for a 21 st. birthday. everyone in the casino was very helpful with directions. Every where we ate the food was so very good. The slot machines were spread out nicely never felt to close to someone.
50,Awesome The reception area were very helpful. The room was nice and tidy and clean all around. Everybody was super friendly. And the shows were awesome. America’s got talent was a really really nice show
30,Room for a lot of improvement. Room booked may not be what you get. Take sinuses medication they don't have that available. Keep your clothes on; housekeeping will just walk in without notice. The table crew are AWESOME
50,Great hôtel. The exposition of the Titanic is magic. The room are clean and confortable . A lot of people but still very calm . The people at the desk was very great . The bed was confortable. The hôtel was very clean
40,The hotel and rooms were very nice. Areas are clearly marked throughout the facility to allow for simple travel. The food and drinks were made well and in a quick fashion. My only gripe is with how poorly the elevators have been maintained. Broken buttons open panel and readers that would just glitch completely.
30,We have stayed at the Luxor many times but after this last visit I think we will try one of the other Mlife resorts. Our room was great but overall the casino was disappointing. I found it very smoky and extremely loud.
50,We had another great stay at the Luxor. Room was very clean and I love the shower (great pressure). Everything you need is inside the hotel or in the connect properties of Excalibur or Mandalay Bay. I love the breakfast at the Pyramid Cafe. Omelletes are awesome!
30,Was upgraded to a tower room. The room was just okay. No frills but the bed was comfortable and the sheets were clean!! The bathtub drained very slowly. Took over an hour.    The customer service within the hotel and casino was excellent!! Housecleaning was great! Had the brunch buffet and it was very good. Look forward to my next Vegas adventure.
50,The Luxor has spacious older rooms at an affordable price. It is the closest from the airport so the cab ride is short. The staff are super friendly. I ran out of time but when I come back I will try the spar.
20,Don't expect to have a top tier room no matter how much you pay. Apparently the towers are a better option and the towers were not good. Wallpaper was falling off the wall and the sink had a horrible smell to it. The only perk to this stay is that it's connected to Mandalay bay Excalibur and new York new York.
50,Had a great time. Definitely worth the value. Real close to Raiders Stadium. Easy access to Mandalay Bay. Easy Uber/Lyft access. The “Fantasy” show was amazing. I will definitely come back and stay here
20,Old rooms that are dirty. Beds are horrible. They don’t have fridge microwave or coffee makers. The paint was peeling off in the bathroom and it was just all around a rundown hotel room that we will not be going back to.
40,Great value At the Luxor. Close to every thing and a tram to take u to other hotels. West tower rooms were clean and nice. Good view out of our window of pyramid and Allegiant stadium. Convenient Starbucks locations!!
20,MGM has basically given up on this hotel. Very poorly maintained. Mop left in room. Hair in sink. Broken towel rack. Moldy shower. Broken tiles. Rate they quote is half of what you pay once you pay Resort fees and sept parking fees which are what valet should cost. Don’t stay here.
50,Great place to stay. The casino has a great range of games and sport book. It's a little further down the strip but the tram is convenient being able to go Mandalay Bay or excalibur. You have to go see Americas Got talent if they have shows during your stay. The shows are at the Luxor which is a bonus!
10,Then they sent a engineer the first time to fix my heathe said he fixed it and to give it about 30 minutes to heat upI left for about 2 hours to come back to the same cold roomsthen they move me to another room and I had the same problem this time they couldn't even fix the problemso they moved me again
20,Broken A/C in a corner suite. Dated rooms. Plugs so worn a phone charger wouldn’t even stay in the plug. Slots were the tightest I’ve seen in Vegas. No real with rewards with MGM rewards. Even the food court food was outrageously expensive.
10,Bad services room services s 0 stayed 5 days room didnot clean on daybam leving they cometo clean dont like to call every day yo askfor towells anf for somemone to come and clean room room s smell bad
20,I didn’t like this hotel at all. It smells and is really old in decor. I would not recommend it to anyone unless they were looking for somewhere just to to sleep without luxury. Restaurants food was overpriced and tasted awful
20,Hotel was out dated. Nothing special about this place. Staff is not helpful. Wait staff in restaurants are rude especially at the Public House. Will not be back at least not to this property. We had a leak from our ceiling in our room soaked our suitcase of clothes. Leak was fixed by a towel being placed in our room. Horrible service to say the least.
20,Stayed at this hotel. Elevator smelled like pee. Two things went missing from our room. Put the do not disturb sign to make sure nothing else goes missing from our room but cleaners still went inside of room and put do not disturb sign back inside the door handle in room.
50,loved staying in a pyramid the corner room was amazing the hot tub was awesome and it was nice being able to travel to the other hotels just need to fix you mechanical walk ways looked kind off trashy the way there just not working but hey that’s an easy fix
40,Hotel room was quiet and clean. It was not overly crowded. The wait to check in was a little long but overall it was a good stay. I would definitely recommend staying here. The only thing this place does not have is a night club.
50,My 4 day stay at the Luxor was very enjoyable.The casino had great ventilation smoke was not a problem it was well lit and not congested. I was easy to move about. My room was clean quiet modern and spacious. Self parking was quick and easy.
20,The rooms are very beat up (stucco flaking off electrical components not working couches so worn they have no cushion in some spots) and dated. They want to charge you extra for a fridge when most places give you a fridge. The elevators are a disaster (buttons not working doors broken absurd noises the list goes on). Hall carpets stained and rolled/stretched out.
20,We were near the elevator and could hear loud people in the middle of the night. Could even hear the guy next door sigh when he was urinating. The toilet wouldn't flush the toilet paper. There was big long dark hairs in the bathroom sink. The place is old and run down.
20,Bad service nothing was the accurate what they said. They need to help more and ask if people need help  Or explain what they going to charge and not get over charge of another amount that wasn’t said.
50,For the price probably the best hotel I've ever stayed in. The suite was huge. House keeping staff did a great job. Looking forward to my next trip to Las Vegas later this year. Would do it again and again.
50,It was just another excellent Vegas stay! Once again there were not any real issues of note at all with the stay! It was another smooth Vegas trip as I have begun to expect from any Vegas getaway! Outstanding!
40,This hotel was beautiful and the theme was very cool! We had a king suite with a tub by the window and it was awesome. My biggest complaint is the location. 10 min Uber to treasure island & Caesar’s palace.
40,Had a great time. Check in was easy rooms are clean and comfortable. Small little maintenance things need to be performed but over all great room. Luxor seems to have less food options than other hotels on the strip however you can find something if needed.
50,This was my first trip to Vegas and I couldnt be happier with the Luxor. Clean rooms great atmosphere and friendly staff. The restaurants are nice and the gambling was more relaxing than many of the other casinos we visited during our stay. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a nice/easy overall experience.
40,I enjoyed my stay. Idk wish they had at least a microwave in room. Rouge was a good show. Bagel spot in Excalibur was disgusting. Johnny rockets burger was good. Writing this essay for a review is annoying.
30,If the price is right stay. There's nothing to write home to mom about. Elevators ate in desperate need of attention. The casino is fine the environment is fine. The hotel is just a bit older. You won't be blown away and you likely won't hate it. It's in the middle
50,Great hotel for the value. Large very clean rooms. The staff were very helpful and friendly. Loved the location pretty easy walk to anything on the strip. We had a great time and we will be going back.
50,*Room was clean well maintained and recently renovated  *Common areas were clean. Many escalators and walkways were out of order but this seemed common throughout Vegas.  * Easily walk to Mandalay Bay or Excalibur without going outside. Close to MGM Grand and New York New York Hotels.  *Good was good in any or the hotels we ate at. Expensive but good.  *Monorail can be picked up at MGM Grand a bit of a walk but a good way to get yo north end of Strip.
30,Waiting on staff to let us out and waiting on the gate to be fix. Multiple times we had to wait for someone to let us out. They didn’t fix it and the car line got backed up a lot. It was the worst. And being charged for parking while staying there is something we shouldn’t have to do.
10,I explained in previous comments about the hard mattress the very dirty carpet with the large amount of dust in the corners of the carpet is very disgusting. The toilet wasn’t flushing properly every single time we used it the water had a terrible odor. Every time you wash your hands my daughter’s room a couple rooms down had a huge hole in the wall. It look like there was some kind of weak and they just left the cut sheet rock there on the floor. The whole was about 4’ x 18” and that was from the hallway to her room you could have possibly gain access if you wanted to.
40,The staff was great and the rooms were very nice but the property has some issues. The moving walkways between Luxor Excalibur and Mandalay Bay were not working throughout almost our entire stay. Many of the restaurants had limited hours of operation which caused us to go off property for many of our meals.
30,My stay was mostly good. I do wish my suite had a microwave and coffee pot to go with the fridge. The elevator system Was frustrating and I was hurt. When I reported my Injury I felt like it wasn’t their problem and they didn’t care. They did nothing but have me fill out a form
30,The service was great. The hotel is old and needs renovated and updated. The entertainment was non-existent. Hotel staff did a great job. This hotel was ok however I wouldn’t stay there again. No fridge or micowave in the rooms.
10,We was excited to get an opportunity to be able to stay at such an iconic lodging option in Vegas during a roughly (12-hour) layover in between flights. Wanted to to just get some rest at a nice room eat and play. Upon checking in the front desk was already confused with our hotel reservation stating that our check out was going to be 2-days more than what we booked (3-day in total apparently). What we actually booked was 1 night stay with paid late check out. We spent roughly 10-15 minutes about our booking our situation and why we booked it. The front desk finally “got it” gave us our key and we were on our way. Hotel room was okay needs some renovations but nothing too harsh to comment on. We dropped our bags in the room and went to get breakfast since we came in on a red-eye flight and did I mention that we checked in at 8:30-8:45am. We got breakfast and played in the casino for roughly 2 hours and decided it was time to nap and get ready for the next leg our flights. As soon as we got into the room we were almost immediately met with the sound of our hotel door and the card reader rejecting someone’s key. We opened the door to a confused couple insistent that we were staying in their room. We explained that we just checked in and we’re assigned this room. We called the front desk to square away this issue and the women in this couple went to the front desk. After waiting for what could have been 15-20 minutes on hold I talked with a front desk personnel and explained what was happening. We were told that they checked us out of hotel room apologized and “confirmed” that we were checked back in and saw notes about our late check-out. We felt a little relived until we got knocks on our door 15 minutes later and the couple is with security asking to check-in about our situation confirm our confirmation and even asked/ demanded us to go to the front desk to get this squared away since in everyone’s eyes we were illegally squatting and weren’t suppose to be there. They asked us to pack our stuff and get out basically. My husband grabbed our hotel confirmation card holder that had written notes that we were “confirmed” for late check out at 3pm and showed the security personnel as he and the security personnel made their way to the lobby. In the elevator security was dumbfounded that we had our confirmation with proof that we were paying guests had documentation and my husband explain our situation. Security almost instantly before getting to the front desk received confirmation that front desk had notes in our reservation and that we were “okayed” to continue our stay in room. At this point we felt violated accused of actions and put in a situation that could have been completely avoided had proper notes at check-in been made. When we checked out at 3pm my husband wanted to talk with the front desk to get an explanation and we’re basically told “we apologize but you’ll have to talk to the security manager to complain about this situation. Basically we paid to feel like criminals. Long story is that my husband and I will probably not be staying at this hotel moving forward with how unprofessional unorganized and the lack of communication and empathy their front staff/reservations and security had. We truly don’t make any complaints or feel the need to share bad lodging stays but this has been one of the worst experiences in our almost 15 years of travel together. Expect to have trouble if you select and pay for the late check options since communication is something that strongly needs to improve. I understand that things happen but with how the hotel staff handle this I was highly disappointed and frustrated and would have appreciated some compensation instead of given the run around.
30,"Hotel staff just walks i to your room without knocking. I was laying in my bed on the phone and with just my underwear on when someone from housekeeping or maintenence just walked right in. No apology or anything just an ""oops"" from him."
20,Rooms are out dated music playing outside room 24/7. Had to pay $18 day for parking $25 for a refrigerator. No hair dryer in room and room had a smell. Gym was nice and clean guest services was helpful as could be.
10,The staff was very unhelpful and at times very rude. It didn’t leave me with a yearning to return as so many places have in the past.  The rooms are forty miles away from any kind of entertainment. Of course no that far. But it certainly felt that way.  Zero room service after 1in the afternoon. Not sure how that would work for anyone.
30,The Hotel is very nice but the drink and food prices are extremely high compared to Fremont Street and the slots did not pay well. We took an Uber ride to downtown and enjoyed that much more. The Luxor does have a heavy cigarette smell to it for a non-smoker it was a turn off.
10,Waited 20-30 minutes for elevators. Even when an elevator showed up it was a high probability that you had to pass on it because it was full.. In the rooms there were holes in the sheet rock paint peeling from walls and carpet missing in room.. at least it was cheap to stay🤷‍♂️
10,Check in is always an adventure. Long wait lines and not enough staff.  Couldn't sleep on the old soft smelly mattress provided in the room.  Air conditioner was noisy and never really got the room to the temperature I would have liked.
10,Was suppose to be wonderful wedding experience turned into nightmare we had to extend our stay for 2 more nights do to a booked flight and we’re assured that’s what we had only to be locked out of our rooms and had to pay for another night
50,This was our first time staying at Luxor. Everything was great. The suite was the most amazing hotel room in which we have ever stayed. The service was superb. Everyone was friendly and professional! We will return.
50,We recently stayed at the Luxor and as always ir was fantastic!! It is our favorite place to stay on the strip staff is extremely friendly and the atmosphere was incredible. Also as always breakfast at Pyramid Cafe was incredible!!
50,Loved our week at Luxor. We do not normally go in the winter but threw a wee trip in to build our points to get to Gold again this year. Hotel stay was awesome super clean room and very friendly service.  Can’t wait to go back
10,Filthy room  mold in restroom  garbage u def the bed  coffee table glass had many cup rings with sticky juice everywhere  hair on pillows  large red stain on carpet and litle stains everywhere . The location of the room wasn’t that great  I love the towers  but this time we tried the pyramid and we’re very disappointed with the room  and the condition . It wasn’t cleaned and with covid it was very concerning .
30,This hotel is massive but that’s not a negative point the room we stayed in was beautiful. It was a 1 bedroom tower suite and well worth the extra money. I can’t fault the hotel in terms of cleanliness location etc. I have 2 negatives to take away.    1) Too many lurkers this isn’t the fault of the hotel as they can’t stop this from happening. Lurkers are people who hang around the machine waiting for you to lose so they can jump straight on your machine the moment you press the cash out button. They’re not discreet either they are blatantly watching you play the machine and you can see them getting more excited as your dollars are going down. However you can have some fun with it by pressing cash out and pretend to get up but then sit back down and put another $20 in….they don’t like that. Anyway too many of them and it does spoil your enjoyment in the casino a bit.    2) We were given a complimentary drinks voucher as we were celebrating my birthday during our stay which we thought was a very nice touch. The ticket said we were eligible for 2 free “champagne” drinks as we are both tee total we asked if we could exchange them for 2 soft drinks. We went to the flight bar inside the hotel and said we don’t drink and could we possibly exchange them for a sprite or Pepsi and the blonde haired lady behind the bar said no. She was so rude in her response and completely cut us off she said “it’s champagne or nothing” and that “they can’t be exchanged for anything else”. Now we understand the exchange policy if we were asking for different alcoholic drinks but we were literally asking for a sprite or Pepsi WHICH THEY GIVE FOR FREE WHEN PLAYING THE MACHINES AT THE BAR??? How does that make any sense??? Anyway that put a slight dampener on the birthday celebrations.    On the whole a lovely hotel but those 2 negatives do stick out when thinking of this hotel for us
10,the photos online are of the updated version of the rooms and not the 90s hellscape they had me check into.    The premiere king suite that was shown on the website which i paid handsomely for was not the clean updated room shown in the website. The room I was given was far outdated in every aspect besides the bedding. The tub in the room was littered with pubic hair. The new samsung tv was somehow configured to function as an early 2000s dvd main menu. I am disappointed in the quality of the room and lack of transparency - I have never been catfished in my life until I checked into this room.    I chose the luxor and splurged on the room as a romantic treat for my significant other’s birthday vacation. This definitely put a damper on the trip.
50,The hotel was very clean and staff was extremely friendly. Lots to do at the hotel and lots of good food (public house has the best loaded fries in the world). Lots of things within walking distance and easy access to be picked up by Lyft drivers.
50,This was an amazing time I enjoyed everything starting from the hospitality when I pulled Upton the check in process to the rooms and the food. The over all stay was nothing short of amazing I would definitely recommend this hotel to others.
10,The smell of the room and the water was enough for me to never stay here again. Not to mention the furnishings were awful and old and the refrigerator was rusty. My room had the big bathtub but unless you bring bleach and dawn to clean it yourself it’s unusable. Overall just spend $50 to $100 more a night and stay somewhere else.
50,Stayed for one night and found our room perfectly priced with the location we preferred. The spa and couples massage was exceptional and ambiance of the whole place suited us well. Most of all pet friendly!!!
30,I really think the staff is trying to make this a good experience but the Hotel itself is dated and not in very good condition. Room amenities are sub-par. No fridge no coffee pot. Even motel 6 has a damn coffee pot. If you want to gamble and take and escort to a room this place might be ok for that. If you want to actually relax in a nice room then maybe not.
30,Came to Vegas with 8 people and the Luxor was the best offer with mgm comps available at the front of the strip so it’s a walk everywhere Uber pick up and dropping off was convenient rooms a little dated and bathrooms could use a refresh
20,Way to much to type. To keep it short Rooms are horrible and dirty. First room I was assigned to had peoples belongings in them. Never again…. Told them I was pregnant and having slight contraction had my husband and I walk across the casino when rooms were available right next to the check in counter. Again never again….
40,Great location. This hotel has everything well cared for a tad musty in the halls. Only complaint is elevator buttons and key card access was consistently malfunctioning. Staff was great price was great.
50,We booked a trip to see Americas Got Talent which has a residence at the Luxor hotel. I am limited in mobility so decided to stay here for only one reason the proximity to the show. After reading some reviews I was a little hesitant and did not have high expectations for these accommodations. Boy was I pleasantly surprised! From check in to check out the people were great the room was nice (nothing fancy but we didn’t need fancy) the bed clean and comfortable and the service people were all very nice! The Luxor Cafe was great and our waitress Alecia was wonderful. My only complaint was they at night the Wi-Fi was not great as the TV kept going on and off but that’s it! If you are looking for luxury stay somewhere else. If you are looking for comfort and a pleasant place to stay gambleeat and see a show without costing an arm and a leg (besides your gambling of course) then this is a great place to stay!!! Would go again!
50,All of the staff made my stay special and went above and beyond without me having to ask. I also strongly recommend the spa. It was clean and a safe and comfortable atmosphere to really decompress in.
30,Room was dirty. Housekeeping not doing their job. Found dirty sock and bottled water in room from previous occupant upon check in. Housekeeping forgot to clean room one of the days. One of the pillows smelled of vomit and had a stagnant bad odor. Must have not been cleaned.
30,Overall good stayI had a leak in my room on the first day due to rain then I was upgraded. The staff is very friendly and the hotel is very clean. The buffet was really good and the chefs and staff were very friendly.
40,Rooms a bit dated but nice and good value for the money fun hotel good place on the strip valet and Uber pickup the best on the strip for ease of use also was the hotel that smelled the least of marijuana so they are on that in the Luxor
10,Had to eat cold food and drink warm drinks. There was no microwave or refrigerator in the room. And when I went downstairs to try and get some food warmed up they told me they wouldn’t be able to do that for me
30,This property needs a good scrubbing from the top down- like a lot of Vegas properties it’s starting to really show its ago. I have stayed at most of the major properties in Vegas and the Luxor did disappoint this time around.
50,Stayed a week and had a great experience. Clean room and friendly staff. Although an older hotel kept in good order. A mini fridge in the room would be a great addition but overall happy with the stay.
50,Luxor is beautiful! Our room quite large immaculate and enjoyable! Easy to get around the hotel. Starbucks is so busy but that’s expected! Check in was fast and accommodating. Slight early check in which was very much appreciated!  Would stay again!
40,Overall a great value based on location quality of the hotel and price. I was able to secure a regular rate room at the Luxor cheaper than discounted business and government rates elsewhere OFF the strip. For the money (about $75 a night) it couldn’t be beat.
20,Not enough value for the price. Elevators are scary and the layout of the property is frustrating. You can only access your floor from one bank of elevators so going to and from the room is a hassle. Facilities are run down. They alway timeshare scammers to rent a desk right up front to harass guests and the keycards are unreliable
40,Far enough away to be able to relax from expo stuff close enough to not be a problem getting to expo fairmont st experience... good stay. probably would stay again for future business travel. Tower rooms are more convenient and spacious than main building stay due to architechture but nice. Biggest convenience is access to excalibur and mandala bay through walking bridges.
10,Softball Tournament a College Showcase for my daughter . I was very uncomfortable staying there just the one night. I would not recommend bringing any young children or teenagers to The Luxor . Please be careful there especially in the elevator
10,"When my brother and I booked this hotel I was a bit skeptical as I heard some bad reviews but decided to put it past us since you never know what somebody's experience was. When we arrived to the hotel the gentleman at the desk was not very friendly. Check in was quick which was nice. We got into our room and the floors are so old and outdated and have stains all over it. The cleanliness was subpar. The location is not great if you are looking to go into the heart of the strip as it is at the complete end. We did not spend much time at the actual hotel besides sleeping. Our last night we decided to go to the flight bar and play a game and grab a drink. We cashed out and walked back towards our room (west tower) my brother ran outside and while he did that I waited for him in the lobby. After the lobby we went back up to our room. At this point I realized my wallet was missing. I tore apart my room thinking maybe I put it in a spot other than my purse. It was nowhere to be found. I went down to security and explained my last steps of the night and that I knew I had the wallet at the bar but believe it may have fallen out and most likely stolen as I had significant amount of cash in it and it was a higher end wallet. When I went to security the woman was rude and did not want to be bothered. She basically told me that it was my fault that I abandoned it and there's nothing they could do. I asked her if they could check security footage as I was flying back home that evening and needed my ID. She then told me that is not in her jurisdiction and nothing could be done. As my day went on I froze my debit card and hoped to hear from security but nothing was found. I was able to get on my flight and as I am sitting waiting for us to take off I received a notification from my credit card as well as my Venmo card that I was charged $1.34 ""PBC-Las Vegas"" at this point I was on a plane and not in possession of these cards whatsoever. I looked up the charge and it seems to be for a vending machine and there is another story of a woman losing her wallet at the Luxor and 3 hours later that charge happening. Overall the security and management of this hotel is a joke and its unprofessionalism like this that will ruin a business. Do not recommend!! Spend the extra money elsewhere."
10,Bed bugs all over me the next day. Had to go get ointments for treatment. Hookers propositioning me around my entry into my room. I just wasn’t comfortable entering and exiting my room. Very frustrating with the whole stay.
10,This hotel was dirty and very outdated. There was a hole in our window (on the 11th floor) that leaked a large puddle onto our carpet when it rained. Because there was a hole in the window we also were woken up by sirens in the morning. There are VERY few amenities. No coffee have to pay for a refrigerator and just overall an unkept hotel. The elevators take forever and the floors of the elevator waiting areas the elevator doors and walls were filthy. The hotel really needs a deep clean.
30,Rooms are stuck in the 90's. Tub was dirty when I got in the room as was the shower. Had to clean it myself. Walk from room to elevator was an additional 5 minutes. Wait for elevator is between 3-5 minutes. If you need to say somewhere cheap and don't care about the room itself go for it. If you're looking for somewhere nice this isn't the place for you.
50,Luxor is one of our favorite properties now for staying in Vegas. We come for the hockey games so it's fairly easy access via walking to the arena. The cost of staying at Luxor is far more affordable than other MGM properties. The newly renovated rooms in the pyramid are quite nice. The tower rooms and suites are getting dated but still quite nice especially for the price point. There's a buffet and great food onsite. There's also the shops along the way to Mandalay Bay with some food options there. Easy indoor walking to Excalibur and Mandalay Bay and the outdoor tram makes this a good spot. The tram can get you to the corner of Tropicana and Las Vegas Blvd. Easy access from there to NYNY Tropicana and MGM Grand.
10,There was no resolution and I was very disappointed. My stay was for 4 days and I checked out after just staying one day. I will never go back there horrible experience. Management was terrible in resolving the issue and provided no help.
50,I went to Luxor with low expectations but the hotel and casino definitely changed my mind. Ee had a great time and great food there nothing over the top but delicious and what we needed. Definitely will be back.
40,You get what you pay for!! I didn't pay much because of MGM rewards but I sure got my monies worth. Luxor was a great place to stay for the value and the attractions inside. Will definitely consider staying again!!
10,Got in from a late flight only to find our room didn't have a working toilet or cold water and the water was black! We were moved to another room and the entire bathroom was stained with some black ink and this was supposed to be a premium room but didn't feel like it at all! They gave us a $50 credit that we couldn't even use because all of the restaurants were closed overnight -_____-
20,No response from lost and found. My view from my room was a concrete wall. Noisy guests from 2:00-4:00 AM on multiple nights kept us awake. Shower corrosion made me think I was on the coast and not in the desert.
10,We booked on your site ( not 3rd party )  Spa room city view. We got 2nd floor No view. We asked if our family members can get same rooms. That showed available on YOUR SITE not 3rd party. And the staff declined.  Thank You Luxor MOTEL.
10,We checked into our room and the toilet seat was broken the tv didn't work and the iron didn't work either. We called the front desk and the person said someone would go up and fix it. I called the front desk three hours later since I was still waiting for someone to fix the issues. They told me to call back tomorrow because they were busy. I said this was unacceptable and asked to speak to a supervisor. A supervisor gave us a new room in the west tower. The room was filthy. There was trash on the carpet and there appeared to be blood stains on the bed sheets. It was late and I was too tired to call back. The next day I asked them to change the sheets and vacuum. They didn't change the sheets or vacuum we just got new towels so I had to call back again. When they did send someone up she smelled very strongly of marijuana. I know it's legal and I don't have an issue with it but I have a problem with her bringing the smell to my room not to mention her being high. It would be like smelling like alcohol it's legal but it doesn't mean you get drunk and go to work. That was just the room review. The casino and food court were so below average. It is one of those casinos that smells old dusty and smoky and you start getting headaches.
10,We were here in January 2023 so the weather was cool and outdoor pools were closed. In addition to the prepaid hotel fees we were charged $18 per day to park a car [and charged for 4 days even though I had the car for 2 and had to wait in line for 30 minutes to ask them to correct that] and $35 per day RESORT FEES. I asked what the resort fees covered and was told: the pool [closed for winter] free local calls [we all have cell phones no one uses a hotel phone for anything anymore] printing your plane boarding pass [again we have that on our phones or can print at the airport] oh and free wi-fi. I objected saying these so-called amenities might have been great in 1992 but are meaningless now. She said well you can use the fitness center. Yes because everyone goes to Vegas to use the fitness center. A piece of pizza in the food court was $15 a Bud was $15 at the food court and $9 in the bar. C'mon. All that was annoying but then I got in the elevator. The maintenance access door in one of the elevators was hanging by a hinge another was held on by a piece of tape another had wires hanging out and the 4th had no door and gang graffiti all over it. THIS is what they call a RESORT? I complained and asked the manager when was the last time he looked at the elevator. He said they regularly maintain it. I said I've been here since Wednesday and it's Saturday and no one has fixed those doors or cleaned those elevators. I was then told that they keep a nice hotel and that it's the guests who tear it up! The place reeks of cigarettes and cigars and to compensate when you walk into your room you are smacked with overwhelming air freshener. The room was ok but just a standard hotel room. This was my first time to Vegas. It was for my husband's birthday. He had great memories of Vegas and was really disappointed in the hotel. The thing is after getting fleeced that first night we never spent one dime in the hotel. We left every day and went down the strip to other places ate and drank and gambled elsewhere and only slept at the Luxor. Had they treated us better we might have stuck around. I would never recommend this place. It is NOT a resort and is at best a mediocre hotel. Go further down the strip where your business is better appreciated.
50,Check-in procedure was super simple - done right on my phone. No need for standing in lines. Room was ready early. Corner room was really nice and great view and very large room! Very happy with stay overall.
40,Like l said before the room smell like humidity  and cigarettes. Other than that we like staying at Luxor there are lots of bars restaurants stores and the staff is very friendly. You do have to pay for valet parking
50,MGM is the only properties I will stay at in Vegas. Live the food service and the rooms are always great . Always a good time in the casinos dealers and pit bosses are always helpful. Never had a bad time at any MGM property  .
40,Great value for a hotel on the strip. Rooms do not have microwaves or refrigerators but they were clean. Difficulty with the digital pass on my phone in the elevators was frustrating. Will not allow you to go to another floor.
50,We had a tremendous stay for my birthday trip. The front desk were super helpful & made us feel like VIPs. We loved everything about our stay at The Luxor! - King Pyramid Corner Room. Highly recommend!
10,Staff not friendly cursed at my wife. Parking garage gate didn't work well room smelled of pot shower did not properly drain causing it to overflow in minutes. Had to rent a refrigerator called multiple times to front desk who never answered.
40,My wife and I took our 17 year old daughter to Vegas for a softball tournament and stayed at the luxor and the last time I was in Vegas was 22 years ago for my 21st birthday and the Luxor was where I stayed and I loved it then and this time it did not disappoint either but being in Vegas with your 17 year old can be a little challenging In sin city.
20,Not the best place to stay. We got sick eating at the pyramid cafe. Friend and I both had steak for breakfast and let’s just say it was out before you know it. Rooms are overpriced for the quality. Will not visit again
10,Came for my nephew's hockey tournament. Stayed in the East Tower. Was charged over $200 a night for a room with no real amenities (no mini fridge one tiny bar of soap 1 tube of crappy lotion and 1 tube of crappy shampoo-conditioner combo)... found hairs in the tub that weren't mine grout peeling in the shower stall a stain on the wall and multiple places in the hallways where the wallpaper had peeled off due to water damage but either had not been replaced or was literally pinned to the wall with thumb tacks). Elevators didn't always register a key card swipe so you'd be stuck in elevator limbo. In short old gross overpriced and not well-maintained. Will not return.
30,Overall the hotel was ok but the hallways and rooms just not clean and housekeeping was not done so I’d never go barefoot even in our own hotel room. Staff was ok not overly helpful but not terrible. Staff in food court rude.
10,Would give 0 stars if I could!! We stayed here from December 19-26th. After returning from our holiday I found a $420 charge on my credit card. I called the hotel to inquire spoke to Carla she said she was the hotel manager. I was told the charge was for smoking in the hotel room. However neither myself or my boyfriend smoke. We were told the housekeeping supervisor had provided photos of ashes in the room as evidence. We requested the photos Carla refused to forward photos of ashes in the room and said unless court ordered they would not be showing us. We’re disappointed we’re left with charges that we aren’t accountable for. As stated we don’t smoke it is impossible for there to be ashes left in that room.
30,Not sure if Luxor is going down hill or if they were just off their game during this trip. My room was dirty hallway had a minor flood that got my shoes wet continually. But staff was helpful and kind.
50,The hotel is pretty cool in architecture and gaming access. Food was good. The rooms were clean and quiet. The entertainment area is lively with good floor directions good access to walk to other hotels nice staff.
50,I've been coming to Las Vegas for about 7 years for the same company trip. And every year we always book with Luxor. It's a nice distance from the Mandalay Bay Convention center without being too far. The staff is always super friendly and accomodating. We did switch up this year and go with a Tower Room normally we are in the Pyramid. The room was super nice but the bed and pillows were a bit soft for my liking. I do like that you need your room key for the elevator (for some reason made me feel a bit safer)
20,Be well aware there is no fridge (which can be rented for a nominal $20 extra per day on top of all the other fees). Also no coffee pot but there are 3 Starbucks on property that charge dbl because they can!
50,Luxor has great location or our football tourney. Rooms were good just wish the had fridge and microwave without extra charge. I love the shows food and services the hotel provides and also staff was great.
20,The Luxor has plenty of potential but MGM must spend a few dollars to update the rooms. Very outdated and dingy. The employees were very friendly and helpful. If the rooms and elevators would get a facelift this would be a great property.
30,Time to start applying the resort fees and high room rates to the upkeep and repairs of the aging property. The casino is a myriad of bad smells mostly that of marijuana. Definitely need to be running more than 2 Craps tables especially in a weekend. Had to go elsewhere to get some table time
30,The exterior entrance and lobby of Luxor are luxurious but not the casino hallways rooms or theater. The staff was very friendly but they did not clean our room but once during a 4 day stay. We had to reuse towels and also there was no conditioner provided in the shower. Overall I do recommend this hotel because I haven't found a nicer one for this price point. Egypt vibes are sweet. Wish they decorated the rooms like that.
50,Stayed at the Luxor for a Vegas wedding. Received such great service and went to the exhibits. Had such a fun time we extended our stay another night. On our final night we decided to visit the casino and we were more than surprised by the cleanliness and quick service provided by their staff.
50,The Luxor is a high end venue with reasonable rates for the rooms. It has everything you need right there. The rooms are very nice good size with nice mattress and large Samsung TV. There are good restaurants and a good food court that stays open late. The location is very good. It's close to Mandalay Bay  Excalibur and MGM. You can get a good deal on Priceline.com or Travelocity.com.
30,I would stay there again if i wanted some action but also wanted just a little quieter than some other places.    I didn’t care for Diablos but pyramid cafe and the back stage dinner were great. I did not check out the buffet. They need coke product and something better than Starbucks.
10,I booked a room with a hot tub for my husband and I only to find out that the tub had not been cleaned out from the previous guest! There was no room service available! The toilet leaked and it was a complete waste of money for what we got for a three day weekend!
30,An old hotel that needs major upgrades.  We moved twice before we accepted that the last move was the best we could get. Gnats musky bad drainage and old mattresses. At buffet gentleman that was making omelets great! How ever his job could be made easier by either labeling the assorted meats and veggies. He was asked by every guest what he were the choices. He repeated himself to every customer. A sign with choices would help make the line run smoother.
20,For been the hotel to be not in press with it.The bathroom floor dirty sticky. The sink not working. The elevators from parking structure to building not working. The elevators in the building some of them not working either. Issues to access the building had to pay every time i go in and my parking fee was included with my reservation fees and my key was still not working. Horrible hotel is not what i expected specially for been the type of hotel all nice and fancy.
20,Don’t bother. They charge $200 a night and my room literally had a mini fridge missing a bathroom w no fan and bathroom door with a 2-inch gap 10-year old tv etc. very poor quality. Skip it and find something else.
40,Grateful that vegas.com was able to cancel additional nights at RIO and secure the remaining 2 nights at Luxor. Room was definitely an upgrade to the suite that we had at prior hotel. Clean coffee maker or fridge would have been nice. Staff was pleasant/helpful. Felt I was fairly compensated for issues with keys/access.
30,Customer service is terrible. Staff is impolite and unwilling to help in a friendly way since the day we arrived! Our room was not cleaned for two days so we had to call house keeping twice! Our TV was glitchy we couldn’t even watch regular TV. We rented a movie and had to request a refund because the moving was choppy we couldn’t watch it. When we told the front desk about it it was completely dismissed. Also the rooms have no fridge no microwave and no coffee maker which was strange for such a hotel. I would not be staying at the Luxor again.
30,Family room located next to ice machine (not ideal with kids wouldn’t have cared if I didn’t have kids with me) dust on shelving in room Trash under towel rack in bathroom and dresser towels located very low in the bathroom
50,Our stay was amazing! We couldn't have asked for a better time! Staff went above and beyond. Room and beds were amazing as well. We ate at the Public House which was delicious. We had a slight problem with one of our showers which was taken care of right away.
30,"Elevator situation. Can take too long. Not enough elevators. They need room card to operate some malfunction.    No fridge no coffee no parking. All these cost extra. Be aware.    Card to operate parking gates didn't work. They ""fixed"" it later but how can it break in the first place??? it's not like it run on Windows updates!"
50,Went to Vegas to celebrate my sons 21st birthday. Staff was very friendly and courteous. Check in and check out was a breeze. Only complaint is that the room didn’t have a microwave and they were outdated. Needed remodeling.
10,Short version: My sheets were stained with blood. I was moved to a different room but I was disgusted by the entire situation. The person who switched my room was completely detached and treated the matter like it was just another day. Housekeeping came and changed the sheets. When I went back to my room I found two other ladies going in bc the room was assigned to them after. My belongings were still in the room!! No sir! that is not OK. Traveler beware!
30,This is not a high end hotel. Rooms are old and outdated. Beds were uncomfortable. On one side of our room there were guests running a daycare. On the otherside of our room was a porn studio I think. Above our room sounded like a RAP recording studio- not to mention the helicopters that constantly circle the north tower. I bet king tut and cleopatra would stay there again.
40,Everything was pretty much as expected...clean room friendly staff lots of games to choose from. However the amenities fall quite short. There are no coffee makers in the upgraded rooms. We stayed in a Tower Premier room and had to spend $8-$10 for a cup of coffee down at Starbucks. There are also no mini-fridges to store left-overs from high-priced meals.
10,this hotel was disgusting. on top of getting items stolen out of my room- like clothes (ew!) the room was gross the beds were so soft my back was killing me by the end of the trip and the staff was rude. Save your money and go somewhere else the Luxor is Trash!
50,I was very satisfied with the experience and customer service we received. Will definitely recommend this hotel and casino to anyone. I do wish the rooms had a refrigerator in them. Overall extremely good trip
10,Live music is nice but rooms are hardly sound proofed at all so not exactly the restful setup before traveling out the next day. All guest services did to help was let me know it should be done by 1 am.    Parking pass didn’t work so had to wait in long line just to get other ticket validated.    Don’t waste your money here. Pyramid is cool but there are better places to try to sleep close by.
10,Hotel was old and outdated. The room we stayed in required a 29 floor climb on a shady elevator that seemed like it would break any minute. The room itself was dingy and dirty. Spend the extra hundred dollars you save on any other hotel
30,The rooms are run down. There are no usb chargers in the room. None of our party members won at the slots at all. There were 6 of us. The walls in the hallways were dirty and the wallpaper was peeling in areas. The buffet was gross and over priced. I doubt we will stay here again unless they make improvements.
50,Great service great amenities clean rooms house keeping was great accommodated my brother who traveled with me that was handicapped extended an extra day front desk made it effortless staff was courteous and friendly
10,TV kept freezing in room even after maintenance came to fix it!  valet supervisor chad was rude and unhelpful we double paid valet  Never again  This was a second try for us and still disappointed  Last stay there was a used bandage in our bed linen.
10,Booked online. Thought it was a great deal. Check-in and discovered cost was several times higher than online booking. Room was outdated. Water smelled like sulfur. “Resort” amenities included the closed pool and a list of things not included. Thin walls. And TV that hardly works.
30,Despicable the charges for 99cents store non quality toiletries. Also the cheap peeling tint in my room was tacky. I will strongly r to my company a change of hotels for 2024. And as the top representative in the West coast my opinion will matter!
10,It was terrible. When we checked in we saw the person who was next to see us walk away. The room had no microwave or fridge. The room was so plain. The shower was broken. I would never go there again
50,Couples 2 day trip to las vegas. The Luxor exceeded our expectations. Good value for being on the strip and convenient to the things we were interested in doing. Rooms were quiet / good sound proofing and spacious. Best shower ever with excellent shower pressure and great temperature controls!!
40,The rooms are old the hotel is huge (expect a walk to the elevator) but the staff is very professional and polite. Nobody came to see the AC that didn’t really work (it acted funny.) No “DO NO DISTURB” slip.
10,"If you like to be treated like crap have no running water randomly love a room the has an overpowering smell of weed and like to be told ""it is what it is"" or ""you can stay at another casino"" when complaining to the staff...... then this is the place for you! On more than one occasion they treated guests as if they were doing the guest a favor for them staying at the casino! And if you're a ""valued"" MLIFE Rewards member (Platinum or NOIR) you can forget about seeing a casino host or getting any support from the because they seem to either not be working don't answer calls and don't care. I received help from the Mandalay Bay casino host with unbelievable support and I wasn't even staying with them! Their host couldn't get a Luxor casino host either...for a week! Worst two week stay I've had in Vegas and I've been going for decades and been in some crappy places. Save yourself a bad vacation and stay at Mandalay Bay MGM Grand Aria Bellagio or hell...even Excalibur."
10,Unless you’re on a super tight budget stay somewhere else! There are options.    If you must stay at Luxor try to get a tower room and not pyramid. The pyramid rooms are super outdated and dirty. Trust me stay away from pyramid rooms
50,Loved my stay at Luxor. I went alone but did not feel lonely. Had a great time especially at the game tables. Food is great. Drinks at Diablo are the best. Staff service is exceptional. Elevator going sideways is an experience.
20,I would of liked to have made this hotel our go-to but our checkout experience was way odd. Really rude. I only like giving positive reviews but even my more patient wife didn't understand why were treated that way?
50,Good place nice comfortable bed clean rooms great check in good food nice grounds close to everything good value for the price helpful at front desk. Stayed for two nights and never had a problem. Thanks
20,Shower wouldn’t drain and made my room smell like sewage. Bathtub wasn’t cleaned from last user either. All this for a $10 upgrade I paid for. Won’t use Luxor and probably won’t stay at any Vegas resort again after this. Most likely will stay in Primm since it’s only 20/30 minutes outside of the city.
20,I have stayed here several times but it seems the quality has gone down. I had issues with the TV not working no hot water uncomfortable bed elevator issues. And we came across a pile of fecal matter in the hotel walking to our room. After being made aware the staff still had not cleaned it up after 1 hour. Gross!
40,We stayed at the Luxor during a work trip. It was comfortable and in close proximity to the expo we were attending. Room was clean and bathroom seemed like it had been partially updated in recent years. Another restaurant would be nice for the meals when you just don’t have time to go hunt an option down. Diablo’s was pretty tasty though!
20,With its quirky pyramid design and impressive exterior lights this hotel promised so much. Unfortunately it failed to live up to early expectations. The room despite being large and spacious had decor which was tired and tatty much the same as the rest of the hotel. The facilities were poor no mini bar tea and coffee making facilities in the room and no housekeeping service to make up the room. When I tried to contact housekeeping to request clean towels the phone didn’t even work. Definitely would not recommend this hotel wish we had stayed in the Venetian which looked much nicer
40,Overall I was satisfied. However I was quite disappointed that there was not a mini refrigerator nor a coffee pot in the room. It's become such a standard in hotel rooms that I've stayed in over the years that I did not even check that they were included when I booked my room. I DID end up renting a mini refrigerator for $25.00.
30,Another Vegas stay this time to Luxor pyramid room. Noisy above and from check-in area where music seemed to play all night. Casino smokier than others and overall ventilation could use major upgrade. Pyramid inclinators also had operational issues during our stay.
10,Terrible hotel and terrible service. The line to check in is a mile long at all times of the day. The room (I had a Suite) was outdated and smelled like smoke. The thermostat couldn’t hold a temperature and the TVs didn’t work. Just a gross and terrible stay. This Casino is equally trashy and gross and it is not near any other relevant or nice casinos/hotels. Stay somewhere else like the Wynn or Encore it’s worth the money.
40,Great price. Much cheaper and just as good as The Mandalay Bay. Excellent friendly staff. They do need better TVs. It wasnt HD but thats a tiny complaint. Very nice hotel and like I said very reasonably priced.
40,Overall my stay was ok. I would come again but would probably opt for a more expensive room. I kind wish I'd got the opportunity to see the options prior like maybe a video walkthrough on the website. The staff was great. The restaurant's staff was great and food was good. There were a few things that could have been better but it was still worth the stay. Property is nice and a great location.
40,My room was robbed and the casino hotel did nothing to reassure me or to make me feel safe not even offer in me a new room has not tracked down my stuff done nothing Help solve the problem Will not stay at the luxor casino ever again in my lifetime
10,Luxor hotel needs to be renovated. It's dingy and broken down. There are leaks everywhere and the rooms are not great. the amenities are old and falling apart. My toilet broke in half at the base and water was flooding the floor. It was a hazzard and made for inconvenience.
20,Guest room was poor quality. Did not have basic things like coffee maker mini fridge or microwave. Location is average. Staff were friendly. Casino was clean. Food court was mediocre over priced and not very many options.
20,I was there for the PPAI expo and being my first experience there it was terrible the Mold smell in the room and hallway was just terrible. As soon as I got in the room there was a message saying the water was shut off. So I didn’t have water until I got back from the convention
30,CES trip was the cheapest option. Room had to be changed due to the smell of pot. Was given food credit as compensation but couldn’t be used at food court. Tables were >$15 per hand and had limited variety. Buffet was average and forgettable
30,For the price the Luxor was fine. However it is very out of the way and anything you really want to do is a pretty long walk. The mobile check-in and digital keys were nice and convenient. The Starbucks and Diablo Cantina were awesome. Our room was a little outdated. Our sink had issues draining and our A/C didn’t work half the time. Our outlets also struggled to hold any plugs such as my hair dryer curling iron and steamer. The plugs would just fall right out. The elevators also had issues–we had to get off and switch elevators several times and heard many other guests saying the same. The casino also has a stronger cigarette smell and it was the only one in Vegas that we visited that I could strongly smell cigarettes. Personally I would spend the extra money to be further down the strip.
30,Before using anything in the room make sure that the room has internet and cellular service. On a recent business trip cellular did not work in a room accessed by the 1A elevator bank. I was moved to a room in the 2B elevator bank and the service was better but spotty. There was often a bit of a wait for the elevators to arrive.
40,We've stayed at LUXOR many times over the years and have seen the changes. The latest are good except as noted above the mattress was too soft (and so were the pillows). The new room decor in our tower room was very nice and almost everything actually worked! Our room was clean. The hotel hallways casino area lobby - everything were also clean. I wish hotels would put a night stand on each side of the ed instead of just one side. It wold be so helpful to have an overnight phone charging location for each of the two of us.
30,We stayed at Luxor due to location to the conference we were attending. It was convenient and a great price. The staff were very helpful and nice. The hotel is a little dated and not as clean as it could be but overall we were happy with our experience. The execution of the theme is very good. I would consider staying here again.
10,This place is a dump very old and tired with limited food options that are way over priced for what you get. Every where you look something needs fixing or painting. Inside of the elevators are very dirty.
40,I have stayed at Luxor many times I would NEVER stay in the pyramid ONLY the towers. If you stay in the pyramid you might as well stay at Excalibur and save some money. The bathroom is a little janky but it does the job.
10,The front staff is rude and not helpful at all. They didn’t help when I asked for assistance for my elderly mother and myself when it came to checking in. They kept giving me an excused as to why our room was not ready and it took 8 hours later for our room to be ready. Also our sink kept getting clogged even when it got “serviced”.
20,Payed more than was stated. Rooms were poor smelled like cigarettes carpet stained . Wasn’t as clean as it should of been.poor customer service wouldn’t recommend this hotel to anyone. Price should of been cheaper for the quality.
50,the room was clean and the staff was extremely nice and helpful when I needed assistance. from the moment I got to the check in it was the easiest self-check in and I really like the keyless key on the app!
30,Between lack of communication between staff and security and the quality of restaurant food also going downhill the only positive is that the Slot machines are currently up to date. Also Bell Service was amazing.
50,Totally refreshed interior central location. Enjoyed the selection of table games especially the Fortune Blackjack and Ultimate Holdem.  Could have more video poker machines but nice variety and not crowded.
40,The Luxor provided a perfect spot for my trip to Vegas for CES. It has easy access to the strip. The room was nice. Not too fancy but plenty big and clean. You can opt in or out of housekeeping. Parking is available for a fee.
20,Just a depressing property. This place could be so nice if they invested into it. I had black mold in my bathroom and lots of dust buildup around the bed frame. My suite upgrade was a bit nicer but still in major need of renovation. With some shag carpet it would have been 1972 all over again.
10,We had a horrible experience at the Luxor.    Checkin in the early hours of the morning took over an hour. The lady who served us on the front desk seemed very uninterested in assisting and oddly just did not seem in a good head space. She asked us no less than four times if we needed a car park among other repetitious questions. She was unknowledgeable on rooms and swung her screen round to show us the prices and then charged my Amex a totally different amount. When questioned she was unable to articulate why there was a difference and tried to negotiate on the hold amount per room. All very odd. It also struck us that there was a lot of time stalling on her part. It shouldn’t take 15 to 20 mins to check someone in. No wonder lines are so long    When we finally got to our room we were greeted with a heavy tobacco odor it was so strong you could actually see the smoke in the air. It was as if a large group of people had chain smoked in the room for a week. There’s no ability to open a window or ventilate in any way. We called to complain and switch room but we’re told to call back after 11 the next day as no rooms were available even after pleading with them that my wife suffers severe allergies to smoke and it was a health risk for us. Eventually they sent someone who arrived around 3am to deodor our room. Not joking his answer was to spray our room with a can of air freshener. When we asked him basic questions he said he had no idea and doesn’t usually work here?!  Needless to say the next day we both woke up with headaches and the taste of tobacco in our mouths    After many failed attempts to actually connect with someone on the phone and then refusing to wait in the queue for another hour we decided to give up and simply stay out of our room as much as we could. A hotel room (especially when I spent $2000 here) should at minimum be a place that offers a refuge and be comfortable. This room was anything but.    Eventually we were able to get hold of someone who was able to swap out rooms. Too little too late. The lack of care service empathy comfort and appreciation was sorely missing.    My best advice is to consider spending more and staying elsewhere. We have visited Vegas many times and this property is in a league of its own. It’s an outlier in service and quality for all the wrong reasons. Further we have come to expect a certain standard from MGM properties but the trust has gone there too. There are other very good options in Vegas
50,The Luxor Hotel and Casino is a great place to stay with friendly staff and clean rooms. The unique setting is a must see and the casino and restaurants are excellent. The casino has the latest games and the restaurants have a variety for anyone’s taste.
50,The room and staff were wonderful. The only thing that I missed was my room having a mini fridge and microwave. Everything else was great with the room and my stay at the Luxor. I would recommend staying at the Luxor to everyone who plans on taking a trip to wonderful Las Vegas!
20,Elevator wouldn’t register key but tried another elevator and the same key worked. Room smelled like smoke. There was a big broken tile in bathroom floor. Casino has a very old look. The whole place needs to be renovated.
50,Perfect location the hotel overall was just perfect! From the ease of checking in to upgrading our rooms to the buffet and pyramid cafe. Everything was good no complaints at all. Really appreciated the excellent customer service from the receptionist who checked us in!
20,The resort was not as clean as it used to be amenities are less also no toilet paper in the casino bathroom the staff was ok overall…………the mandalay was pure trash the drinks were weak and expensive half the moving walkways don’t work
40,I stayed at the Luxor on business and the guest room was very comfortable always clean and there were plenty of towels. I would recommend Luxor as an option for anyone attending a convention or meeting at Mandalay.
20,For all the money this property takes in you would think that they could make basic repairs. An old water leak through the ceiling had left the drywall tape stained split and hanging loose. Marks/tears on walls counter tops and furniture also showed age. Every door in the suite creaked. Convenient location was a plus though.
50,My second stay at Luxor and had a Tower room very nicely updated and comfortable and a large tub and shower as well. Room was quiet at night and I enjoyed the ease of getting coffee in the morning. Valet was also quick to retrieve my car even when they were obviously swamped. The sandwich shop at back of casino by sports book is also a good place to eat I highly recommend.
40,The Luxor is nice. The room was clean and free of problems. The elevators can be a little confusing and my key card for the elevator didn't work quite right. There was a long line to check in but that's Vegas for you. This property is nice and close to the airport.
30,It was nice to stay by the stadium but the hotel amenities and elevator service left much more to be desired. Having to wait over 15 minutes for an elevator seems unreasonable. Especially when you clearly can hear that no other elevator in that quad is running.
30,The room was dingy and outdated. Room had carpet stains uncomfortable beds dusty closet and drawers. Door handles sticky. Bathroom tub dusty with stains… I do have to say that the downstairs deli had the best double cheeseburgers….
40,This is a great location and property if you are attending a Mandalay Bay Convention. The walk is easy and the shops along the way interesting and useful. The staff is helpful and always in good spirits. My only complaint is that the table minimums are too high in off-peak hours.
20,bathtub was broken  I arrived in my room there were no bath towels or hygiene products I had to call and ask I paid early check in and my room was not ready bad service at all change for Aria resorts and casino
30,I had to moved to three different rooms because of issues with maintenance and cleanliness. I noticed long dark hair in the shower stalls and tub from previous guests. Seemed like there were a lot of water leaks because of recent rain including in one of the rooms I stayed in. The staff is awesome though and very friendly.
40,Nice hotel all good except service in the bar in front of the reception desk that I ordered a drink for my wife from the menu and was told they did not serve from the menu during the game football games. Within 5 min a two young ladies ordered from the menu and they served them drinks from the menu. Right in front of me did not think it was to profesional on their behalf
10,Hotel Room Theft/Premise liability - Staying at the newly renovated East Tower at Luxor has been a horrible experience. When we walked in I noticed that on the hand towel there was a dark hair and then stuff left over in the bathroom. I wouldn't have complained about these little mishaps BUT as we left our room unattended for 2-2.5 hours it was broken into.    How was it broken into? Well someone had to have used a key. This room is located near the stairs and exit. This must have made this hallway or us clear targets. Security was involved and we filled out a report. Hotels know who badges into rooms. Housekeeping came down and shared that none of their staff entered our room. Several items were stolen and this person with a key walked out with a backpack with numerous personal belongings several charges and cables battery packs and cash.    Staff also have not been cordial about this issue. Housekeeping prior to a lady coming down to give us food and beverage vouchers was rude on the phone and accused of of stating it was there staff when there housekeeping cart was found outside our door. Who else has the capacity to enter our room unattended so we were just stating that someone with a key came into our room and ransacked it and left with our belongings with no consequences from Luxor. This I believe would be considered premises liability as Luxor allowed someone with a key to go into a room of a guest and allow theft to occur.    Engineering also came by to double check the door and said that the door closed correctly and no one physical broke in and that it is suspected a person with a room key broke into the room.    Please think twice before you stay here at Luxor......theft can occur in your locked room while you're away. This happened between a 2-2.5 hour window so we almost feel like we were targeted.
10,Rain water from a heavy downpour started to leak from the window and light socket (which is an electrical issue). Water fell on to the desk and very likely ruined my laptop. Will have to take it to an Apple Store once I’m back home for inspection.
10,Elevators didn’t work room was from 1950 STUNK of cigarette smoke staff was okay at best obviously who ever owns the Luxor has no concerns towards their customers and their stay. We will never be back.
30,Overall this hotel is decent if you get it a cheap rate we stayed 4 nights in mid-December the World Rodeo finals were in town that week along with UFC so there was not a shortage of things to do. The rooms are very dated and have weird smoke smell but fairly clean with that they can be the housekeeping staff was in everyday with no issues we had a check in issue but it was rectified by Pasqual a great employee we did have a pyramid suite it has a sitting room mini fridge 2 queen beds and a jacuzzi. We did have issues with he water pressure and hot water that did not get rectified but it is what it is. We didn't spend much time in the room the casino floor is decent would be ideal to filter out the smoke smell with a better ventilation system. We had a couple meals at the playbook restaurant decent pub food with great service. we sat at the bar by the elevator 1 a couple awesome bartenders and 2 other ones (not so much) the biggest problem is its at the opposite side of the strip and not much goes on in this area its a decent spot if you just want to play at the casino and not really leave the resort you are somewhat in a weird part of the strip.
30,The resort is a nice place to visit however I would not stay in the hotel again. The rooms are way to pricey for what you get. There was no fridge nor microwave in room at all. If you wanted a fridge you had to rent it.
10,Nobody answers the damn phone from Spa to concierge restaurant to font desk. Youll be put on hold forever. Ive tried calling for three days straight. NOBODY EVER ANSWERS THE PHONE! It was so ridiculous!
10,What could have happened in 2 days in Las Vegas to lose that much ?    It's not what you think. Our room have been stolen while we were away. Staff member ? Bad door security ? Nobody knows as their is no cameras on the whole floor. Expert came to examine the door: Somebody did enter before we went back in. Officer confirm THIS IS NOT THE FIRST SECURITY ISSUE. check pictures.    And who's fault is this ? Apparently not Luxor who throw you from security services to guest services before you finish your sentence on the phone. Hopefully they are very sorry that we lost 10 000$ worth of goods and wish us the best for this New Year.    Just glad nobody was in the room during the thief so nobody got hurt from this.    Besides: Except additional fees and our rooms wasn’t cleaned once.    Las Vegas is great overall they are plenty of other hotel in the Strip. Luxor location and pyramid are impressive and enjoyable. The feeling in the casino is not animated as the Caesar palace Excalibur or the Strat for example.    Would NOT recommend Luxor for SECURITY and ATMOSPHERE reasons.
40,Our stay was for the NFL Raiders vs Chiefs game on Saturday. We had a blast at the game and then back to the Luxor to party & play! Staff was great we played all types of games including three card poker ( that was a lot of fun ) so yes I will recommend staying here to all my family and friends!
40,Staff at check in was extremely friendly. Upgraded our room without us even asking. Room was slightly outdated but bigger than expected with a nice soaking tub however having a mini fridge was a huge bonus! Check out staff as extremely friendly as well.  Only downside little far from the rest of the strip as well as the as alarms blaring in the hotel and rooms at 1:30 a.m. very startling.  Overall pleasant stay!
50,The Luxor is a five star in my book. It’s the hotel of choice for my friends and family due to the friendly service of the hotel staff. It has a relaxing atmosphere. Very comfortable clean rooms and great dining choices.
40,Took a short 3 night stay at Luxor upon arriving I felt weird like it was silly but after walking around and taking in the Luxor I began to appreciate it and enjoyed staying there. I would definitely book here again.
10,I stayed at the Luxor with my family and it was the most terrible experience. We got there and had to pay a resort fee even though we had already purchased a bundle. Which I would understand if it didn’t take an hour to leave every morning (people don’t understand how to pay for parking or leave facility and there was no attendant directing people) the escalators never worked and the parking garage always looked like a mess. The rooms don’t have refrigerators so good luck keeping leftovers. Oh yeah and we found a GIANT FLYING COCKROACH in our bathroom. I have a ton of pictures. The people who work there barely did anything we got a new room but we were in there for days. No refund. And we got double charged for parking. DO NOT STAY AT LUXOR! Period find somewhere else.
50,I took my son to see the raiders game and this hotel was close by to my surprise you can walk to the stadium through a bridge they close on game days and experience all the fans walking as well. This made it very convenient!
40,This was my favorite between the Flamingo and Linq. I didn't give it an excellent because it didn't have a manual latch on the inside door. I like to utilize that latch for security as a hotel worker once gave my room and key to a guest- they walked right in (didn't happen here)!!!
50,Had the best time celebrating my 40th bday. They helped make our stay that much more enjoyable with a friendly check in and upgrade of room upon realization I was staying there to celebrate my birthday. Their service and kindness kicked off what went on to be a memorable experience for my wife and I. We will definitely return to Luxor based on this experience alone.
10,Dirty rooms burst water pipes broken curtains busted elevator indicators and tiles as well as broken door closers - all that just within what we saw from our one night stay at the Luxor. Alright for an emergency stay for a night (we had missed our flight) but in no way shape or form the hotel you should pick for your authentic Vegas experience!
20,Not worth it.  I don’t stay on the Vegas Strip often this was my worst experience so far. We chose Luxor only because we went for the Blue Man Group and didn’t want to be out driving to a hotel in Vegas late at night.  (The show itself was Fantastic! Fun entertaining and family friendly!! Highly recommend!)  Pros:  -the VIP checkout man was very helpful and helped us checkout after we had problems with the auto checkout even though we aren’t VIP.  -convenience of staying where the Blue Man Group show plays  -Room was generally clean  Cons:  -Lack of customer safety in the rooms. There is neither a deadbolt nor a hotel security latch on the door. The maid knocked and Entered our room at 9:38 even though checkout is 11am. She woke us and scared my children. Staff should not be able to enter a guest room without their permission especially when it’s occupied.  -check-in/out line is 20 minutes Minimum morning and evening  -Room rate is advertised at $32 but by the time you add all the fees taxes and extra resort fee it’s pushing $120.  -On top of the room rate it is $18 per night to park  -Basic amenities in a typical hotel room are only available for extra charge (ie mini fridge)  -Room is in need of repair has large area of peeling wallpaper near the window  -hair in the sheets    The bottom line is it’s just not worth the money unless you are there to gamble? I won’t ever stay on the Strip again. It’s worth the 10 minute drive to stay at a typical hotel whose aim is to please the customer and provide a great quality experience rather than just get you in the door to play the slots.
50,I surprised my man for his Solar Return a trip to Vegas. I chose the Luxor because of it representation of the pyramids from Egypt. They also have a Kong Tut experience as well within. It's next to being in Egypt .
20,"Let's start with the positives. 1) Sam at the front desk was excellent. 2)The rumors online say that Luxor may face demolition in the near future (If you don't understand why i put that in the positives category think again. 3) It was cheap to stay there. 4) The bed was comfortable.    Now for the negatives. 1) The hotel room was dated 2) The valet parking was so understaffed and took so long to drop of your car or retrieve it that the staff constantly (and sincerely) apologized for the long delays and blamed it on management's decision to cut back on staff 3) The buffet gets a good rating for quantity of food but the quality was awful. I've had better food at McDonalds 4) Getting a problem fixed was a joke (a bad joke). 5) If you are an MGM gold or above ""member"" they hand you a card with a special phone number to call if you have any problems at all. It would have been a nice touch if someone ever answered the phone! It's a week after our stay and I'll be the phone is still ringing. 6) I learned years ago that problems usually start at the top of a company. The staff here seemed overworked drained but tried their best but it was obvious at every turn that the whole system there is broken.    Bottom line if you are looking for a cheap room on the strip and go in with low expectations then this hotel will be ok. Think of it as being on the level of Circus Circus or Excalibur. Wait maybe I should apologize to Circus Circus and Excalibur."
30,Rooms given are very old and not maintained well. Need to walk lot and no clear instructions for finding places inside. No minimal courtesy by room service to knock door and wait for response. Over all disappointed with the stay. Faced shower issue on 2nd day of stay.
50,I had a wonderful time during my stay at the Luxor. From the start it was very easy checking in all I had to do was check in from my phone and my room was ready before the normal check in time of 3 pm. Rooms are clean.
20,Rooms were bad quality dirty trashy beat up furniture.Beds were good plenty of hot water..no blankets..safe didn't work carpet was tripping me broken lamps bulbs not working dresser drawers bad
30,The property is still recovering from the pandemic. The pool is closed during the winter months. I did find the Pyramid is quieter than the towers. As the towers have street noice and the Pyramid does not.
30,We called the front desk and as soon as I said my question they hung up on me- u tried to call again and no one picked up. We had late checkout and got about 3 emails telling us not to forget to checkout at 11 which were annoying but we assumed automatic (even if I believe they should have a program that would automatically send email with the late checkout time)- this was whatever but then we cleaning lady came knocking why we were still there at 12:00- she was confused but nice when we told her we had late checkout- we just didn’t like that there was no communication letting her know. The room has no fridge or coffee maker which is usually standard in hotel rooms but it was my bad for missing that when booking just a little heads up. It was clean and a nice room but the way they communicated was an inconvenience. I don’t think we would stay again since there are so many other options in Vegas.
50,It was a very friendly enviroment and the stall is really nice  the restauranta are very good they have a lot of good casino games. Since i like gambling alot is a good place to find a lil bit of everything. Thanks
20,Our room had a smell that emanated from the bathroom. It smelled like a dirty hot tub. We let it go for the first night we were there but the 2nd day it was worse. I mentioned it to the staff who put in a maintenance request to have it resolved. They were very friendly and told me that if nothing could be done about it they would move us. No one ever contacted me or updated me on the situation. I checked in 2 more times and they had no updates. We were not moved and nothing was done about the smell. Pretty gross.
20,Lets starts by saying that the rooms are outdated there is a bad cigarette smell even in their corner suites water clogs in the showers & sinks baggage claim is not prompt or professional check in process takes a long time with staff and the parking prices are outrageous.
50,Had a blast! Luxor was affordable clean renovated great staff. Can’t wait to go back. Tenders steak house has great food. The cafe also had good selections. Lots of fun slots and table games. Good live music as well
10,Pretty bad hotel. Luxor is just too outdated. For the amount you pay you would expect better quality. 800 for a suite room with aging furniture and popcorn ceiling with a cigarette smell doesn’t scream luxury to me. Tv is very old and they lock the hdmi ports so you won’t be able to stream anything. Even aria allows this.    Barely any toiletries provided just simple shampoo and bar soap. Nothing fancy like in a suite at the Bellagio or Cosmo.    Again the room is just too old mismatched furniture and it’s not very functional.
30,The furniture is long overdue for replacement. The room could have been cleaner. Very poor job vacuuming and dusting. There was NO refrigerator microwave or coffee maker. They only provided shampoo no conditioner.
40,it was okay but my room smelled like cigarettes 😭. but it isn’t a bad hotel overall i would say it’s pretty good compared to other hotels but the elevators are kinda scary. but i would stay again. they have some nice exhibits. ALSO it’s affordable compared to other hotels around.
40,Elevators would stop at every other floor on the way downstairs and that was really annoying seeing as how we were on the 10th floor. My room smelled like the little league football team was staying there & there was ash on just about every table in the room. Staff was very helpful & friendly & everything thing else in the hotel was great to experience
50,I’ve stayed at this location many times. I prefer to stay in the Towers vs. Pyramid. The towers are quiet and extremely clean. I’ve never experienced an issue. I just wish there was a quicker way to get to the strip!
40,Although it was cheap on going on first week of January of the new year but it is still a walk from Luxor to the MGM monrail station. Wifi connects up to two devices (from what I experience). Can't complain of the pool if its empty since it is kind of chill to even go outside. Room was exceptionally clean once arrive and experience no problems so far.
50,Great place to stay! Will definitely come back. Nice buffet. Nice staff. Good location. Nice bed. Fair rate. There should not be a minimum of character in order to leave a good review on TripAdvisor. :-)
20,Sprinkler heads appeared moldy outlets are looser then the slots nothing stays plugged in. Hot water and a/c worked when it wanted to. Floor and walls were dirty. Beds were clean. Check in was brutal and not enough staffing. Casino was great. Will look elsewhere for room to stay in next trip.
10,Almost everything in the hotel that my colleagues and I had to use was busted. I rarely complain about anything but this was pretty bad.    1. Elevators in “Elevator 2” corner were all sorts of dismay. One elevator would always stop at floor 8 and/or 9 and also wouldn’t close the door until the “timelimit” was hit. I literally kept on shaking the entire side panel on another elevator which made a loud noise / allowed me to see the wall behind it moving. The best looking elevator out of them all had a camera missing. Panels for controls / wiring were either hanging open or missing completely. Elevator button on our floor (13) didn’t work on one side. Everything creeked to the extreme.    2. Couldn’t get out of the parking garage with hotel key. Had to constantly use the help button and give someone my hotel room number. Was told could come to front desk to get key to get in and out but lines were always long at the front desk.    3. We didn’t notice till the last day when cleaning up the room but there were a pair of black panties underneath the sofa chair in the room. We were all men inside the room :)    4. Escalators kept on going in and out of order.    5. Doors to parking garage are supposed to automatically open when walking towards them. One of them stopped midway and colleague ran into it.    6. All lights in room would flicker very randomly.    7. Outlet that was supposed to be embedded into the wall was hanging out.    8. No fridge in room unless u “rent” it.    9. TV volume would default to “30” whenever you first adjusted it from turning it on. Not helpful when your friends are already sleeping.    Every staff member I ran into / talked to was helpful. Unfortunately this was my friend’s first experience in vegas and this was not a good place to start. This also isn’t my first time staying here so was surprised on how bad everything was.
40,Hotel location is not the best but still ok walk from elevator to room was very far staff always pleasant casino is nice but walking escalators seem to always be broken every visit. Good food selection in stores late when most things closed.
30,Room didn’t have a mini fridge. You have to request/rent it. No coffee maker. Don’t expect to have a nice view….it’s difficult to see out their windows due to a metal mess. Elevators need better upkeep and maintenance.
30,I've only stayed at the Luxor for 4 trips now. It's only gone down hill. I have real concerns about the cleanliness of the rooms. Sharp shards of glass on my bathroom floor that weren't cleaned after a cleaning was requested. This mirrored my last trip where I was given an unclean room. I'm willing to bet the glass is still on the floor as of this review.
20,Leaky pipes and a hole in the roof outside our room broken elevators that either didn't recognize your room key the TV was hard set at a max volume of 25 of 75 so it was nearly impossible to hear. Loud guests in the halls at night shouting
30,My experience there wasn’t as expected. Had to get food and couldn’t warm it up. I couldn’t keep food cold so I wasted more money. My experience could’ve been better. I had fun but spent too much money.
10,This hotel and casino has gone down so much it makes me sad to see how unclean the rooms and entire hotel was we stayed a week and never saw or heard vacuums it smelled funny and it was extremely muggy in the rooms and Hallways you can tell the difference being in other places on the strip. There are noticeable cracks all along the ceilings also. The elevators were rocky and felt unbalanced and the carpets have waves in them that someone can trip on. Wouldn’t recommend. I would pay more to stay somewhere else more comfortable wouldn’t stay again if anyone decides to stay here I would highly recommend you check out at a checkout desk and make sure that your charges are correct
30,Shower was almost unusable - major points deduction. Modern flat screen TV with an ancient cable box attached. Looks awful! The beds were comfortable. No in-room refrigerator - looks like they have been removed and you need to rent them?
30,The Luxor is looking dates these days. I used elevator 3A and it is very banged up. No USB charger in room TV reception was poor. Service was very good however. The price of food in the food court was insane. Hallway noise in the wee hours of the morning was an issue.
20,Over all definatly staying somewhere else next time for the price we paid the stay was less then satisfactory no fridge no microwave no coffee didn't get told about the breakfast so we missed that the whole week. Bartenders charge what ever they want and don't stick with the same price.
30,Rooms are good for the price and the location is good. Valet parking is a ripoff. I stayed 2 nights probably spent $2500 on the property and still had to pay $60 for valet parking all while being a Pearl member. There are much better casino options on other properties.
30,Came in to our room and smelled like cigarette smoke. Guest services said they don’t have smoking room so we weren’t moved to a different room but instead they sent someone to our room to spray the carpet and A/C with chlorine/bleach smelling freshener.
10,I stayed at the hotel for eight nights even prepaid for my reservation. Housekeeping knocked on my door several times to inform that I was listed as a “rush” checkout DESPITE my prepaid reservation. I attempted to speak with the manager about the situation and Martin was EXTREMELY rude even hung up on me several times. The shower also does not drain properly so it fills up with water while showering. The television freezes a lot and management blames it on hotel network traffic. Valet is downright rude regardless of the gratuity. Some of the housekeeping staff will lie claim they’re coming back to clean the room but you seldom return. The tour desk staff will lie about timeshare incentives then they’re nasty when you bring it to their attention. I will say however Jesus was nice manager who genuinely seemed to care about guest. Whereas managers like Martin is emotionally abusive! Chicken and waffles at the Pyramid Cafe is burnt majority of the days. Martin just really made the guest relations a horrific experience.
50,Luxor is the best place to stay in the strip easy to get to and from  Without long wait lines during New Years. Great place to stay die  Checking in with there Mobile check in no long wait times for me or my guest .
10,I stayed here because it was cheaper than most and now I know why. Shower head was filthy corners of shower are never cleaned. Noise coming from wall kept my girl up for two nights(water pipes shaking). We opted out for no room service and someone still came into our place twice and cleaned. Buffet was terrible and was $40. I’d rather eat McDonald’s. As much as the staff is friendly and nice they need a nice place to call home and Luxor isn’t it.
50,My stay was ok. It was hard to find my room thanks to the security lady that helped me.the walk to the room from parking was long as hack. Parking cost was high and hard to figure it out to pay to get out.
10,4 hour check in room!!! Worse ever!!!! Dirty room still a had mess from last guest! Including dirty towels toiletries and garbage!! And still got charged for a full night and didn’t get a clean room until 4am!! Never will stay there again
40,We arrived on December 28th 2022 for the New Year but the room upgrade we were able to get made us extend twice or departure! We left on January 5 instead 2nd! The corner suite with a mini refrigerator and the bath tub by the sky window was very unexpected and appreciated! We will go back.
10,Broken equipment (elevator) no ability to move around resort without horrible delays. (I use a mobile chair). Untrained or uncaring managers and staff. I use MGM on every stay and this is first time I have had a bad experience. Luxor's building and staff are the worst I ever seen in MGM properties.
20,Staff are friendly but the hotel has lots of problem when compared with paid price. First the lights in the room were not work properly. Second the room direction sign is not correct and that will make you walk for a great circle to get your room. Last is parking for guest is worse than parking for non-guest. The information on their website is not matched with the staff saying. So make sure that you ask them clearly before you check out.
50,Check is a little slow (like all LV hotels) but everything afterward was good. The room was reasonably priced and clean and well-maintained. Hotel has good connection to Mandalay Bay which makes a good choice of shops and restaurants.
10,I have stayed at Luxor for decades as a players card member. Never again! The hotel has not been maintained and MGM is charging junk fees on just about everything. Parking is very expensive and so are the resort fees. I was comped a room and would still not return after all the fees and issues. TV did not work shower drain was plugged semen stains were on bed skirts mold in windows etc. Requests for repair and correction were never completed. I will take my gaming elsewhere and would like a refund of the fees paid.
50,Stayed for a family vacation for a week between xmass and new year's which was our second visit in the last two months. Recommend tower suits are they are newer. Love the mobile check in and the ability to do everything on the mobile app. The price was very reasonable and the stay was comfortable.
50,Our room was clean but a bit of a walk from the elevator. All of the staff was very friendly especially at the front desk. We enjoyed the tram and liked that we could walk to T-Mobile Arena for a hockey game.
10,I’m a gold member didn’t even get a free upgrade room the front desk doesn’t even smile her service was poor. I will never come back to this hotel again that I don’t feel welcome. I asked for tower room and she just said there’s no available with attitude.
10,This hotel is a joke. Stay anywhere else. Terrible experience. Location is good but there are so many others to choose from pick another one. I have had better experiences staying at budget hotels like red roof inn. Stay away!
20,The room was cold the bathroom fixtures were all corroded someone had tampered with the smoke detector. It looked like it had been covered with wet toilet paper. I got charged more than double what this room normally cost because a CES convention was in town. I have had nicer rooms at a super 8. 19th floor and you have to go all the way to 1 for a cup of coffee.🤣 The only reason I didn’t gave it one star was because the Blue Man Group Show was so outstanding. I just wish I stayed somewhere else and came over to see it.
30,I did not like the parking. It was entirely too far. Hotel staff did not help with directions to my room further adding to my frustration. I ordered food to my room and the hotel did not let the driver in. I was told I had to come downstairs to get my food at the main entrance. The staff did not telle her name or give me directions as to how to get to where she was and rudely hung up the phone. I never found the staff or my food. I was livid. I have no intention of staying here again. I will stay elsewhere when I come back to town next month. The staff definitely needs customer service training. This was a horrible experience to say the least.
30,Stayed at the Luxor because of the good rates. The hotel is fine if you are 25 and partying on the strip all night and can sleep through a warzone. The rooms are clean and many are getting remodeled. Hotel isn't bad but it seems to attract a clientele that is looking for cheap and just need to sleep of night of drunken debauchery. If that is not your scene any more than go next door to MB. It costs more but you will be able to sleep.
40,We stayed for one night. Check-in was a bit long. Please download their app for quicker check-in. We loved our two queen bed room overlooking the view of Mandala Bay. The beds were so soft and comfortable. Everything you need for a short stay was available. We recommend staying here.
40,The staff is wonderful. Aside from the managers and front desk staff. Was never told or given any information whatsoever regarding anything in the hotel the location of it prices nothing. You had to stop at a desk and feel pressured to buy some thing just to get information and had I not seen them? There are three major exhibit I would’ve never known about because they do not advertise them nor offer guests any incentive to go. Also not having room service at such a big hotel was kind of a bummer. But be prepared to spend money because the cheapest meal is about $20 anywhere you go breakfast lunch or dinner
50,The Luxor was an excellent choice I’ll be coming back in June for my birthday and already have my room booked .. excellent Food courts/restaurants and slot Machines as well and a spacious and clean room.
50,My room was clean and relaxing I had the best sleep every night with a comfy bed and fluffy pillows.  The hotel is clean and easy to get around.  The Backstage Deli has great sandwiches.  The machines are plenty and the variety made it interesting.
30,I’m a frequent traveler and I have never been cursed out by housekeeping for wanting clean washcloths and towels in my room. On a recent visit to Luxor in Las Vegas after passing housekeeping in hallway we informed staff that we were leaving upon our return approximately 9pm our room was not serviced as we requested. Housekeeping cursed at my husband after he called and complained. He then notified front desk and complained. We have stayed at Luxor many times in the past and it was my husband’s favorite hotel in Las Vegas. Other than that incident the rest of the hotel staff was friendly.
30,After it took 1.5 hours to check in the staff gave us the wrong room. After standing in line for another 15 min they gave us the right room. However once inside we turned on the AC and it was terribly noisy. We were so tired of that we just had to endure the loud noise and tried to sleep as much as possible.
20,They added a $35.00 fee per night. Not disclosed until check-in. How is this legal? The food was okay. Blueman show was good. A nice walk to other hotels and shopping. You do not have to leave the hotel.
50,Everything was great! No issues and staff was nice. I will probably stay here again in the future. I didn’t get my room cleaned every day but when I needed some toilet paper I received it quickly after requesting it.
10,When you get to your room and see their is no menu and call down you are informed that since covid Luxor does not do any room service. Someone tell me please what does room service have to do with covid since all the hotel opened by last april????? plus he fac they tell you can order food from one of the rest. and pic up... bull.... 90 percent are closed by 7 pm including what should be their 24 hour coffee shop Pryamid.. The only food place i could find at the luxor to take out food was the public house and i don't really want to eat nochos and cheese an hamburgers before bed. shame on you mgm family... your other hotels seem to room service and other options... i am sending out an email to my whole company about this..... also putting it all over social media
40,It's an iconic hotel and overall experience was fabulous. Easy to walk around the strip and enjoy the sites. Parking onsite needs some improvement during busy times and would have loved to know in advance of promos and discounts available - should have done more research in advance! But family loved the hotel and experience.
50,it was kind of a quick decision last minute. My son and I decided check a show in Vegas and we landed on the Blue Man Group. Last time I saw that show was at lease 18 years ago. Still tons of fun as I remember and from there on it was a very pleasant stay.
10,Room wasn’t more than a mattress/box spring on the floor with no closet not even a bottle of water on arrival. Bathroom had visible mold in shower smoke odors throughout the entire casino. By far the worst of any casino we have experienced in Vegas nothing else close….CES convention had the casino hotels booked full so we couldn’t even switch to a cleaner place never again will we even walk in the door
50,Had a blast and the hotel was very conveniently located near everything we wanted to do. Great restaurants very clean friendly staff    I have to type 200 characters but I'm not going to gush about the place. It was good I'd give it a minimum of 9/10 on some days and a 10/10 on best days.
40,Very nice location. Was able to walk to a lot of the other casinos. Nice soaking tub. Nice sofa area. The Pyramid Cafe had a great breakfast. Need a coffee maker in the rooms. The bed was real lumpy. Needs new mattress.
50,I had the greatest time here at the Luxor I spent more of my time in the Luxor I still need to see mor so I will definitely be back as soon as I can staff were very helpful with any issues that I had food was great
10,I talked to the front desk to a lady called Karen terrible service…. 2 hr to send someone to fix the TV in my room Its now 9pm so I wont wait until 11pm I asked to change my room and she didn't wanted also wanted t9 talk to a manager and she asked me to come physically to the front desk because managers dont talk to guests in their rooms…. Can you believe it?
30,I’ve stayed at the Luxor many times and it’s ok it’s convenient if you’re going to allegiant stadium but most of the elevators really need to be updated you feel like you might not make it up to your room if you’re on a higher floor because they shake so much. Also would be really nice if the rooms had at least a coffee maker in them since they no longer offer microwaves and you have to special request a refrigerator I feel like there’s no real amenities at this hotel. The food court I think can also use some updating in the vendors or at least add some more.
40,Very good hotel experience. All aspects were at expectations or above. The only drawback: paying for parking as a hotel guest. 18 dollars a day. Probably the norm but still I do not like paying for parking when I am staying at the said facility....
30,I was offered a room upgrade for an extra $35 night to their “newly” renovated room in the west towers. Room was spacious but the room was maybe renovated 5+ years ago. Tables were run down furniture had stains faucets were filthy bathroom needed a deep clean and mop toilet wasn’t even flushed prior to us checking in.
10,Would not recommend. Check in process took over an hour. Luggage was lost by the bell hop. Never staying here again! Staff was also not friendly and lacking an understanding of caring for the customers. Choose any other property!
10,I was very upset with the way my trim was handled. I have never stayed in a hotel that was musty and dirty. A better cleaning staff is needed and management. I called the service desk and housekeeping several times and nothing was done. They sprayed something in the carpet. Didn’t work smell was still there.
20,The pharaoh cafe was subpar. My wife’s sand which was good but they did forgot to add the avacado mayo which the sand which was built around. I had the pharaohs pheast and the whole thing except the hash browns either tasted like nothing or was disgusting. I was in the middle of writing a review but my wife stopped me and said you all were just having a bad morning. So I let it be. The room was good and you even had the congratulations To the newly weds was a nice touch. But the AC was either bad or just poor quality as if you walked around or turned on the shower for a few minutes the whole room heated up and then you were sweating for an hour as it cooled down. Could be poor air circulation as well. When you drained the bath it would occasionally cause some gurgling noise the. The bathroom would smell gross to say the least. Which is quite unfortunate as when I stayed 3-4 years ago I had a great time which is why I booked it for my honeymoon. Odds are I won’t stay at Luxor again unless something changes.
50,First time in vegas we expected allot of fun but not this much fun! Staying at luxor was a Great idea! Allot to do and everyone was so freindly. I will be booking luxor and cant wait to expirence this again!
30,My total for a 4 night stay was supposed to be $543 but When I went to check I’n I was told my new total was $713 so I really felt like I was lied to and when I told them that my total was supposed to be $543 all they did was say it says her that it’s $713 and was never really given and explanation as to why the rate changed
30,The Hotel was probably amazing at one time but it definitely is showing it’s age. The check in app did not work for us so we still had to stand in line. The elevators are a bit sketchy to ride. It’s an ok place to stay
10,When we checked into the suite there was fecal matter smeared on the front of the toilet. When housekeeping was alert and requested to service the room (with NO ‘do not disturb sign’ on the door…they skipped the room and ignored the request.
10,rooms has not coffee maker not refri not glasses. the tv control has not batteries so you cant no used the tv  they want to save energy.  i called for the batteries nobody come i had to get them by myself
50,Had a good time at the hotel. Check in was long as mobile check in wouldn’t work for me. Had a good room was clean and spacious. Hotel was easy to get around and had adequate dining. Went to see the blue man group was a very good show. Would rate this hotel better than expected and was good value for the money.
10,This was such a bad experience unfortunately. We upgraded to get a bigger room. It was noisy. Downgraded and got a more noisy room. Upgraded again and got punished with the most dirty room. Then I asked it to be cleaned and was asked if I did it my self. There were chips and peanuts/nuts on the floor and I have nut allergi. There was a strangers hair in the sink and the ceiling had a whole in it. Looks like it is going to fall down. There is dirt in the ventilator in the bathroom and in the aircon. We can’t heat up the room which is freezing due to the very bad smell coming from it. I was told the cleaners might not have time to come and clean. I was told I could always find another hotel with my family if I was not happy. The manager didn’t have time to come and talk to me and have a look at the pictures from the room. Maybe they thought we just wanted something extra which we didn’t want. We honestly just wanted to have fun a nice clean room and go gamble. I was almost crying when I was accused to make the mess myself. Felt like we paid more to be punished. I wouldn’t ask people to stay in this hotel and we have one more night we can’t get out of.
50,stayed in the pyramid best stay ever at Luxor. loved the slanted windows but the view was better. Room was clean staff friendly and the wonkavator was great. Would stay again easily. The only downside is the buffet not worth the price but the deli had the best Italian sandwiches I have ever had.
50,Staff was amazing  only issues was elevator not working that goes from food court to downstairs. Only one elevator connects those levels. Just a bet upsetting since we have a stroller / wagon. Which made process a bit more challenging.
40,The staff was very professional and were all amazing to talk with and work with because when we checked it there was a lot of people and the staff was so professional and quick with answering questions and personal while trying to get all guests checked in as quick as possible.
50,Had an awesome experience. Staff was very nice and helpful loved the service made everything so easy. Rooms nice and clean. Definitely going back again. Plus close to strip and raiders stadium. Thank you Luxor and staff for the awesome and fun experience
30,In our hallway to our room was a huge dumpster under a huge hole in the ceiling. Then mold in the shower. Wallpaper falling/peeling off in the hallways. The key pads every now and then work with your phone. Try and use the key they give u and still doesn’t work. Had to get off one elevator to go one another because we couldn’t get the key to work to go to our floor.
40,The Stay was good. Check in took 30 min due to long lines. The bed was really good. The rooms was kind of old with no fridge. The bathroom was clean but didn't have a bath tub. Please renovate the rooms in the Pyramid.
30,Could only Mobil check in one room of 2. Had to stand in long line to get second room. Took up 3-5 minutes to get hot water for shower. Also sink took as much time to get the hot water in order to shave.
10,We had a horrible experience from not being safe and protected by the security team and being rationally characterized for being person of color. First they were told there was an argument with people and security right away came and surrounded our table which they assume it was our table because we black people. When they realized it was 2 table down from us. The second incident a Homeless guy tried to steal my brothers phone security took for ever to come out to us and when they finally did the assistant manager of the security told us they knew who the homeless guy was because he is not allowed in the hotel/casino but yet they allow him to still come in and walk around the hotel/casino. How are we supposed to feel safe and protected when they can stop one guy from coming in and stop him from stealing from costumers.
10,I expected a 5 star hotel for $500 usd but got a 2 star room unclean and dust gathered beside bed and floor not vacuumed. Furnishings are shabby and old. Overpriced and I feel cheated. Had to wait 1 hr for valet parking when checking in and 1 hr upon check out. Had to wait in line to check in so add another 40 min...took almost 2 hrs before we got our key.
50,The inside structure of Luxor is very impressive even 30 years after. Very laid back environment and different entertainment (like bodies Titanic and Tutankhamen) experience. If you don't mind walking is just 20 minutes walk from the strip center.
20,Uncleaned rooms with unfriendly service. Staff felt did not want to be at work. Had turd floating in toilet Could have used better trained staff and management. Would pass on this hotel in the future.......
10,I waited on the phone for ten minutes for house keeping just so the lady hung up on me she did not want to hear me.over all was ok but I will not stay there again my wife and I did not like the experience .
50,Although the casino area was packed the room was quiet comfortable and clean. We were only in town for Adele New Years Eve concert and Vegas regardless was filled with people. But we didn’t have an issue checking in on the app and checking out as well.
20,I been there plenty of times I never had an issue. Similar to that day. I feel the quality has gone down that used to be my best get away hotel instead of these high end casinos. I love the vibe there the People but after this stay I feel like I will considered some where else .
40,We liked staying here as the price for location is perfect. I did not like the elevator as we had issues with it stopping on the 8th floor and had to have assistance with it. Other than that we enjoyed our stay.
20,I would not stay here again. The hotel is old and not clean. I paid almost the same price here per night as Pallazo. We stayed with our kids at Pallazo for three nights in the beginning of our trip and they loved it. Service staff cleanliness and food were awesome. I just booked one night at Luxor because my husband wanted to stay at this hotel. Never again. We were checked into a completely dirty room and even the 2nd room was not clean. Food was not good. If I could I would have checked out right away but we were forced to spend the night as the room charges for last minute booking in other preferred hotels was over $400/ night.
20,Had to wait for a room well after the 3pm check in time the room smelled awful there was a yappy dog that woke us up at 7am each morning-even after complaining to security the television channels didn't work. The buffet is not very good definitely not worth $35 for breakfast. The crepe station is gone as well. The room was fairly inexpensive though which is a plus. Parking is free if you are pearl level for MGM rewards.
10,This has been by far the WORST hotel experience I have had and I have already started telling friends and family to avoid this hotel and casino. Not only did we have to wait 45 minutes to just check in but when we got to our room the bathroom was filthy outdated and the beds sank right in the middle. I couldn’t even use the room phone to call them because it was broken.. We decided to go downstairs and ask for another room but when they gave us the new room number the elevators for that section of floors was broken so we couldn’t get to our new room. We had to go back to the desk in line and ask for a THIRD room. We finally make it into our new room only to realize we had no cell connection. I couldn’t call my family or friends during our whole trip and instead had to FaceTime using wifi to reach them. Lastly while I was working in the hotel room the alarm system went off for 30 minutes. I was in a meeting presenting and had to end it early because the speakers were so loud. Everyday there was something new and disappointing about this place. They truly made our stay extremely difficult.
10,Check-in takes forever. Manager completely unhelpful. The room reeked of cigarettes and looked like it had endured one party too many. No toilet paper in the bathroom. Public House has possibly the worst food in Vegas.
20,It wasn't the worst. The room was very dusty which means the cleaning is very superficial. When I say dusty I mean visible chunks all along the head boards and lamps etc. Not fridge or coffee maker in room. This was a room block for a stay and play youth hockey tournament - not a good fit. The casino floor was heavily smokey and perfumed more so than the other casinos we went into.
10,Checked in on the 30th dropped bags off in the room arrived back at 3:00 am to discover filthy/dirty bed linen with hairs lipstick and stains. The manager offered to compensate $100 for food; food I want clean bed linens. Was brought a bag of linens at 4:00 am that was also soiled. There is so much more I could say but I’m still furious how this played out. I got no rest and my trip was ruined. Lastly I would say this is not an experience I expected especially since I paid nearly $400 a night I’m writing their corporate office because I want to be compensated for my stay.
50,Wonderful experience and friendly staff! I highly recommend staying at this location. I plan on coming back again. The room was clean and we had a wonderful view. It's a short walk to all of the other casinos.
50,We had a great experience on this holidays  we accommodate at the Luxor Hotel and the room was nice clean and confortable . I always look the Luxor because is the best option when you make your numbers.
50,This stay was a very comfortable relaxing stay….Very clean well kept —very well located and friendly professional staff Rooms clean well maintained. The food court was well maintained and provided great surface
10,well let’s start with the room they are old and not very clean. With all the money they make at the casino you would think that they would invested into some nicer rooms. I actually saw a dog crap on the floor at least twice during my stay. The parking was a nightmare. I do not recommend this place whatsoever. I will never stay there again.
40,We usually stay at Luxor they give us the maximum of resort credit and free play. We love to walk the strip and travel in between resorts and find that the Luxor is perfectly located for our preference.
20,Outdated really basic . Motel feel at premium prices. Nothing special beyond the lobby and the elevators definitely need some maintenance. Stayed in a premium pryamid room but wasn't as luxurious as we were expecting. Also traveling with a dog very pricey $50 extra per night and not very convenient long walk to go outside for the dog .
10,The shower was covered in someone elses pubic hair when I arrived. The room was not cleaned and when I called they promised to send someone in to reclean and they didn’t. I hope I can sway someone from booking this hotel. Hallways are dirty and smelly. Stuff is rude and elevators barely work; you literally wait for 20 by the elevators to get anywhere. Horrible
30,Room was pretty good... Air conditioner was the only real issue. Kept turning off on it's on. But looked like it had a motion detector so we never said anything. But last day it said off but was running.  All of the staff we dealt with were great.  Casino was not the best but not the worst
20,Worst experience I have had in Vegas our room smelled of cigarettes bathroom had the smell of backed up sewage and the carpet in the hallway just outside of the room was soaking wet. I first found this out when I almost fell onto the ground because the tile was soaked from the carpet. I called and they did nothing second time coming up girlfriend almost took a header. Once again called and they said they would try to fix it and if it wasn’t done right away “we would have to just deal with it” seriously what kind of customer service is that.
40,Cleaning staff were friendly and helpful! Always gave fresh towels and cleaned up beautifully. Have and would stay here again. Wish Luxor hosted a cirque de soleil show- that would be awesome and would bring me to Vegas more.
30,Nice stay!    Super friendly hotel staff!    Guest parking could be better...  Need clearer direction (go up the ramp!) Parking at the Luxor is limited and the attendants aren't overly helpful.    I stayed in a room that has not yet been renovated and it was still just fine.. very clean and well maintained.... so don't let the elevators scare you! The elevators are a little rough.. not clean throughout my stay they have some graffiti like markings that feel a little poor.    Still nice and a good price give it a try!
50,We go to Vegas twice a year. Sue Laforce took great care of us and had everything set up for us. Sue Laforce is a great asset to Luxor. I am all about customer service and she goes far and beyond to take care of us.
30,Online check-in wasn't the best experience through the mobile application if you have more than one room. It only checks you in for one room and you'll have to go through the check-in line at the hotel lobby for the second one. And there is no explanation about it through the mobile application upon check-in as well. One lady attempted to assist me with the check-in at the hotel lobby. Except her the rest of them didn't appear to be very friendly. The room was nice and spacious (Premium Tower Room) but there were noises(loud music and noises) coming from outside throughout the night. The wall is thin and the room next to our left has the water running and other noises (seems to come from the bathroom) through the wee hours and at dawn. Noises can be heard from the hallway outside of our room as well.
10,For a 4 star hotel they charged  $25 for a refrigerator in the hotel room  $25 for a manual wheelchair for my disabled daughter it is provided as a courtesy in all other hotels  45min wait at bell desk  House keeping never serviced our room and it was disgusting they didn't change the room and made us wait outside for 2hours before housekeeping even showed up.  The exit that says Uber Rideshare is controlled by the hotel-taxi mafia and make you walk a mile outside of the Luxor premises if you want to catch an Uber
40,We don’t ask for much. We used the phone app to check in and that was very convenient. We had trouble with the prepaid self parking and ended up double paying. We didn’t interact with many employees other than restaurant workers. Was a little surprised at how expensive food and drinks are. Loved Blue Man Group.
10,I never leave reviews but… even as a 25 year old who doesn’t need much and likes to party this was trashy. Small rundown old rooms. No different from like an old Holiday Inn (and we stayed in the tower which was supposed to be nicer). Always HOT in common areas. Always smell of weed in common areas and halls. Guests are rowdy 24/7. Some are even aggressive. It is loud everywhere. Few desirable food options. Wifi sucks. Elevator buttons rarely work correctly. It is not located close to fun things on the strip like shopping at Caesar’s Palace or Aria and Bellagio. No convenience store near.
50,Had not been to Vegas in 16 years. The Luxor was a great hotel and casino with friendly staff and clean room. The connecting hotels with access to additional stores and restaurants was a plus. Would definitely stay again.
50,The Luxor Hotel is worth the stay simply for the first reason there is so much beautiful Egyptian decor all around. Exploring the Luxor is exciting. Lots of shops and places to eat. I would recommend the king size pyramid room so you can have a comfortable bed with a gorgeous view. The customer service is excellent. The roll out beds feel as comfortable as the king size bed. The buffet was filled with variety and yummy food.
40,I really enjoyed the fact that the hotel had so many amenities. The house keepers did a great job of checking the room each day. I had no issues with staff but I felt like I didn’t deal with staff that much. It was like no one approached us for anything. Overall my experience was great and I would come back in the future.
20,Our room was in a location that was very loud. Our shower was clogged and flooding everywhere. When I called to ask for help the phone was so static that I couldn’t hear. They did not come up to fix my problem. Staying somewhere else next time!
30,I am a Travel Agent so I was really looking forward to our stay and finding a good hotel to recommend to my customers but I'm not sure if I would recommend to everyone. We had a stroller & the elevators were down so it was a nightmare. We had to have security escort us everytime we needed to get to the 4th floor or the Mandalay Bay. If you don't have a stroller or wheelchair then it shouldn't be a problem. The room was ok but I was disappointed our sink didn't drain properly when we arrived and there wasn't a coffee pot microwave or refrigerator. I need a fridge for bottles but I didn't want to pay extra so we had to use the ice bucket. On a positive note the bed were comfortable & there was a lot to do in the hotel. I especially enjoyed the King Tut Exhibit.
10,Disturbing uncleaned rooms. Will never visit Luxor again. My expectations were different than what I expected. The rooms were so dirty that I wasn't even comfortable taking a shower. In the sink there was nasal discharge. You could see hairs everywhere
10,Was told by the receptionist(who happened to be the manager)she was going to upgrade my room and take off resort fees and still ended up paying more just for a dirty room. This place was a absolute joke
50,Nice rooms and clean rooms. Lots to do at hotel they had exhibits and many shoes available. The look of the hotel is very unique and stylish. Really liked the tram system as well and the hotel had a good location.
10,Dirty rooms. So loud you can't sleep. Ridiculously expensive. Better off sleeping in your car. Worst trip I have ever experienced in Vegas. Couldn't be worse if they were trying to suck. I will never stay here again.
10,Mold smell in the bathroom and room I stayed in. The view was horrible. I am allergic to mold. Lots of construction at the site. The line every single day to check in was ridiculously long. They would have 1 teller there for 100 person line. Just stupid.
10,Room was disgusting and uncomfortable. It was unsanitary and horrible for my family and I. They didn’t care when we told them there was mold and blood in the bathroom. The sheets were dirty and pillows smelled bad.
20,Room was unclean on check-in. Spotty make up service. Tub was full of dirty water when we checked in with used soap on ledge. Missed making up room one day. Last day housekeeping left trash and a used glove on my nightstand.
50,We had a blast at Luxor! The hotel staff was super helpful and welcoming. The room was amazing which made my wife and daughter very happy which made for a happy and pleasant trip. The front desk personnel went out of their way to make sure the experience was pleasant and the check-in quick and easy. The cleanliness was impeccable and the view great! We are sure to come back for a longer stay! Thanks!
50,The electronic checkin is awesome. It’s like you’re home. No real need to interact with any of the staff. The one thing I don’t like. The fact the buffet closes at 3 pm. By time you check in there’s no buffet open. Then you are forced into the food courts of the casinos. The restaurants in the area are ok. However plan ahead. You’re gonna need a reservation.
10,The place is falling apart. The building is old and low quality. Walls are paper thing you can't rest due to noise.  They charge the hotel guests 18$ for parking which was full. I had to loiter around for 45 minutes to find a spot
50,Went between Christmas and new years. Had a nice stay very clean room. Wish the room had a fridge. Tram at Hotel is very useful to save yourself steps. Great shows at this hotel. Elevator ride is interesting experience.
40,Nice property near the strip at an affordable price. Rooms are not the fanciest but are clean. Rooms expectingly lack fridge or microwave. Plenty options on site or nearby. Would stay again but maybe not as long of a stay (5nights)
40,Nice  clean comfortable . I had Read articles about it being haunted but we Didn’t experience any hauntings. It was a VERY LARGE PLACE So be prepared to walk ! It took us a minute to figure out self parking .
30,The hotel was very nice would stay there again. Only problem was the check in I mentioned in this survey. Good prices inside the hotels could be cheaper. Food court seemed expensive. Besides that the visit was very nice.
30,Very disappointed. Room was clean but in serious need of upgrade. First time I’ve seen a hotel room with no coffee pot mini fridge or USB ports. Rooms are tired & worn. Very difficult experience from our stay at the Hilton Grand Vacation Club. Would not stay here again. All I kept thinking is that a cheap refresh would go a very long way here. If all you care about is a place to sleep it’s fine….
20,Our suite was exceptionally dirty and outdated. Hair on towels floor not vacuumed could wipe visible dirt off the dresser. Had I been able to book a room somewhere else I would have. During our stay there was a person having a seizure off to the side of the casino floor. Three security personnel were standing off to the side of the family were joking around and unprofessional. The next day when my husband was carrying our pillows out to our car parked in the garage he was detained by security that pushed him against a car and his hands were held behind his back while he tried explaining he was a hotel guest but he couldn't get our room key out of his pocket due to being detained. I called down to security and they took my information but there was no follow through from Juan that said he would look into it.  We had stayed here earlier this year and had a good experience so we were definitely disappointed in this trip.
10,The Luxor is a dump avoid at all costs dingy tired dirty depressing should be bulldozed flat even the employees dont want to be there. Everything just as expensive as other place on the strip but far lower quality. Zero stars had to put one to complete the review.
50,todo accesible buen servicio y sobre todo un excelente ambiente para pasarla bien. Recomendado    everything accessible good service and above all an excellent environment to have a good time. recommended
30,Bathroom sink was clogged upon our arrival. We called housekeeping twice to no avail. The next morning we were awaken by a call from the engineer. He called to say he was on his wY up to fix the sink. We declined. We were still in bed and we were due to check out that morning. So at that point there was no reason for the engineer to intrude.
50,Great stay. Love the hotel. Love the casino. Too bad the price of parking is different in the app and when you actually check in. Its also not good the days we stay the buffet is close. And when we encounter problem with the hotel when water in the room stop. Nobody even comp’d us or tried to help. Which they will tell you not they’re fault which is understandable but if it were them staying in the hotel and encounter the same thing they are the ones who wants compensation.
50,My family had a great stay at the Luxor. Checkin was easy to do from my phone no waiting in line. Our rooms were really nice and clean and comfortable beds. Easy access to the strip. Great experience at the restaurants and casino
20,Luxor was not willing to work with the airplane customers who were stuck no additional mon or food. In my case no additional medicine as well as my husband’s. So very disappointing not sure but I believe they would’ve left you out in the cold
20,The 1st room we got does not have electricity from any wall outlet in the living room neither of the TV refrigerate or lamp in the room works. No other room is available on that day. We have to move to another room after 1 day of stay.    On the 2nd day no room service was done. Uncollected trash in the room but no clean towers. We called for room service and was told someone would bring towers and collect trash. But no one showed up.    On the 3rd day the little tool my son uses to take in and out his contact lenses was missing after the room service. We have to drive out trying to buy a new one. It was hard to find one after mid night. When we desperately returned to hotel around 2am we were told to park at Mandalay Bay because Luxor's parking lot was full. We had to walk from Mandalay Bay parking to Luxor in the 2am coldness and did the reverse early next day morning to buy the tool my son needs. I feel my vacation was ruined.
10,Dirtiest room I've seen in 22 yrs of travelling. Yellow stains on bed sheets dirty carpets. Wobbly elevators. Everything is old smelly and disgusting. We paid for the 'Stay Well' rate which basically was a wall mounted humidifier with air freshener smell that tried to hide the stink in the room. We left in 5 minutes asked for a refund which they gave. Dragged our luggage to Mandalay Bay next door which is much better.    Don't stay at Luxor. Many other options in Vegas.
40,The rooms in the tower are always nice comfortable bed! The shower was plugged but they fixed it the day I mentioned the problem. I love the views from the tower rooms as well. Overall a great stay and will visit again.
50,We have chosen Luxor for our last 3 stays in Vegas. The Hotel is truly unique we like the expansive space in the middle the Casino ceilings are high and feels very open. It is a square so easy to navigate. We like the location with Mandalay Bay Delano wonderful restaurant and bar options and tram to Excalibur and the Tropicana intersection. Mlife App makes the Check-in/out process seemless. Thank you!
10,The architecture of this hotel is amazing and stands out on the Las Vegas skyline but inside is a disaster from check in to check out. I used their mobile app to check in but this didn’t work properly so I ended up waiting in their ridiculously long line. A large number of people got in the elevator and nobody’s key would work so we were trapped until the elevator doors opened and we escaped. The tv in our room didn’t work. We had the misfortune of having a room right above the East Tower entrance where they play “pleasant music” which we had to listen to all night. The Luxor parking lot is horrible and isn’t large enough to meet the demand. We were charged for parking in this lot twice when we only stayed for one night with one car so we had to wait in that ridiculously long line again because the Luxor is not properly staffed. We were told to use our room key to exit but of course none of the keys worked. Need I go on? Many large Las Vegas hotels have problems like these but not to thus extent. We will never stay at the Luxor again.
50,Nicely situational between Mandalay Bay and Excalibur with the MGM rewards means you can take advantage of three hotels without leaving the buildings. The Luxor's Egyptian theme is unique in Vegas and provides a fun yet cozy experience.
20,"Theft in room and no action what so ever so far.  Room service was missed one day and there was no ""no disturb sign"". Casino floor was full of smoke which made us and kids uncomfortable even when crossing it."
40,The first room we got had a bad smell and because of that reason my brother got allergie. We called front desk and they were fast and friendly and gave us a different room made things way better and we had a good time
10,This place is worse than Motel 6. They don’t provide a coffee maker. Who is ever heard of a hotel without a coffee maker in the room? The TV is horrible. I didn’t even have HBO. They did not have a microwave or a fridge raider.
10,I stayed here a few times already and they treat you like they are doing you a favor the rooms are not great and you pay a lot for a suite and if you want to stay more nights they make you go downstairs and do all the process of checking in again and they charge you way more the receptionist or front desk do not treat you well they don’t care about your needs and basically ignore you the machine stole money from us in the casino and nobody came to help us ever horrible experience and terrible customer service
10,Horrible customer service had to switch rooms after the first night due to A/C not working. The staff did nothing to accommodate the A/C not working. Switched rooms on the next night only to have the water shutoff for an extended period of time. The rooms in the towers are very noisy the doors to the rooms do not drowned the hallway chatter from other guests. There were also TV issues most channels did not work what seemed to be due to not being able to connect to the cable tv or satellite provider.    STAY AWAY FROM THE LUXOR.
20,The check-in process take too long. I didn't understand why they made you pay for self parking when you're already paying to stay there also when I go out it was asking to pay for parking each time I don’t understand why room card is not programmed as per the stay.
50,Kuddos all the staff will be back soon! I thought I will be having a hard time. Especially the check in the line is super long but staff are friendly accommodating and fast checking out WiFi is great’
50,This was a fantastic spot for a quick trip. Staff was friendly and it was close to some awesome trips and exhibits. The titanic and king tut ones were especially cool. Easy walking distance to coke/m&m/Hershey's.
30,The majority of the dealers were rude and not friendly to play with. I never travel to Vegas planning on winning. I actually enjoy playing but not here. You would think when people are tipping you that you would be nicer. I will never stay there again. This is the first time I have had a problem with a MGM property. This one missed the mark all the way!
40,Stayed here for the first time over Christmas 2022. Was pleasantly suprised with the size and layout of the dual queen room. Elevators or lol inclinators ( they tilt up to 39 degrees) took some getting use to. Definitely worth the price. Good selection of food on site. I recomend Diablos.
10,Bad from the start. We had to circle the property twice just to find parking. Long walk from parking with luggage and bags. Once we’re inside Luxor we can smell the bad odor. Many bad signs and we force ourselves to stay and we regret every second we were there.
10,I've had better experiences at a Red Roof Inn. From the hours long check in / check out line and the downright rude front desk service to the smelly dilapidated rooms and elevator death traps this visit was a massive disappointment. Glad we were able to have fun elsewhere but would not come back to Luxor (or MGM).
20,My husband and I were checked in at Luxor from December 22 - 28 Room 10129. On our first day I used the shower and I am so upset because of the tub is draining slow when I checked the drain it is clogged full of hair. The cabinet and drawers are dusty and sticky. I don’t have time to call the attention of the housekeeping because of our planned itinerary. Second day I am expecting that there will be an improvement unfortunately it is still the same. I tried to call the housekeeping department but no answer. So it is Christmas day and I don’t think the cleaners know my complaints so I took my time to go see the front desk the guy is very apologetic and in fact he gave me new king suite room at the west tower which is not good yes it is clean but it is too far from our previous room that could cause more inconvenience to us. I went back to the front desk and informed him that it will not work out for us instead just inform the housekeeping about my concern. Plus do you know that there are no slippers available in Luxor? I asked the lady at the front and she said it is unavailable so strange right? Being very busy with thousands of guests everyday they don’t have enough supply of slippers for their gusts on this holiday season. Guess what we are in our fourth day and my issue wasn’t resolved at all. I checked the drain of the tub and it is still the same plus the trash bin in the toilet wasn’t change how do I knew? My liner still sticks in the plastic. So gross and very unhygienic. My husband asked me not to stress about it because it will ruin our stay. To sum it up I don’t think the room is really ready for us. I will not accept the reason that Luxor ia overwhelmed with the number of guests Luxor should be ready in any ways.Don’t get me wrong there was one and only part that I really appreciate them mobile check out is the best. Thank you Luxor! I hope you will improve your service.
40,Fun trip everything was expensive casino was nice could never get a drink while aging. Rooms outdated and you don't leave water in them. We have to go down and pay $ 5 for a bottle of water. My husband had to pay $18 for a beer. Food wad expensive also.
40,Use my MyVEGAS points and did a one night stay. Front desk was very helpful and offered us an upgrade. The room was clean for the most part. Plumbing probably needs to be updated since it is an older building. The sinks took a while to drain. Our room had the large tub and that was nice! We had dinner at Diablo’s Cantina and that was really good! Check out was easy. I just used my app to check out. I would definitely recommend staying here!
30,As a former Vegas resident still enjoy the city but prices have been going tru the roof and service has been getting worse if paying for the Vegas experience this wasn’t it!! Maybe in the future not to distant.
30,"Nancy by check in has a huge attitude treated me and my wife like we didn't belong because we asked for help finding our room she said she can't move from that spot and said she can explain I said ma'am we can't find it we looked we asked multiple people and keep going in a circle we are clearly missing something we are on a schedule to get married we just need some help please. HER LITERAL NEXT STEP said she's calling security. She asked for the room keys and looked surprised when I game them to her then demanded ""give me your id sir"". Her tone was harsh and then security corrected her over the radio by saying ""why are you calling us that's guest services""....then the manager comes and she walks us and I told her that we felt like we were treated very poorly by Nancy like we were feeling like we were about to be kicked out for asking for help she then gets defensive and says "" she can't move from that spot so what do you want from her"" at that point I made the decision to never go to this resort again. I'm a store manager and would never allow a guest to tell me my employee made them feel uninvited and unwelcome on a honeymoon without addressing that feeling first and helping them recover and mind you it was not a regular room and paid a lot more for what we got the tub would back into the shower and took about a hour to go down but Nancy really was way way way worse it was the tone for me and my wife that really sucked."
50,My family’s Christmas vacation was a wonderful experience starting with our stay at the Luxor. We were 3 different families with 3 different stays all there. We all experienced a great time there. Will definitely do this again and at the Luxor. Thank you for everything!
10,Super dirty rooms. The housekeeping is a joke. We had hair on towels insects in the tub and constant knocking and noises from the room connected to us. The first room we checked in had a broken television so we were moved to a room on the lowest floor. The AC did not work in that room but we were too tired to keep complaining. They did not have comforters either. There were just two sheets on the bed. They gave us complimentary ticket to use for drinks and restaurants next day but all the options had bad reviews. We tried to go to one place - Diablo something but they said there is a 20 min wait despite there were literally four tables occupied. We gave our complimentary ticket back to the front desk.
30,Some of the rooms need to be upgraded. I hade broken bathroom tile and the caulk was peeling. The Buffet is closed on Tues and Weds and it closes way too early. The Buffett hours are really short as well. The hours are only 8am-3pm
10,After having stayed at the luxor many times I will never stay there again from poor attitudes from staff to the ceiling falling in chunks on me in the shower and being treated like it was nothing the rooms and staff were the worst I've ever experienced never again.
40,We decided to go to Las Vegas for Christmas. We call the MGM rewards and they offer a very attractive rate. The bedroom was simple but clean and the staff very friendly. The location is Ok. Easy to get the tram to arrive at other hotels.
20,Rooms are dated was given accessible room. Bathroom flooded after shower. Bathroom latch was broken. Was allocated a room on the first floor which was hard to locate. Nobody in the luxor staff was able to navigate us properly
40,Easy room and parking access. Clean Casino with a variety of games. Only recommendation would be a better ventilation air conditioning system for there was a smell of smoke in the air from people smoking and a bit stuffy.
10,Smelly musty room elevator not working no staff in sight to give us guidance on the best alternative way to reach our floor (15th floor) security fee was not refunded altho the check in clerk informed us that it will be
30,The mattress was very squeaky and lumpy. The sheets were dirty and there’s no coffee pot or microwave. Not good for a flight attendant when we have to carry food with us on overnight trips with no fridge to put it in. The staff was very friendly with great personalities
50,Great time! We could walk and see so many things from the location. My daughter loved every bit of the little vacation. Come during a raiders game was busy but the staff was so helpful!! Thanks for everything you guys do!
50,I've come out to Vegas a few time now. I asked my kids where they would like to go for Christmas. They said they want to see what I've been talking about that I saw. We spent 5 nights at the Luxor. They saved me some money when we checked in & checked out. Everyone was completely friendly & helpful.
30,The resort atmosphere is great but expect to spend a lot of money. Everything is overpriced and none of the hotel apps work. Don't expect to win any money playing casino games. They are more for the experience but no one wins JACKPOTS or real money.
30,The hotel needs updating. I'm disappointed that they haven't banned smoking in this hotel/casino it smells like a trashy strip club everywhere inside. The walkways are a death trap. Elevator = washer machine.
10,there old dog poop in our room under the chair. DISGUSTING just shows how they dont clean their rooms or dont clean areas of the rooms. Also weird intermittent drilling sounds during the night. gross
10,We were checked into a room that had no working A/C - and this was known at the time we were checked in. Spent 2 nights in a hot room. Maintenance was called but could do nothing. We ended up moving to a new room after 2nd night to get working A/C. At check-out I asked if there could be some kind of comp for the inconvenience. Clerk told me that he would remove the first two nights from our bill. Now at home reconciling my credit card charges and I see that I did NOT receive the comp promised to me. This hotel has fallen way off from what it used to be and I would not recommend Luxor to anyone I know.
30,Room location bad cleanliness subpar parking issues slow service at registration. Put on a floor that was supposed to be closed for maintenance work had to move all our luggage to another area. Very inconvenient and had no help.
50,Loved my stay. This is the second time and I’ll definitely be staying here in the future. The spa services are awesome. See Sharronda H. for your waxing and other skin care services. See Diane for your nails.
10,Interesting from the outside yes. But that’s it. The entire hotel and casino is old outdated filthy and in dire need of update & repair. The worst rooms we have ever stayed in on the strip. Amenities are nowhere to be found. Elevators & escalators not working properly if at all. Staff didn’t clean or restock either of our rooms on Sunday. That hotel hasn’t seen a deep cleaning since the original pyramids were built. We will return to Vegas but never to the Luxor again. It was terrible.
30,Room key did not properly function on the first day. Front desk didn't resolve the problem. Unable to get room service due to restaurant o line set up. Wasn't aware there was no coffee maker or iron..
20,The room could have been cleaner I only spent a few hours in the room since I was there for 1 night for a meeting but while I was there I noticed it was hair on the shower floor and walls and the room smelled like cigarettes
50,overall a great value casino great rooms! clean. black jack games are not good poor rules better off not playing them. parking is expensive. decent area on the strip easy to get in and out of the parking structure
40,The Luxor Hotel and Casino is a great place to stay in Vegas if you are looking for somewhere that’s not going to be too busy. It’s at the south end of the strip away from the most popular places to stay (bellagio and Caesars) so it sees a bit less tourist traffic than others which I enjoy. Table games are always a reasonable price. They also have good restaurants in the hotel.
10,"The MGM app and digital check in DON""T WORK - DON""T use MUST go to the front desk and get a KEY!! Digital Key would not even allow use of the elevator and when i went to my floor with all my bags - ""digital"" key would not open my door - when I called front desk to complain - they ""SHAMED ME"" for NOT going to the desk and getting a plastic KEY - even though the APP is proud of the fact your are supposed to be able to ""SKIP THE FRONT DESK"" total BS - reported maintenance problem in room and they didn't show up till after 1 AM and called us on the phone at that time waking us UP! more BS - also there is exactly ONE elevator location for any floor and the WALK to your room from there can be a MILE -"
40,Easy access to park and get into casino quickly. It’s on the strip with tram access to other casino resorts. Not expensive but the room was very nice and good bed. Plenty of places to choose to eat at from food court. Great stay for the value
10,Spend a little more and save yourself a headache. Rooms were dirty and not vacuumed toilet had pee in it shower door was broken lumpy mattress half the escalators and walkways were out of service. Just overall rundown hotel.
10,I had stopped on a road trip with my brother for a night on the way to see family for Christmas. When we arrived and checked in we noticed the room smelled like cigarettes. We had been driving for 9 hours and just wanted to get some rest so we decided to not go back down and complain and went to bed. We checked out early in the morning and left. The next day I noticed a $250 charge to my card. I called and asked about it and they told me it was a standard hold and that it will be released back. The day after Christmas the charge went through. I called and they informed me that I was being charged a smoking fee. I told them that neither of us smoked and we noticed the smell as soon as we walked in the door. She put me on hold and came back saying that she was going to refund me. I hang up check my bank to see that she instead of refunding me $210 she accidentally charged me an additional $210. Just the worst possible timing for someone to be taking money non stop from me.
20,The whole property was smelling like smoking weed and Cigaret. Even though you walk through the property it was smelling lime rotten things and carpet was nasty. I would not go in luxor again. I ll try another property
40,I would recommend it to my friends and family . Everything was good except the music it was too loud the first day .the casi was really good but in a busy day the waitress take longer to take your order and take your drink .
50,Easy check-in large rooms good meal options are finally back after the pandemic. Still my go--to place to stay after all these years. Prefer the tower rooms over the pyramid rooms. Pre-paid parking got screwed up last time because I checked in on the app. No problems this time because I checked in at the desk.
30,Recently while staying at the Luxor hotel in Las Vegas had a couple of things happen that was not happy about firstly every morning when I walked out of my room which was on the 19th floor in the pyramid I stepped in a huge puddle of water so obviously there was leaking plumbing which they did nothing about Secondly not once but twice housekeeping walked in on me and my wife while one of us was sitting on the bathroom toilet highly embarrassing. Lastly while eating at the Buffay there was a gentleman walking around with a dog sitting on the shoulder around and over the food which I find highly disgusting  and that alone completely ruined my trip.
30,I been there last weekend between. Thursday to Saturday and let me tell you about this experience. I got a pyramid room which was nice besides the fact toilets not functioning properly. But wish that was the main problem on the day of arrival I went at night get me something to eat and a prostitution was the n the hallway asking me if she can join to my room it feels like no security at all near elevators and anyone can get access to guest rooms  I spoke with one of the managers Alfonso from retail who was decent enough offer me my resorts fee back and get me a 25$ voucher for meal  The thing that pissed me off is the reception manager I think her name was Ashley says they don’t have control around elevators then what do I pay resort fee for? Is it so hard put a security around elevators like almost all mgm properties does?  Usually I stay at the aria and went there just because luck if choice  3 starts are only because Alfonso
10,Reserved a tower suite and got a pyramid suite with bugs and leaky toilet. Very disappointed. Staff was great but pyramid suite room was very far from elevator. Leaky toilet made me not not want to user the toilet
10,Got married here 10 yrs ago. This place has taken a dive . It has gone backwards not forwards. Beat western is a much better stay then this place. Split horribly! Bed was really worn out! I do not recommend this place anymore. I was super dissatisfied
30,My main gripe: These hotels being in millions upon millions of dollars in revenue yet can’t be bothered to fix a damn thing. The amount of times we encountered a broken elevator or escalator was insane. Two out of 4 elevators in the elevator area nearest our room were broken all weekend we were there so getting back up to our room at the end of the night was a 20 minute crowded ordeal. Too greedy to pay the overtime for union workers? Never once saw a broken slot machine though lol. Good notes: The room was fine (aside from the 1970’s quality tv programming) and the shower was great.
50,Great value hotel with good service. Though does not have a mini fridge or a bathtub was overall quite satisfied with the experience.    One thing to note is that it would take about 20mins to walk to the Planet Hollywood area!
30,I stayed here with my son for one night because I thought it would be a fun novelty. I just didn’t realize how dated the rooms were (no USB and no smart technology at all) until we checked in. Felt more like a motel and less like the other MGM hotels. Again not the worst experience but I just prefer other locations more. I did find all of the staff experiences of the hotel restaurants casino etc to be really helpful and have no other complaints.
10,You get what you pay for. I should have known better. Staff was nice except one really rude female bartender. Room heat didn’t work and. worst of all ceiling leaked water got all in my bed. Next time I’ll pay the extra and stay at a premium property
20,Mediocre place - you get what you pay for! We only stayed there because of kids dance competitions not staying anymore. One of our colleagues got robbed also. No options for quality coffee- only Starbucks yikes!
50,Business is very good location to stay. No one bother u and u get everything easy and fast . I strongly recommend this hotel for future stays. Food is good  friendly staffs and most important is that u can access to everything very easy
30,Came to town for our son's destination wedding and to look for a new home. We believe it's still one of the best values in town. Room was spacious even though a few updates would be welcome. Staff was helpful and friendly. Housekeeping staff was always on top of any time of day. There's enough variety in the resort's restaurants to fit your budget and your palette and it was within a short trip to everything we needed via the Tram or Lyft. We had a great stay at a reasonable rate for our extended stay.
10,There was a loud fan outside the adjacent room’s door with its electrical cord running across our door. The fan was loud and ran all night. We had to stop over the cord in order to get into our room. We couldn’t believe they would put us in this room!
10,Very slow checkout extremely long walk to room poor facilities maintenance broken shower door insufficient toilet paper & kleenex tissue dirty carpets stains all over being charged resort fee & resort not being available pure ripoff
50,Enjoyed my stay very much. Beautiful hotel amazing pool places to eat good location friendly staff. Good price. Would love to come back if that is something will bring me back in the future. Thank you
20,The ground floor is excellent but everything else is horrible. My room had mold and leaked. The place still have popcorn ceilings. The rooms look just like the pictures just 30 years ago.my lampshade even had stains.
20,This was my first time stayed at Luxor due to the competition was hosted at the hotel. However I will never go back to this hotel again.    First I called them the night before I checked in to the hotel to make sure I got the connecting room for me my partner and my two kids and they confirmed yes but when I arrived at the hotel they were actually adjoint rooms not connecting rooms at all. I called and talked to them in person but none of them were very helpful. So we ended up to stay in two separated rooms with walking back & forth all the time during our stay.    The hotel room looks outdated. The toilet was super hard to flush and the shower door was rusted. Even thought the West Tower we stayed at supposed to be remodeled.    The air in the hotel was really bad and smoky which caused all four of us sore throats and bad allergies.    The restaurants there were very pathetic compared to other hotels.    Overall I was very happy when we finally checked out from Luxor. It’s definitely not a family friendly hotel and I will never stay there ever again.
50,Great price and location and rooms were quiet. Checking was quick and easy and a lady helped right when I got there to get me checked in so I didn’t have to wait in line and was able to do it all from my phone
20,Our shower ceilings were bubbling from water damage and had a lot of black mold. The hotel didn’t seem to care. Contacted via social media and email received aloof generic responses. The front desk didn’t seem to care either
10,Room was late. Terrible for a suite. The whole location is dated. Everything is old and beat. Eating options are kind of weak. I will say that they did adjust some things for the inconveniences but it's a day late and a dollar short because the dollar value doesn't match the impact of the inconveniences.
40,Iconic hotel. Nice people. Fun decor & holiday decorations.  Access to everything & a small casino. I could find my people easy! We will be back again when our next kid turns 21! Love the Blueman group.
30,When we arrived we were told our reserved rooms were not available. The substitute rooms also had issues. Room was not as clean as it should have been. Toilet shower and sink issues. Luckily the staff was understanding and willing to help the best they could.
50,The offer from MGM to stay at the Luxor hotel for 4 days. I was comped the 4 days plus $100 food and $40 free play for the action that I'd given the Excalibur hotel 3 years ago. When I made the reservation the person who took it took their time to help me book the room and then gave me a couple of suggestions for shows. My room is first class looks brand new with a 50 in TV set. The shower and the bathroom was excellent with plenty of towels and a great shower. Haven't tried the buffet but there's plenty of food choices in the casino. I do believe the slots are a lot looser here than the rest of the strip. Checking was fast and friendly no line with plenty of help getting my bearings. If you're on a budget try this place.
30,Stayed at Luxor for a dance competition. Check in was challenging. Even though I had checked in on line several hours before I arrived my room was not ready at 4:15 so I had to check in at the counter. Room did not have coffee maker. Did not like having to go downstairs for coffee each morning. Comfortable beds and room was quiet
30,Had issues with the elevators not functioning and leaving mass amounts of people waiting for 2 elevators. Waited a good 25-30 during peak times to get an elevator with any open space. Online check in did not work at all so we had to wait about 25 in line to get our room. We had early check in and it took a little while to get our room sorted.
30,I booked this hotel for a 16 hour layover! Paid the $20 for the early upgrade and my room was ready at 10:30 AM so that was awesome and very pleased with that! The bellhop who held and brought our luggage to our room was very pleasant and very friendly - tipped him and you’d think he won the lottery! Such a nice guy! My star rating comes from the out dates rooms and the hard as rock beds! Even the TV is old and fuzzy no mini fridge etc. this was perfect for a long layover option so you’re not in the airport all day and don’t have to take your luggage with you but I certainly would not book the room for a longer stay! The decor and theme of the hotel is really neat though and we enjoyed looking at it!
10,If they offer a $50 voucher you make sure you find out exactly where it can be used because apparently it can’t be used everywhere in the hotel. When I checked in at 9pm at night the person working said my room wasn’t ready when I was suppose to check in at 3pm.. Bought a king size room & they gave me 2 queen size bed room. Check out time is at 11am. I asked to check out at 12pm. $10 charge.. Never had that happen before. $20 a day to park for ALL GUEST. That’s insane you charge for parking for your guest. When you want to contact the front desk just expect to be on hold for at least 10 minutes. I could more than once & both times I stayed on the line for 10 plus minutes waiting to talk to someone. Overall I’ve stayed at numerous hotels on the strip & this is the first time I got charged for all this. My first & last time I will be staying here
40,I am not a fan of the mega resorts anymore but the room and the housekeeping staff were quite nice. Not a fan of all the fees… Resort parking etc.… And traffic has gotten horrendous on the strip. I don’t care for how”big” the city has gotten.
50,Everything was convineint to find ice and vending machine were right down the hall. Food court was good. You can find your way to the strip by going through the excalibur. Friendly staff. Overall i would say my family had a great stay.
50,Rooms are clean beds are big great location & everything was perfect as always! Check-in was so easy and the MGM rewards are very useful. Downloading the app is a huge benefit the access to everything is right at your fingertips with no need for face to face interaction with front desk. I love it!! Hands down my fav hotel on the strip.
30,"Stayed there because of the ease of walking to Allegiant Stadium (reason for our trip). But also great location for Cirque shows at Bellagio and MGM Grand. Ari in bar and Yvonne at check in so helpful and friendly. Probably not going to happen anytime soon but the suite tower rooms could use an overhaul. Yes they are spacious and even though people ask ""How much time do you really spend in your room?"" the answer is enough and it should be clean well appointed and comfortable. Bed and pillows a tad lumpy and could use more bathroom towels. Also ALL the furniture in this hotel is low to the ground! Many joke about how it is designed that way to keep people in their seats and that may be true but BAD experience! even in the suite--almost fall into the chair/couch. Not so sweet if injured!!"
50,We got a room early morning saturday to get away from fremont and the homeless overrunning their casino and the streets. Luxor had our room ready by 9am getting us out of a horrible experience. The luxor is a great place to hang out. We did the bodies exhibit which was super cool. Thank you luxor for saving our vegas weekend.
40,Check in was easy upgrades were reasonably priced. Every staff member was nice and welcoming. Tender Steak was great. Carrot Top was surprisingly hilarious. The casino floor was big enough for me the lack of Konami slot machines was my only complaint. Diablo Cantina kind of sucks like I expected the drinks tasted cheap and over sweetened. Public house was solid for food and drinks and their Oreo milkshake was awesome. Sports book was kind of small and old but it works. The elevators suck. The spa was nice my massage was good don’t book too close to closing time or you will feel rushed after instead of being able to chill and use everything in the spa. The location is perfect for going to Raiders games and not too bad even if you wanted to walk to Mandalay MgM or Cosmo. I’d recommend this to anyone optimistic and go with the flow. Quick to judge negative Nancy’s can go ahead and pay more to stay elsewhere and I bet you’ll still have more fun here.
30,I ordered a very expensive meal that I could not finish I brought it to my room and there was no refrigerator nor microwave so I wasted a $168.. There is no Shuttle to or from the airport. No one took the time to explain anything about the MGM rewards.
50,good price best location good service rooms are great and clean beautiful hotel and casino very exotic construction nice and impressive egyptian theme Being able to transport yourself from one casino to another by train is excellent I will definitely come back.
20,Outdated technology. Poor signage. The elevator was a nightmare for so many guests. The code on cell phone didn’t work to operate the elevator. Parking was charged to my room but I didn’t receive a code. I had to pay again to get out of the garage. No maid service unless you stay more than 3 days. Slots very tight. Did not gamble there. Overall unsatisfied. Staff was friendly.
40,Close to airport and very affordable rooms so didn’t need to rent a car while we visited . I would stay again at this hotel and would recommend to a friend . Good water pressure in the shower and for the most part the room didn’t smell like smoke.
50,Great stay always a good time here. The room was cleaned well. The smell of cigarettes wasn’t bad as it is downtown old town. The staff is friendly. Prices are worth the stay. Awesome location to all events.
30,Cleaning staff needs to be more on their job.the rooms are pricey which I don't mine when I get a clean room ..the hallway to our room was never mopped and when calling the front desk there was no answer
20,Older casino. Need to search for outlets in room. 20-30 minute wait for an elevator day and night. 2 out of 4 elevators were out of service the whole time a portion of visit 3 were down.  Small high limit area with with limited offerings.  Smoking was deadly at certain times.  Mohegan Foxwoods and MGM Springfield all went smokeless and they didn’t lose a dime.
20,Overall the property was poorly maintain with visible scuff marks on walls dents on elevators and cleanliness. There was trash on the center of the buildings I can see dust build-up throughout the casino.  The security guard that handled a combative female was professional and thanks for keeping the patrons safe.
20,Having spoken highly of this casino/resort for years this return for a birthday to our first location to stay in LV early in our relationship was met by disappointing process impacts (gave away a suite upon which we had placed deposit months prior) hotel deterioration (peeling wallpaper water dripping from ceiling in 2nd room to which we were moved broken bathroom exhaust fan peeling wallpaper dislodged tiles body hair in soaking tub) surprisingly poor buffet food quality unnecessarily elevator lines. Great exhibits shows friendly housekeeping staff and general staff engagements otherwise.
30,If the elevator wasn't broken it might've been better. There was at least a 45 min delay in getting an empty elevator. 2 of the 16 elevators were broken that I know of. They just happened to be where our room was.
40,Why do you expect more with a $47 room?  I read all the previous reviews from Dec. it is so interesting to read about the complaints. Let’s face it… why do you expect a Wynn or the Bellagio when you paid under $100?  Yes you have to walk (you have to walk a lot everywhere in Vegas) you have to rent a fridge the elevator feels like it may just fall right there (potential lawsuit?)… but you paid $47 on Groupon!  Every hotel in Vegas will have fees from $30-50 and they are upfront about this.  I was able to get two rooms connecting together in Vegas dirt cheap but the rooms are nice and clean. I also got to show my kid a pyramid hotel!The staff is working hard and well. Yes we got to our room and one AC unit was not working… within 30 minutes it was fix by a technician and a fridge was brought to us.  I am a luxury girl but with times like these…. $47 on Groupon! How can I pass that up when I need space and 3 beds? Of course next on our agenda for an anniversary in the far future is the Bellagio or Wynn for $2000-700 a night…  Honestly my foreign relatives were very impressed by the hotel and room.  Elevator…. Oooohhhhh close your eyes and keep going. We are saving money right?!
30,I didn’t know I had to double check if a hotel size of Luxor had room service but they don’t. The shower drain was clogged no mini fridge (at an extra cost and while gambling in the casino all of the bars were closed or didn’t open in time. I would‘t stay here again for free nights.
30,Our friends room got robbed and everything was taken including the underwear and the other friend found a stranger in her room after she got out from a shower. Everything the same day.We used to love the hotel we are not staying there any more.  we are not feeling safe.
10,I couldn’t believe this trip went the way it did it from check in to the room and the internet disconnecting I seen a show and dirt on the ventilation systems to the long walks with the elevators not working just overall a bad existence wouldn’t recommend
50,Everything was nice from the check in to the rooms to the maid service to MGM rewards staff to the casino. Good location and good entertainment. Great value. We saw BlueMan group and were really entertained. Will definitely stay again.
10,Terrible customer service. Paid for a king and got 2 queens. Overpaid by $200 even though it was supposed to be $400 for pickleball players. Front desk was so mean. Charged my partner $648000 for a room. Yes you read that correct. A joke of a hotel.
50,Excellent venue and proximity to stadium is a short walk. Will recommend the Luxor to anyone traveling to Las Vegas for a Raider game or any other event at Allegiant Stadium. MGM app is easy to use and eliminates all waits. Buy the self parking pass for extra ease!
10,Charging cord for Apple Watch went missing from room! Miscommunication with having to checking out and checking in again for second night. Never heard of this! Missed part of football game to run back to hotel!!
10,Upon check in our room was very dark and outdated. It looked NOTHING like the pictures online. Also our bathroom was covered in hair and didn't look clean. We will choose a different hotel in the future.
50,Parking structure to front desk reservations and rooms is very very long. Not recommended for people with asthma bad knees or elderly. Valet and parking is expensive. East tower rooms are the best. Friendly and helpful staff.
30,Stay at Luxor was ok but the post stay credit card charges 111.12 is totally unacceptable. I will be disputing such charges with my credit card company. We paid for an upgrade then wasn't in the room 12 hours before we had a major ceiling water leak in the bathroom and had to move .
20,Decent hotel. Our AC didn't work and we spent so much money ubering down to the fun part of the strip that the cheaper rate the Luxor tends to offer was not really worth it. The hotel desperately needs to be updated and the elevators are seriously sketchy. They wobble and shake and are slanted. Each trip up and down was uncomfortable. Our AC also would not stay on. So woke up multiple times a night with the room at 79 degrees instead of at 68 where we set it. And would have to turn it back on again. Just to wake up in sweat 2 hours later.
40,Other than it’s location at the south end of the strip our stay at the Luxor was perfect for a budget friendly 4 day stay…Staff all friendly hotel clean room clean ( pyramid) slight issue at check in as our room was not ready until around 7 pm… Front desk took meal off our bill which was a surprise and much appreciated… Thank-you Mari…  Quiet hotel at this time of year overall quiet everywhere it was nice…  We liked this property and glad we stayed… it is a bit too south down the strip for our liking but glad to have enjoyed it at least once…
10,Not a premium property. Some outdated technology (e.g. no USB outlets). The room TV seemed quite good but with a terrible signal fom the service provider and a low quality remote. You also pay almost $40 a night resort fee that gives nothing except internet service but that will not let you access many ticket agencies (you get flagged as potential fraud...but the it works fine when you use your phone's own signal). Avoid.
20,Rooms appeared dirty and outdated. A lot of areas in the room that appeared damaged and looked as if everything was fixed with a quick repair rather than addressing the problem or replacing the damaged item. A lot areas were dirty.
30,Rooms weren’t bad- food was over the top. Lots of hidden fees. Bartenders weren’t friendly. Opted out of getting my room cleaned and they did the first day and charged me anyways. It was a neat design and nice it was connected to the surrounding hotels.    Buffet staff was very friendly.
20,The Luxor financially gouges you at every turn...from the $35 daily resort fee to the $18 a day to park regardless of your status as a hotel guest. Why would they charge $18 a day to park in addition to the $35 daily resort fee only to make you walk a long distance from the parking structure to the hotel while exposed to the elements!?    Staff do not appear to be as pleasant as our previous stays over a year ago. Whether it was the registration desk or the cafe everyone was abrupt and even abrasive in some cases.    The only saving grace was the attentive and pleasant service provided by a gentleman named Richard in engineering when we experienced a problem with our air conditioning system.    Room was clean shower head is not very flexible and a bit inconvenient pillows seemed overfilled bed was comfortable good choice in tv programming options West tower elevators are so much more efficient than other elevator system in hotel.
40,Stayed in a king suite on the 4th floor. The room was large with an extra tub (no jets) not far from the king size bed with many pillows. The extra side room with a couch and chair and another TV allowed me to watch the World Cup without waking up my wife. The location was perfect walking distance to Allegiant Stadium where I watched my OSU Beavers win the Las Vegas Bowl.  The room we had looked and smelled fine - the other room my college buddies had down the hall smelled moldy. The price and location were above good. Some staff were better than others but mostly all good. December so no pool usage but looking at the expansive area with several pools from above - you can imagine this would be a good place in sunnier weather.  I will go back here in the future if their rates stay competitive.
10,The room was quite outdated. Limited power options no work environment in the room. There was a dirty rag on the floor when I walked in and the TV console was covered in some sticky goop. The same sticky goo was all around the huge tub in the room which I avoided. Poor water pressure and the TV reception was blurry
30,Stay was good employees were friendly. My only complaint is that they do not have coffee makers in the rooms. That is standard for any hotel. This makes one have to walk downstairs just for coffee in the morning. Vending machine also did not function on my floor
10,Old and just plain gross room! The only thing the shower was missing was uncapped used needles. The cigarette buts outside our room were there the whole time we were. $400+ a night and I felt like I was staying in a $49 room.
10,We booked a corner suite with a big tub for a couples weekend and didn’t even touch the tub. It was dirty and the windows near it were sketchy. The bed was hard and uncomfortable. Sheets are so scratchy and there’s no real comforter. There was food in the fridge when we arrived and we had to request the room be cleaned again. The sink leaked. The walls are so thin! The tint was peeling off the windows. Furniture was wonky and didn’t open right. The tv is old and the sound was off. The elevators looked and felt like they were falling apart. Not a great experience for the price! Worth it to pay a little more for a better hotel.
50,"I have been to VeGaS at least a dozen times and have hopped around different casinos on the strip and on Fremont street. This has been BY FAR the best experience I have had.    I think my boyfriend and I were just really lucky with the staff we had. We arrived to check in and were told that we could upgrade to a suit for only $30 more. We were only there for one night and figured we take up the opportunity. The front desk woman AG gave us a $100 voucher to use at their Catina Mexican restaurant. The voucher was amazing and so thoughtful. It was just my boyfriend and I and the voucher said ""$25 per person"" but the restaurant in Luxor still let us max out the voucher!    THEN the upgraded hotel room (which had a tub in it and a living room) had a small leak of water in the ceiling. They comped our entire stay!    You will not find customer service like Luxor!"
30,Tower rooms NICE pyramid rooms yuck!!! Staff nice good location nice casino! Next time only stay in tower NOT Pyramid or will stay somewhere else. All good service and fantasy show were really good. ;)
10,"The Luxor is absolutely filthy and outdated. The smoke residue and dust bunnies hanging from the cracked ceilings in the hallway and the trash on top of the lower-level buildings if you look over the rail are disgusting. There are NO room amenities unless you pay extra. Not even a frig I mean seriously even the cheapest Motel 6 has a frig. The room was just kind of shabby and unkept. Hand prints and smudges on the bathroom door Sink fixtures had the silver plating peeling off. Cracks in the walls. The ""off season special price"" of $46.00 ended up costing well over $200 once they added $30.00 for parking multiple front desk fees for idk what. I am completely disappointed."
30,The room was uncomfortable due to the fact the AC and vent fans (for tub area and in the bathroom) worked horribly. I will not spend 300$ a night for the King Corner Suite again. Not worth the price. I rather just stay in the tower which has nicer and working rooms.  The employees were very nice and hotel was clean.
40,Walls seem to be a bit thin cuz I could hear the outside traffic and other neighbors in the room next door.  No coffee makers in rooms. When you want to have a tea late night (when you need it you can’t make yourself one and Starbucks is closed.
40,We had a blast in Vegas and we're more than happy with our room. Though hotel staff including drink servers seemed to be lacking greatly. We did not have any issues and enjoy our time immensely. Would def stay there again.
10,Someone has a master key and scans into peoples rooms and will steal half of your stuff so just be prepared. I didn’t realize how common this was for this specific hotel until after it happened to us.
10,The overall smell is terrible. The entry way smells like someone's musky flowering armpit. Found a peanut butter cup by the bed. The layout of the place is ridiculous. Even with the map. Outlets are loose and scary.
50,great stay. absolutely recommend. the hotel was in a great spot and had tons of things to do in the hotel alone. great food options as well. will absolutely be staying again on my next visit to Vegas.
30,Didn't get placed in the room we reserved. Some staff were careless. The Luxor is beautiful to look at but there are so many promotors trying to get you into a timeshare by providing discounted shows.
40,The hotel is a fun place to stay. I enjoyed eating at the Buffet if they have the Verde Posole I would recommend having a bowl or two. We enjoyed the Public House as well. One thing is the hotel is starting to look the 30 years old it is in some areas carpet looks worn the inclinators are a little rough and bumpy. I like the new security system that requires key cards to access floors on the elevator. The rooms had been updated but parts of the bathroom were already worn.
30,I do not recommend staying here unless you’re old and on a budget. It is far away from most events on the strip. The drains have issues. The elevator is at an angle so it feels horrible when you’re drunk. The food is mid. There’s no microwave or refrigerator in the hotel room.
10,Every service in this hotel sucked valet tried to give me wrong car front desk was so rude try to complain as soon as they found that would not answer my phone calls from room never fixed anything. . . ...
10,Besides the rooms which were 1980s condition with tiny tv’s the casino sucked. Barely any tables open with auto shufflers except for 2 tables with a minimum bet of $500. Food was terrible and it cost me $25 for a Jonny Rockets double cheese burger
30,I've stayed at Luxor in the past. The most memorable visit was back in 1997 and that was a far better experience than this time. I missed the 'inclinators' which seem to have been replaced with regular elevators and as I already mentioned the lack of a mini bar fridge in the room was disappointing.
10,Charged me an additional fee since I booked through Groupon. Did not disclose this at check in and when I finally found a number to call where I could get some customer service they refused to credit me back in full. Said it was Groupon's responsibility to notify me...If Luxor is charging me it's their staffs responsibility to notify me.
40,Room very dusty after wiping the room down our overall stay was amazing with family and friends thank you to the Luxor staff the wedding guests had a blast see you all next year Happy Holidays from ou family to yours
20,I didn't appreciate waking up & having to go 4 floors down on a walk across the huge casino locate a coffee shop & spend a bunch more money just to get my morning coffee! I was shocked the rooms didn't offer complimentary coffee!!!
30,We were there for our 9th Anniversary. End up my husband lost his phone on one of the machine. Becase he walked to the cash machine just for 1 min and forgot to take the phone with him. When he returned it was gone. We asked for help but no one care. The security said nothing they could do about it. We filed the report but didn't help us anything. Also The odd of machine also very low. Put 100 in just to get just 10 dollars back in the bonus spins. I have tried many of them and they are the samevery tight. Food was very expensive around here. The buffet was not much in it for the price. We paid $62 for two but only eggssalad and potato with a litle bit of fruits on the bar so it wasn't worth it. We woke up early every morning during our stayed because always some worker working on something like drilling at 7:15 am. Or cutting wood sounds in the morning was so disturb.
30,Just average bill was too much slot machines don’t pay. I spent $2000 and only won $500  Staff asking for tips “ we work based on tips”  Parking is expensive  Room wasn’t great felt old style  Check in app was the only thing that I liked
10,Room: no coffee pot no microwave no mini-fridge no clock no fitted sheets on bed ugly outdated wallpaper and window coverings. Long check-in lines. Hard to find anyone for any type of service. Very disappointing Find another place to stay. The nicest people were the housekeeping staff and they do a good job providing clean rooms That's it though.
50,The Luxor offers the basic minimum for a classic Casino/Strip experience in Vegas at a great affordable price at least compared to other hotels on the strip. The entertainment options were great and the rooms were excellent.
50,Still one of the best properties in Vegas! From the staff hotel cleanliness food and bar selection...You name it! AND THE ROOMS ARE NOT TOO EXPENSIVE! Give Luxor a try you'll love it and you'll definitely come back. Trust me!!!
10,Valet experience was horrible. Machine always wanted to double charge. Room was filthy esp after we used our own clorax wipes. Tv never worked. Feont desk never cared at all. Check in was long but lady was nice
30,We appreciate the comps but just didn't feel a s special as we normally do when coming to the Luxor. The room was OK but very old and rundown. the slots seemed very tight. We really enjoyed the pyramid cafe and staff. the staff in the vip room were nice and got a dresser sent to our room as there was no place to store our clothes? We had to call everyday to get real coffee pods delivered. We never heard from our casino host while there so she must have been very busy.We will look into staying at a different property next time.
50,I had a long layover and this hotel had a great price short distance and Exelent service n bed was so comfy I sleep for 7 hrs n was back at the airport will come back soon for a longer stay. Defenelly recomendem
40,So needed time off from family work and stress. Luxor was a nice less expensive option and the hotel rooms were worth it. I wish its location would be closer to the main entertainment on the strip. And the hotel bars would close later than 12:30 am.
10,I would have given this property a negative 100 if possible. There is no way possible I should be out of town afraid to sleep because of roaches. All 3 rooms were very dirty. Carpet was dirty and worn stains in the tub hair in the walls of the shower… just nasty!
30,The room had no coffee maker fridge microwave. Not usual for a 4 star hotel/casino. Didn't honor comped room. In need of upgrade. Casino was ok security seemed ok but when someone passed out blackjack table it took a while for the medical personnel to respond
40,This hotel is underrated and if you are looking for a comfortable and spacious room that’s reasonably priced stay here. Tram service to Excalibur makes access to the south end of the strip easy. Food options are limited and some of the escalators were out of service during our stay but overall I was impressed with our accommodations.
40,Vegas trip was great. I had an exceptional experience. Staff was friendly and rooms were nice. The elevators were a little run down but other than t that it was a good experience. With it being apart of mgm you can park anywhere
50,We arrived with extreme motions sickness from all the traveling. On top of all the mayhem (being sick/keeping track of luggage) when checking in we misplaced a piece of luggage and our room key. Francis #372608 found us in distress found our luggage at security talked to the front desk manager to find us a first floor room (we were originally on the 13th floor but any motion such as the elevator was not going to end well for us or the elevator). Sam at check-in found us a room on the first floor and continued to calm us tell us everything would work out and basically they saved our vacation. Because of both Francis and Sam on 12/9/22 we'll be staying at the Luxor EVERY time we come to Vegas. Thank you Francis and Sam!!
50,The Luxor is still and will always be that Oasis in the middle of the desert for us. Great people providing great service has always what we appreciate the most when staying here. In a time in where value for you dollar is important the Luxor checks off every box and is a place I always recomend for folks wanting to visit Vegas.
50,Great place to stay and affordable. Definitely will be back. Place was clean and staff was friendly. The check in process was effortless. The tv program could be updated with more channels since it currently has very basic channels.
10,One of the bartenders was extremely rude. Asked me for an ID for a cup of water then denied me a cup of water since “I have to buy something”. It’s a small thing but who denies someone a cup of water. I wasn’t rude or anything think the guy got mad because I drank 3 cups of water in 2 hours. That shouldn’t matter though. Didn’t know the Luxor was run by Nestle.
50,We always wanted to stay here and made the decision too and we did not regret it very clean hotel friendly staff we had a seamless check-in they set us up with our MGM rewards card hotel is right on the strip at the South end we enjoyed the easy access to Mandalay and Excalibur hotel right from the Luxor great stay!
40,The bars and atmospheres were great check-in is a mess and getting ahold of the front desk was terrible. Sat on hold with the front desk for over 20 minutes to get our rooms situated. The hotel is great and bar staff was fun to talk with during our 4 night stay.
30,Dated hotel trying to be a resort but many things need to be fixed escalators elevators no fridge in the room bathroom exhaust fan not working window seals broken dripping condensation. The breakfast buffet was not open and they only have an outside pool so it was closed.
10,Horrible and not. Worth me coming back ever again even if the rooms free. I would much rather pay 250 a night than to stay at a location this bad in my future trips to vegas. I will keep this in mind which will motivate me to never step foot in the Luxor again
50,The suite was HUGE and super clean. The hotel staff is nothing short of AMAZING! Miriam Gomez took care of us and our room during our stay and she always always always went above and beyond to make sure we were comfortable and had everything we needed! She also had a very addicting bubbly personality and was a true joy to be around. The shows and exhibits that the hotel offered were amazing as well. They also make it very easy to secure tickets to shows offered at other hotels as well. It was an all around extremely pleasant experience! Thank you!
40,The staff was awesome! Everyone was very helpful and lovely. Love the breakfast at pyramid cafe. We were in town for basketball at michelob arena. Very short walk and didn’t have to go outdoors. Only issue was with the elevators but it’s because they have upped the security measures.
30,It was ok but it’s very dated and we found the person on the front desk not very helpful!    We weren’t aware of any of the facilities of the hotel which he could have up sold to us.    The room was clean but some things needed attention the bathroom sink was blocked and slow to drain the double electrical socket kept falling out of the wall (possible electrocution risk!) noisy air conditioning/heating.    We will be back to Vegas but not to the Luxor but a better hotel…
50,I enjoyed Luxor. The housekeeper came back later to clean room. Hotel in between two others so I didn't have to go out in the cold to play. The restaurant was good and the tables was cheap. Will visit again in spring.
30,The hotel itself is decent. The room was clean and beds comfortable. I removed stars for how thin the walls are so you can hear everything from the rooms around. The wifi kept disconnecting too. If you’re looking for something decent at a good price it’s a good one though.
50,The person on the phone and when I got to the rewards desk need to get on the same page. Besides paying for things I shouldn’t have had to because I should have gotten a different rewards package it was an OK stay
10,Staying at a Luxor pyramid-suite was once a go-to regarding Las Vegas but my room stunk to High-Heaven and management seemed to not care... my only response is to not give a damn myself and stay somewhere else on my next visit.
50,The room was very nice I wish there had been a mini fridge and microwave however the tv was great and we brought a fire stick which was able to connect to the free wifi. The staff was super sweet and there was a lot to do. Our room smelled smoke free though we did hear our neighbors late at night they weren't even yelling but the walls are not the thickest
30,Long check in and check out. Prices have become outrageous. If you’re considering a family trip be prepared to pay for everything a-la-cart—-especially coffee and water. The food is good. The beds are comfortable.
30,It was ok. If you are going to a conference at the convention center this is not a good location for you. It is a mile+ to the monorail station at MGM grand. It is a nice spot if this is the area that you will be in (MGM NYNY Mandalay etc). I liked the room it was the basic one but the elevators were slow and there was not a lot of them. Long waits at the elevator. The housekeeping service was fantastic. The staff was nice and the restaurants were fine. That said it is an older hotel and it was just ok..
50,Visited Las Vegas for a College basket tournament at Mandalay Bay Michelin Arena. Stayed at Luxor. Great properties and did not have to go outside or take transportation to get to arena. Fun restaurants and sports bars along the way. Would stay here again.
50,I chose the Luxor after trying to stay at the NYNY. NYNY was very expensive. The Luxor was almost half the price. I expected the quality to be about half but I was wrong. Great quality and great experience.
30,There is no refrigerator in room location is good. Casino no good pay off. No drinking water in room. Expensive super market just 1liter water $5:35 I was not happy at all hotel rate cheaper in weekdays
20,We stayed 4 nights and every day there was trash and bags of used linens/towels in the hallways. There was also what looked like part of a rat trap. The a/c in our room set itself to 79 while we were attending a show. Front desk said it did that because of the outside temperature. We set it back to 69 so we could sleep but after a while it reset itself to 79! We set it to 69 again and this time it stayed the rest of the night. At checkout we tried to use their mobile app but it failed every time we tried it.
50,Though there wasa minor issue with the room that my husband and I stayed but the staff made sure to address the issue. I will come back to stay here again. Staff are very accommodating and approachable
30,I paid for the early check-in option online (11AM) for the hotel as I was flying in from Hawaii on the red-eye and would have liked to simply jump into the shower and plop on my bed and get some sleep. Even though my payment went through the system did not process it or something like that so I stood in the front desk line which was about 50 people deep. Fortunately a lady probably one of the managers saw me and asked if I needed any help. I explained the situation to her and she pulled me out of the line and promptly offered me a room that was ready. By time I got to the room it was nearly 1PM. I was too tired to think of asking for anything at the time and I was not offered anything in compensation for having the problem. The hotel itself was ok. Needed to get used to the elevators as the do not travel straight up and down so the rattle quite a bit. The carpeting shows the hotel has not been through any recent renovations.
40,We love staying at the Luxor it is a great value with an excellent location. Our only disappointment is they have taken the refrigerators out of the rooms making it more difficult to keep leftovers and drinks cold. We like the smaller casinos and the Luxor is great for a less overwhelming stay!
10,The Luxor has great events and exhibits but the quality of the rooms worse than a motel 6. The next time we come to Vegas and we do come often we will not stay there again. The rooms and hallway hallways are dirty and terribly run down. The property needs to be either remodeled or torn down
40,A bit pricier than 5 years ago overall but I’ll be back and the Luxor is a solid place to stay. Hot water is not in short supply. Really nothing that was lacking. Super Happy Overall had a fantastic comfortable time at the Luxor!
50,Family time weekend! Clean rooms. Excellent food. Lost money but had a great time doing it! Staff very accommodating. Always willing to help in any way they can. My family’s go to hotel when visiting Vegas.
40,Was able to get a last min room after we decided to stay one more night at the NFR. Every thing was amazing and the front desk was able to get a room for us on the same floor as our friends staying there. My only complaint is I could not get a hold of anyone in room service for a coffee delivery and they do not have coffee pots in the room. I sat on the phone for 45 min being transferred and sitting on hold before the call got disconnected. The husband finally went to the coffee shop to get it for me. Who stays up all night having fun and doesn't want coffee first before peopling?
50,I always love staying here. Reasonably prices clean rooms and nice staff. Would love to stay in an upgraded room when I come back. Looking to bring my kids here in June I would love to get good comp rooms
50,For the money the place is safe and clean & quiet once you’re inside your room. Easy access doors to Uber area. Quick ride to the airport. I love that you can skip the check in (long) lines are use the MGM digital app to check in and walk straight to your room when you arrive.
40,Eat at Tender - great service and food. Visit Ari at the Aurora bar - great customer service. Location is great. Value is great. Rooms are very nice but have no coffee makers or fridge and room service was mostly “unavailable” when we tried to order.
20,Staff did care about any issues. The few that did could not help cause they needed to talk to a supervisor. Weed smoke broken elevators and no hotel security when called. Even asking for a new remote was not granted
50,Hannah at check-in is efficient and kind. This property is older but still in good shape. Connected to Mandalay Bay & Excalibur & MGM & New York New York properties are easy walks so in heart of great entertainment restaurant & bar area.
30,I stayed at Luxor with my friends for a conference. The staff at the hotel was nice as well as the cleaning service. If you are into casinos and shows it is a very walkable area. The only downside was that there was indoor smoking allowed which made the lobby level of the hotel smell terrible and was also suffocating. In addition it was always extremely cold in the hotel and the lights seemed like they were half on which gave me a headache every day.
10,The Luxor was my go to place. This last trip was a massive disappointment. Avoid the buffet! Nasty and expensive. Worse thing… no bacon at brunch. Very few table games open. Either no more lace to sit or wait for hours before someone gets up.
20,I had a high anticipation of the Luxor heading in for my first trip to Vegas. Granted the resort is 25 years old BUT the neglect was apparent. If you’re choosing to stay in the pyramid expect poor lighting when getting ready and also the linens and pillows are all worn out. The minimum bet for poker tables was $20 which seemed a little high for the level of casino it is. But the service is pretty good and app is helpful. I recommend the MGM Grand or The Mirage over the Luxor
20,"...and now it's not. CarrotTop is the headliner - which should tell you all you need to know. It's like meeting the hot girl from high school who is now a hooker with a booze issue.    I stayed here twice in two weeks. Once by choice (for a game) and once because I was way too late on making a reservation at Mandalay.    If you're paying more than $49/night you're paying WAY too much. I also made the mistake of getting a cabana at the pool. The couch looked like a baby may have been born on it.    This hotel NEEDS renovation. No USB ports in the room.    One good thing - the table stakes are generally low. Although when it sells out (usually because Mandalay is full when there's a conference) they raise the stakes...which is just ridiculous.    If you told me that I would never be able to stay at the Luxor again I would say ""thank you thank you thank you!!"""
10,Terrible dirty hotel. Staff will not help you at all. The check in process was a hassle. The carpets all around the hotels are dirty. The food was overpriced for the quality. Overall not at all satisfied with my stay
40,Stayed at the Luxor during the National Finals Rodeo. The hotel and casino were great energy and a great time. Lots of folks but the hotel handled everything perfectly in checking in and checking out. This was a really good Vegas experience. I will stay there again!
30,Lot’s of rude casino servers and dealer’s. Room’s didn’t feel very nice for a place that bills itself as a fancy Las Vegas hotel. Also you have to rent a fridge for $25 a night.    Although pricey in general not as expensive as I thought. Excellent food at the pyramid cafe and the backstage deli. Pyramid cafe is extremely understaffed on the weekends. Cool shopping malls on the way to Mandalay Bay and Excalibur. Overall I’m going back next year.
30,First time staying here; however have gambled prior. Booked four nights comp with no RF plus FP & RC. Booked a tower one bedroom suite. Got put in a corner pyramid suite; from what I can tell about 100 sq ft difference. Room 5121 to be exact. It’s not cramped but bad use of space. The fact that it’s in the pyramid makes the room set up weird. Soaker tubno jets. Nice size mini fridge. No coffee maker. Bed was not comfortable- I’m thinking older mattress. Bathroom has a standard shower one vanity. Chaise sofa & TV in the sitting area. Desk with lamp.    The room was clean. The casino is clean. Most staff are friendly. Food court on upper level. Starbucks x3. Easy access to Excalibur and Mandalay Bay via indoor walk ways. Tram access which I have never used. Drink service for the most part was good.    Now on to petty commentary.    Elevator bank for my room was 4A. Down a hall around a corner. In a corner. No foot traffic near by. A lot could go wrong. Not a fan. Most elevators are in public places.    Cell service was abysmal. I usually never use Wi-Fi; had to here. Didn’t matter if I was in my room or on the casino floor. I honestly can’t remember the last time I had to use hotel Wi-Fi. This was the only casino I had the issue.    Poor lighting in hotel room. Difficult for makeup application. Poor lighting in sitting area. Reading would be difficult.    The soaker tub is in the corner with the slanted wall. A 5yo could easily get in the tub. Full size adult? Don’t hurt yourself.    The hallway of my floor and I would guess the entire pyramid need some love. Definitely time for a refurb. Run down? No. Falling apart? No. Just need some fresh paint and new carpet.    No deadbolt on door or separate door jamb or separate lock. To lock the door the handle needs to be turned up. Not a fan.    On the brighter side    Three Starbucks. MGM has 100% mobile check in with digital key. The backstage deli is a hidden gem. Food is actually very good and fresh. During pool season the Luxor has Temptation Sundays- LGBTQ 🏳️‍🌈 friendly.    In the end this is a clean value property. Would I stay here again? Yes. Would it be my first choice? No. I would recommend if budget conscious. If you do not have a car but have mobility issues it may not be a good choice. The resort is large and very south strip. If you don’t mind walking and like to get your steps in this would be a good place.
20,Room was not up to par for the $787 I was charged. Showers that don't have a door caused a slip hazard for me cause water got out to the tile. Beds were not that comfortable. Not worth the almost $800
10,After checking our bags at the bell service because our check in wasn’t ready (even though I paid for early check in) the baggage ticket we had was stolen by the time we noticed it was gone the thief had gone to the bell service and claimed our luggage without any form of identification causing us to lose everything we brought. The hotel did next to nothing to make up for it considering the severity.
20,Checked in to my room only to discover that it had not been vacuumed when housekeeping turned the room over from the last guest. There were several toenail clippings on the carpet. I tried to call Housekeeping only to discover that the phone in the room was inoperable. On the second day of the stay the housekeeper changed out the towels but did not make the bed. When I went to use the towels a long black hair was on the towel; I do not have long black hair.
10,Our hallway on the 6th floor had a large two wall water leak outside our room. The drywall was exposed down to the pipes with what looked like mold. You could tell by the extent of the damage this had been there for a while. We walked thru wet carpet to get to our room. Luxor has differed maintained it’s like a cheap off strip hotel.
50,This is a great Hotel and Casino......DEFINITELY WILL RECOMMEND!!  You will like th?e fact that you read this review. and took my advice From Pricing Service and location.....You cannot ask for a better Hotel and Casino. ......THE LUXOR ROCKS!!!!😊😊
40,I've stayed multiple times with no issues except the last one. There was an issue with the air conditioner that no one came to fix after multiple calls. Everything else was good and satisfactory. I will stay here again in the future
10,The room was very dirty. If you looked at the carpet it had not been vacumed at the edges...you could see piles of dust and dirt. Water pressure on the upper floors was low. TV channels did not work
10,Uncomfortable beds toilet seats that wouldn’t stay up no coffee machine in the room the TV didn’t work and no refrigerator in the room. A refrigerator could be provided for $35 a day. Someone please tell me what I’m paying for…. Oh and this was an upgraded room. SMH!
30,Dated rooms and facilities. Elevators clunky and light didn’t work. Resort credit through MGM awards not issued. ATMs often broken. Good food in the Pyramid Cafe with excellent wait staff. Drinks were cold.
20,Rooms decor sound control temp control were outdated as well as keys failed multiple times. The one issue that had to be addressed was resolved quickly and nicely by staff. Overall not the nicest stay. Clearly better options for location and quality of hotel. If you don’t spend time in room or care about fun/vibes of the casino floor or location of the rest of the strip then not a bad place. 25-45 dollar Uber rides to get to anything else can be a problem for some.
50,very clean and fast service. They were able to accommodate us when we booked on such short notice. Housekeeping was also very friendly and quick to service you. The casino was very clean and constantly being disinfected.
30,Rooms were clean but one major thing that was upsetting to us was there was no fridge or bottled water. You have to walk to the vending and pay $3 for one bottle. I think that it should be a minimum of 2 bottles a day. People need water and you should not have to pay for it. Next thing the house keeping cut us off multiple times walkin in the hall way and glared at us. They were also having very loud conversations in the hall way. I think that they should be more respectful of the people paying for the rooms. Sleep was hard you can hear everything in the rooms around you. Sheets were scratchy. Luxor was also very expensive food water not very many budget friendly places to eat. When they take all your money in slots they should at least have cheaper food. Also do not buy beers at the bar.... 2 beers (small) were $20.. We will not stay there again you can have a way better experience off the strip.
30,First time staying at the Luxor I would rate it average . I will probably not stay here again the breakfast Buffet was total GARBAGE  old slices of pizza country gravy was very runny only breakfast meat was sausage links. I m pretty sure the sausage links weren't even 100 meat they were dry and over cooked' We did eat breakfast the next morning at the Cafe were your breakfast was made to order....that was a good breakfast.
40,Luxor gets bad reviews that are unnecessary in my opinion. We had an Elite Tower King Room. Room number 6312. Very clean room. Bathroom was spotless. Shower was excellent. The view was of the airport Tropicana MGM Grand and Excalibur. We’ve stayed in the tower rooms five years ago in 2017. They are as nice now as they were when they were first renovated.
10,Hotel was in an inconvenient location. Amenities in room were worn down or didn’t work. AC units would randomly turn off and make the room stuffy. Staff unpleasant to deal with. Hotel was difficult to navigate through. Good and drinks are overpriced and not good. Too few card playing tables
10,Our trip started by going to self parking and seeing a daily fee. I had requested to be close to self parking but was put on the entire other side. Got my key on my phone to avoid waiting in line for check in but it didn’t work. After carrying all of our luggage across the entire casino. Then had to wait in line to get a key. Asked about the self parking and was not told to put it on the key. Got to the room that had a pounding sound in the bathroom. Called the front desk and it took them 45 minutes to get there. This is now 2;30 am 5:30 am to our bodies. Found no refrigerator microwave or coffee maker. Wasted a gallon of milk. Had to spend $15 a day at Starbucks…… which on the third day was so understaffed that I waited an hour for my mobile order which was not even what I wanted because they were out of everything!!! Then I see I’m paying $39 per day resort fee….. for what??? We never had our room cleaned the entire time we were there. Had to call for toilet paper by Tuesday.
40,I was impressed by the discount I received from MGM rewards and enjoyed my brunch at the buffet .The casino has great deals of new machine and entertainment was spectacular. Surely recommend this place to friends family
50,The room was much bigger than expected! It was clean and had everything we needed. Except a refridgerator but that wasn’t an issue for us. It’s close to everything downtown! We would definitely stay here again.
10,Room was clean but very spartan. No coffee maker no microwave no frig. Very long winding hallways to get to the rooms. No easy check-in. Overall not a user-friendly place to stay. Would not recommend it unless you have no need for the things listed above and are planning to remain in the hotel for the entire visit.
20,We always stay at Bellagio or NYNY but wanted to try something different we upgraded to the premium tub suite and had issues with the room couldn’t use the tub as the water was warm not hot same as shower the living room was less than to be desired broken down couch and just a bunch of random tables in there no TV and was very odd. The staff was great food was good but really disappointed in the room.
30,Watch your belongings. Homeless through out hotel and garage.  Hotel it self is beautiful. no amenities in room. No coffee maker fridge etc. Also half the resturaunts hold horrible hours. Making it hard to eat. Or expensive to say the least.
40,We had almost $200 extra pulled out upon mobile check in. Front desk agreed it was hidden in all areas of booking emails and apps that I could have seen to know they were going to do so. It would just be helpful to have that very clear upon booking. Front desk was amazing and gave me a good credit. Otherwise the stay was amazing.
50,Hotel was ok luv the architecture design. My only problems was clog drain to sinks and shower. Check into room no towels so I had to call room service. Could at least put a bottle of water in mini fridge.
50,I enjoyed all my stays at the Luxor hotel. The room are clean and fresh staff is friendly and knowledge and the prices are great. The check in is always hassle free and quick a long with checking out.
20,I don't think that living people were ever meant to sleep inside of a pyramid. It's loud which is my biggest complaint about my stay. It's not loud from people it's loud from the design. It sounded like the elevator was in my room.
30,Room looked great staff was friendly. Air conditioner didn't work. First maintenance man was supposed to have fixed it and didn't do it properly. 2nd did the 2nd night at 330 am breeding to wake up at 515
30,It was an amazing hotel and so cool to look at but you could tell that it need some up dating and a few things fixed. But it was a great time would definitely go back. Very easy to get around and find stuff to do.
10,This hotel is outdated. I spent over $1k for two nights. My room was old the shower flooded and the hot water was hot one second and cold the next every time I showered the TV was very old and poor quality and there was a hole in the roof over my bed. I regret staying at this hotel and wish I had booked at the newer end of the strip so I at least got quality for this price.
50,I had a great time at the Luxor hotel  the food was nice and the entertainment was great. The staff were very courteous and professional and I had an overall wonderful time you just have to check out the spa relaxing.
10,Our rooms were filthy (night stand had caked on grime and dirt\hair) and the bathroom was also dirty as were the carpets. Our T.V. was broken as well. Staff was unresponsive and rude. We would not recommend staying at LUXOR. We couldn't believe that this was the same company (MGM) that manages another hotel in the ARIA which is arguably one of the BEST hotels we have ever stayed in.
30,Great location and very nice housekeepers. The only bad thing is that there was no fridge which was SUPER inconvenient. Also room smelled musty but besides that everything was okay. Easy checkout and check in
50,Check in was smooth and front desk helpful when our rooms weren’t quite ready. They gave us some free vouchers for food and took our bags while we waited. The beds were so comfortable and the shower’s water pressure divine. My only complaint is I was there for work and fun was limited.
30,Booked our trip and paid for all but $119 that we were told we owed when we arrived at the Luxor. When we arrived we were told we owed $330 and it could be only paid by card and $150 will be credited back at checkout. Then 1st night there room was crawling with Roaches and bugs. They sent up maintenance who seen it too. No apologies just switched to another room. No more Luxor
30,No refrigerator or coffee maker in room. Required extra fee to have refrigerator in place it was obviously previously installed. A Vegas Strip property should not lack amenities that an average Motel 6 provides.
30,The heat wasn’t working in my room that I paid a upgrade for so got switched to a better room which I did love the look but the carpet was wet the heat didn’t work and I slipped and fell in the slippery shower twice.
30,Luxor is ok. Needs a remodel. Room was functional. Bathroom shower leaked onto floor pretty badly. Little things like a very slow drain in the bathroom sink were annoying. The staff was great and the casino was lively and fun. The Centra bar is a good place to congregate.
30,"Digital keys are a great idea unless you are a first time customer and don't know the only elevator to floor 8 (floor 6-15 actually) is behind the front desk. Also not nearly enough outlets to charge 2 phones.why don't you have charging ports on the lamps? Also my husband ""shared"" the room key with me as his took 3 tries to work and my never would link up. Stand in a line zigzagged thrice- I need a drink while I wait for that or you need to get better. Sheets a bit scratchy."
40,The elevators weren’t working very well. Every time we wanted to go back up to our room there was a line to get back up there. Also the TV would turn on really loud. I’m still giving 4 stars because the location in regards to the stadium is great.
50,Great area with big rooms. Food was amazing for a buffet. My kids enjoyed the room size and the comfy beds. Shower was amazing big and spacious. Room service was amazing. If I need extra blankets towels etc. they would show up fast. Valet and fast and very friendly
10,We checked into our room the shower backed up they were supposed to have us move to a room immediately it took over 40 minutes the guy that brought us our keys that he was just handed the key after we called three times they moved us to a room that the sink backed up in the night time bartender was rude as hell as well as their valet guys asking for extra money that's kind of unprofessional
40,Stayed in the pyramid corner Suite which was roomy and quite comfortable. I was on the 22nd floor and my room was as far as possible from the ONE inclinator that accesses that level. Having only one way up to my room became a bit tiresome as the inclinator in slow and usually quite busy. It 5hink next time I will opt for the towers instead of inside the pyramid.
10,They over charged me said I booked with Expedia even though I showed them paperwork I didn’t. Then they refused to care after seeing the proof. On top of that they were so mad they were wrong they deleted my $225 food credit. I even had my platinum business Amex travel reach out to them to show them it was booked with them not Expedia and they still refused to honor anything. After 20 stays with Luxor I think I might be looking for a new Vegas home. We will see if it was just a bad front desk or if corporate will make it right. On top of that the room was disgusting the sink was clogged right when we got in the room and smelled took them 30 hours to fix it and there was a dog barking 24/7 for the whole trip. I recorded it all to send in to corporate.
20,"We visit Las Vegas 2-3 times per year. I have been staying consistently at the Luxor for over 15 years. We used to enjoy the casino and general location and the comps. We had a casino host and always received VIP treatment.    The latest trip this October was possibly the worst experience I have ever had at a major hotel casino. We were relegated to the pyramid. The inclinators were in disrepair. There were wires exposed and the Wi-Fi was not available inside and we had to find a technician to help us get to our floor.    After the first night we went out for the day. Upon returning in the afternoon our room still had not been cleaned. I called housekeeping and asked if we could have our room serviced. The answer was a straight-up ""NO we are understaffed"". The next morning we found a housekeeper and got fresh towels. When we asked her about service she said probably not. They had to prepare empty rooms for arriving guests as a priority.    The bell service up to the room was decent but upon checkout I was told to wait 40-45 minutes. After 50 minutes I called and the person at the bell desk said ""we told you 60-90 minutes you will just have to wait"". As I slammed down the phone I said ""No we don't"". Because the rooms don't have a refrigerator with the cooler we had about 6 pieces of luggage we carried down to self-parking.    At our level of play the self-parking is supposed to be free. After trying both our player's cards and with the line of cars honking behind us I paid $36 to get out of the lot. The invoice I received for the two nights stay was overcharged by $108. Not only had they pre-billed the parking (now $66 total) but failed to give me resort credit. When I called the billing department at 8:30 AM the next day I was simply told that department is closed and they hung up. I disputed the charges with American Express and got most of it taken off of my bill but only after the hassle of sending all the paperwork to prove I was overcharged.    MGM subscribers try the Mandalay Bay Hotel. Much better service casino and food."
30,Spent one night here recently. We arrived to check in around 7.30pm - there was a queue but we probably waited about 15-20 minutes. The lady who helped us was very welcoming and friendly which was appreciated after our long journey from the UK.    We had booked a pyramid room and asked for a high floor if possible. We were on floor 28 and had a good view towards the Strip. Room was large as was the bathroom. Clean too. It seems that some renovations are being done but it's a bit messy. We had new carpet in the room and it looked like newish wallpaper yet the bed and tables were old and scuffed. In the bathroom the sink area looked new but the shower not. If you're going to renew the rooms then do everything at once not just bits here and there!    The worst part was the corridors - old carpet and doors. Not the best impression.    On check out the next morning a different lady helped us - again she was smiling and chatting. The Luxor reception staff were the most friendly we encountered on our trip to Vegas.
30,Did not realize that a coffee machine and refrigerator were considered luxury but they were not present in the room. When speaking to concierge downstairs about requesting items such as toothepaste they directed me to go to the room and call room service. But there were no instructions on what number to call and the phone didn't have any indications so we accidentally called the emergency number before getting the right person. Check-in was supposed to be around 3 pm with the possibility of earlier; understood this and was able to store luggage away until then but didn't get a room until closer to 5 pm and we had been there since 7 am that same day.
30,Location was ideal for Allegiant Stadium enjoyed the walk from hotel to stadium (maybe 15mins) and that's taking in the scene of surroundings and fans for game day and pick up at hotel for Grand Canyon tour was a big plus
40,Staff was very friendly and casino overall was clean. The rooms were a little worn down and needed some paint but overall it was a nice stay. I would recommend the Luxor to friends and family who are on a budget.
10,We were called at midnight by the manager via telephone in the hotel room to move rooms due to a contracted pretreatment they had to complete in our previous room. We had to move all our belongings to a new room the next morning which was completely ridiculous. If they had a contracted pretreatment they should not have given us that particular room in the first place! In addition calling us in the middle of the night was extremely inappropriate. I hated the stay due to this reason
30,I have two problems here  1. $91.39 (reservation total) + $18.00 (parking) + $32.64 (drinks) = $142.02. In a hurry I did an express check out no receipt I was charged for $159.38.  2. I paid $18 for parking never received the parking ticket back. I had a hard time to leave the parking lot.
50,Great customer service. The employees are very happy and have a smile on their faces. Sad to say you don’t really see happy employees anymore. But there you do! Having our room upgraded really made our night unforgettable. Thanks for everything! Luxor definitely has my business! Keep up the great work.
30,Stayed at the Luxor for a recent conference. Rooms were average nothing to write home about. Overall service and hotel location were spot on people were nice and the conference was close to the conference location.
30,Had bugs in my shower. Housekeeping skipped a day of cleaning my room. Bed was almost to the floor and uncomfortable and rooms still need more upgrade bathtub looked 30 years old and dirty rest of Hotel was nice ordered room service one morning took an hour to get my breakfast I had to call to get it.
30,Facility was clean and convenient. However there was no laundromat. While I realize there is a send-out service laundry is obviously not able to be done on demand. This is a high end hotel and there is no conceivable reason why it would lack a basic amenity like a laundromat.
20,Stayed here for the first time for our anniversary. At check in was offered an “upgrade” for a little more money. We excitedly paid thinking we’d splurge for our special occasion. WRONG. The “corner pyramid suite” was very old and dated. The carpet smelled of smoke. The AC rattled all night. The furniture was sparse and scattered throughout the room randomly. A small minibar fridge stood on its own looking out of place. There was lots of empty space like the furniture was taken away and someone forgot to re-decorate. It felt like a sleazy motel room.
50,First time staying at Luxor and it exceeded my expectations. Room was cleaned daily and did not have any complaints. Decent price and easy access to shoppes restaurants and nearby hotels. Will definitely be back soon.
10,Overall disappointed in the amenities provided and the need to spend ridiculous amounts of money to have the basic necessities. I could have gotten the same level of quality staying at a motel 8 but would have been half the price or less.    Pros: close proximity to the strip and able to walk wherever (but not a unique aspect to the Luxor and can be found elsewhere). Housekeeping was very attentive and I appreciated their care.
30,I wish I had stayed at the Venetian or Excalibur. Some Hiltons felt better than this. The room was pretty average rough bedsheets only decaf coffee and no room service. Would’ve been alright if I hadn’t been expecting a fancy Vegas experience so if that’s what you want then you need to go all out and stay at The Venetian or Caesar’s Palace. The Luxor is an average hotel nothing fancy about it except for the outside. If you wanted to have a bougie night in wearing your robe and eating room service this hotel has no robe nor room service. But if you just need a decent place to stay the Luxor is. It’s nice but it’s not fancy.
40,The facility was very cool and pretty reasonable for what you got. The staff was very nice all around. I did find the hotel decor dated and the facility had a smokey smell to it especially the bedrooms which sucked. Also we didn't get to use the pool but were still charged a resort fee for everything else. Maybe take a third off the bill next time?
20,Not happy with our stay. Older room. Worn carpet flimsy sheets bed was low to the ground. NO CODFEE MAKER IN ROOM. Pillow case had old dried blood on it. Huge line to store our luggage - we just left early for the airport (5 hrs) rather than wait in that line in the Smokey casinos.
20,Room was at the very end of a hallway by the garage. NO REFRIGERATOR OR MICROWAVE. Who doesn't provide that in this day and age with a room reservation. Couldn't get a late checkout and the line to have them store your baggage after checking out was 1-2 hours. Had to keep our luggage with us for 4-5 hours until we went to the airport.
40,We were in Vegas for a wedding so this was a short stay. The rooms were the most expensive of any time we have stayed in Vegas anywhere. It was a good stay with hotel staff very accommodating. I would stay there again if the cost is more reasonable.
10,From the moment you get in the long line to check in until you hope you don't have to pay another $20 for parking being in this prison will make you feel like an idiot. Food overpriced drinks overpriced rooms seem reasonable until you add on the nessecities! Like flying frontier airlines. Thank you for taking vegas off my bucket list!
40,I stayed at the hotel for a convention that was going on in Mandalay Bay. This was an ideal location because they provide a tram that takes you directly to Mandalay Bay. The room was clean when we got there and the had no issues with staff. The only thing I would say is that we had no fridge or microwave in the room. The hotel was 3 Starbucks so that was a plus.
30,Nice casino and restaurants attached. Rooms are alittle outdated. Some outlets in the rooms did not work (plug ins would just fall out). Elevators shake and took 10 minute waits at times. Location is pretty good on the strip. Check in time can be extensive unless completed online.
30,Hotel room was ok but no fridge but had full size ironing board? Also TV kept freezing had to unplug from the wall to get it to shut off. This was reported but never fixed Also no blankets on the bed just sheets.
30,Mobile check-in did not work which seemed to be a common problem in talking with staff. If staff knows the service doesn’t work it shouldn’t be advertised as available. The smoke from the casino got everywhere even though it was a “non-smoking” room. It was still smokey from the intensity of smoke within the casino.
40,I really enjoyed my stay. Everything was nice and clean. The staff were really friendly and helpful. The bathrooms were clean. The only issue I had was that morning showers water was not as hot as the night showers.
10,This place sucks  Don’t stay here  Charge you for a mini bottle of water  Terrible service  Dirty  Smelly  Parking is a joke and expensive  Can’t use luggage carts  Took an hour to get my bags from valet  Still have yet to get my cover charge back
50,Luxor Hotel & Casino is a cool place to stay. I really like the pyramid and the design of everything. Really unique experience with the elevators and rooms. The staff here is very accommodating and efficient to make sure that you have everything that you need for the best stay.
10,I had a first floor hotel with my gf. First of all the self-parking is literally across the entire casino from the hotel room which made checking in and out a huge nightmare. The room (East Tower) was next to the valet parking which always had taxi drivers honking and the radio playing which made sleeping terrible. About the worst thing is that you have to pay for parking every single time you leave and come in it's only free 1 hour and $15 for 1-4 hours and $18 after that. My gf and I were traveling all the time and ended up wasting over $100 just on parking alone. Unfortunately this seems to be standard practice across all MGM properties so I would avoid them like the plague unless you enjoy throwing money away for parking.    Check out time is also 11AM not 12PM like at most hotels which is stupid as hell. They do not loan you the dolleys to move your stuff to the self-parking so it was a VERY long walk all the way across the hotel for both check-in and check-out. I literally had to drag a trash bag of my stuff (provided by cleaning lady thank you so much!) across the casino to self-parking when I was checking out since I was in such a rush checking out.    There are also no physical room keys. I am an environmentalist so glad they are plastic free but they need to work out the kinks in the app. I have an Android and the 3rd day of the trip the digital key stopped working for me and started working again on the 4th day. Our room door also did not close all the way unless you dragged it closed and toilet would randomly bubble.    I brought a reusable gallon of water and there was also nowhere to fill up my water. None of the water fountains worked and one had a cigarette in it. I asked a bartender to refill it and he told me to refill it in the bathroom in the high limit area which is what I ended up doing.    Wi-fi is also terrible here. Crashed every 10 minutes and sometimes would not connect at all.    Staff also seemed extremely unknowledgeable about the games. I play poker and none of the staff knew where the poker room was or even if there was one (there isn't). Would recommend Venetian if you want to play poker.    I've been told for a long time this is one of the worst hotels in the entire area and that reputation is definitely earned. I would avoid this hotel at all costs. If you are on a budget I'd suggest Home2Suites or a Marriot and if you have the money I'd suggest going to Venetian/Palazzo (which have free parking) or Treasure Island (which has free parking)
50,Excellent overall very memorable trip for a business conference. I would visit again and will recommend family and friends. The price was excellent and very convenient to get a taxi for movabilty. The guys at the front doors and all the taxi service personnel were very professional and courteous.
40,I had a very very good experience with every staff member at Luxor I interacted with......from the front desk to the bell stand to the staff at the dice table. They met my every need.    My only concern was mild in that I was a little far from the Mandalay Bay South Convention center where I needed to spend much time ( and because of the distance didn't have as much access to my room as I would like.
40,Overall stay at Luxor was fantastic only complaint was the Food and service at Tender Steakhouse food was below subpar and service sucked. Do not waste your time at this overpriced disgusting food . There was 5 of us and everyone’s food was so bad we had to go somewhere else to eat when we were done and for a crappy meal that cost $480 is ridiculous!
40,We enjoyed our stay for our first time in Vegas as newlyweds. The staff is very knowledgeable and friendly. The resort has great amenities. The downfall is we didn't have a fridge or microwave for leftovers so we wasted a lot of food.
40,Great staff just no hot water every morning. Check in was smooth on app. Front desk staff was amazing Wifi is not great connection kept failing. no fridge in room but over all good stay. Good location not to far from anything. Good selection of food and other things to do.
40,Very friendly staff throughout the hotel. Housekeeping did great job daily. Many eating options in hours and in mall linking it to Mandalay Bay. MGM Reward program hotel so credit for play in house was a bonus.
40,I fell on the floor and I couldn’t stand up I’m 75 years old my wife called for help at front and the answer was very chill and not human at all “no because liability “ a visual inspection could determine if it was and emergency or not for the hospitality side the came out shot.
50,I loved the experience!! The service was all alround great and anything I needed was taken care of right away. The choices of places to eat were really good too. The table games were fun and open all night. i will be back really soon.
10,Our room was robbed and after an investigation the hotel found our room lock was not working properly. Thai was verified in the presence of hotel management security management myself and my wife. Over $7000.00 of our possessions stolen and they will not accept responsibility. My wife could have been assaulted raped or murdered is she had been alone when the room was entered we both could have been done the same way if we were both present. We had to end out vacation and go home due the trauma my wife is going thru. She could never sleep in that hotel knowing what happened.
10,Are used to really enjoy staying at the Luxor. Not anymore. When I got there in my room faced a cinderblock wall the bathroom towels were in worse shape than the towels I use in my garage there was no water in the room no coffee maker the Jacuzzi tubs are no longer Jacuzzi tubs. They are just bathtubs The closets are too short for dresses there are no decent restaurants open after 10 o’clock at night it appears they have homeless people walking around in the casino and on and on and on. At one point I had to call security because there was a group of people fighting and screaming expletives out in the hallway at 3 AM. I was originally supposed to stay there for five nights but fled after the first night.
50,From check in to any questions we had the staff was so helpful and so friendly? Wish the had more of the old 25 cent machines but they had alot of machines to choose from? Great food court and the Mexican restaurant was out of this world...
50,The service and hotel was great. Staff were very friendly and professional and took care of my needs. Everyone was friendly and knowledgeable of what needed to be done. I would recommend to anyone looking to stay on the strip and location was away from the busy section for both pedestrian and drivers.
50,This pyramid is incredible in fact you can see a laser from the flight in the air it is wonderful the shows are incredible the food is delicious honestly it is a very classy hotel! Love this place!!!!!
50,Staying at the Luxor Hotel was almost an accident. The listed offer was not available for that time. but the Luxor was for one night. Looking back I wish it was longer. The staff from the checking personnel to the dealers to the restaurant personnel to the random staff members to the checkout personnel were all friendly and extremely helpful. Nice rooms fun gaming I didn't see the shows on this trip but the ones I saw before were worth seeing again.
50,Great place to stay for Raiders games!! Short walk to Allegiant easy access. Stayed in East Tower. Comfortable beds clean rooms courteous staff. Good choices for food inside and walkways to Mandalay Bay and Excalibur.
50,Good day  I took a short trip to Las Vegas and suprisingly got impressed about the location. All excuses to verify the day and evening opportunities especially decorationslightening variety of eventseating shopping and casino life.
30,Room did not look as advertised. Room was very dated and dark with limited accessories. No USB port shower only ran warm water no hot water and heater didn't work room never got warm. View was the top of the 5th floor roof!
40,The Luxor was a very affordable option for a decent hotel on the strip. We were in for a family function and were satisfied with our room and the hotel in general... We were overall very satisfied with our stay... we had an issue with the parking on the day of an event at the stadium as the Allegiant Stadium uses the Luxor lot and we ended up being over 30 minutes late to a family dinner.
30,Everything was fine. The cons- poor lighting in bathroom (so it’s hard to get ready to go out) no coffee maker run down and old. Bellman on our way out was great.  I really do not have anything more to say to satisfy 200 characters…
10,I hadn’t stayed at this hotel in nearly 20 years but it was near Allegiant and we came for a football game. Cleanliness was sub par- floor tiles and carpets stained throughout. It’s very obvious so they’re choosing to ignore it. Guest rooms need renovating. Mattresses and pillows are terrible quality. TV channels nearly nonexistent- we wanted it more for background noise and to catch some sports while we got ready but no luck! We called down thinking it was an error but the girl who answered laughed and said ‘we don’t have channels’. There’s no room service; Only the option to pre-order a to go order from a couple restaurants (deli) but the availability is only late night hours. Casino floor bathrooms don’t have working sinks. We ate at Public House. Took nearly 30 min to get a server. Each server we flagged would come to us to say they’re looking for a replacement for our area but instead of helping we continued to wait. Not sure why we were seated in an area that didn’t have a server. A manager (I’m assuming- she was older and one of the first to say she was looking for a server for us) offered to get our drinks started which she did but then we saw them at the bar and still had to wait for a server to bring them. We eventually got “our” server and she only came once. You can imagine the nightmare when we attempted to close out. I walked up to a random server and she was rude to help us get a bill. We had cash and she rolled her eyes when we said we needed change. We saw her walk around a bit so I just asked for my rewards card because it was very clear she was in no hurry to bring us change. Because of this the server easily got a 40% tip as we figured it would be longer to get our change and we were over it. It was disappointment after disappointment. We won’t be returning.
10,I've stayed at the Luxor numerous times but won't make this mistake again from the poor ventilation that causes a stale cigarette smell all the time to go along with an old hotel and some front desk that are just hateful I would recommend staying somewhere else for sure.
20,Extremely expensive for what we got. There was no water or fridge not much for toiletries. The room was extremely noisy at night from the casino and music below not everyone is there to party until 3am. I wish there was a warning about the noise when I booked the room.
10,Just an old outdated property. Elevator is scary you can hear everything when you're trying to sleep. Nothing is really appealing. The only reason to stay here is if you can't afford better. Would not recommend.
30,Have to spend 2 much money on food. Hotel room seemed cramped and no view. Front desk allowed people to cut in front of me during checkout. I wish buffet had a stir fry option during lunch. It would be great to and some veggies and a protein in a bowl an have it prepared like the do the omelettes for breakfast.
30,No mini fridge. TV signal choppy. Not many dining options. Not conveniently located. Too far away from the action. Rooms were decent bed slept well. If you want very low key this is your place. I personally wouldn't pay to stay at the Luxor again unless it was my only option for the strip.
10,Ernesto Alverez RM Coordinator took 3 days to respond to injury. Never once addressed the filth issues. Gave us 4 nts comped 250 food voucher in trade for signed waiver of medical liability. My main complaint within 1 hr of check in was NO TOWELS including hand floor towel/mat & washcloths. Free upgrade for my birthday was actually a down grade from the Staywell room I booked. I don't blame Ernesto directly I blame mismanaged FD employees whom I spoke to several times regarding the above including fall from shower. Again no towels.  With room filth at the level we endured and in the covid era unbelievable. Pics to follow. I'm still waiting on Ernestos response to comp under MGM vs Luxor as we are extremely hesitant to return. MGM referred me back to Ernesto when contacted directly.  No copability
50,The staff was very friendly and helpful. They have great food choices for every palate. From Tender restaurant the buffet Pyramid restaurants and the deli restaurant. One of my favorite is the Public House. They have ribs wings shake and sports. Great trip.
40,The room was nice - nothing great but certainly no where near worth $1000 for a two night stay for their lowest priced room for those nights. $200/nite would have been good. Demand pricing is ridiculous - too bad because it’s a wonderful place to stay.
50,We stayed at Luxor for our first time we had a great experience definitely will go back staff very friendly and helpful. Dean was quick to come and open our safe so we could get on the casino floor and win money lol great restaurants around for all types of great food
50,Had a tower room. Was a great room and updated. Only bad thing about trip was we paid full resort fees when the pool area wasn’t open. The location is ok but there is a little bit of walking to get to the main strip area
20,When checking out I was charged 95$ and was never told what for. Also when checking in was told I would receive a 200$ deposit after checking out and I never got it. Other than that it was an okay stay.
50,Excellent service value and quality. Great location! Selection of restaurants was wonderful. Rooms were spacious and clean. Staff was very friendly. I would definitely stay here again with my family and friends.
50,Great service good room great food rooms clean food great tasting great value staff professional Atmosphere Visually pleasing . Adequate parking. East to travel to on the strip. Manny great views from the room.
40,We travelled to Las Vegas for our wedding and choosing to stay at the Luxor was first for us (we’ve stayed elsewhere twice before) . Although the rooms are a little dated decor wise  they were plenty big enough and very clean ! The only negative thing we can say about our trip this time would be the food prices are very expensive so had to eat and drink elsewhere  which there’s plenty of choice . The staff were very helpful and friendly and made us feel very welcome . All being said a great experience all round .
40,Super Huge resort. Prepare to walk miles each day. Also be prepared if there is a game at Allegiant Stadium they rent out the spaces for 35.00 for event. Hotel goers are forced to find parking way out in BFE or no spaces. No shower gels. Rooms weee nice but did not cool below 70-74 degrees.
20,Room ceiling is very low and there is just one window in the room which barely has any sunlight to pass. In addition there is smell of cigarettes in the lobby and is just no good for family stay l. Won’t be back in this property unfortunately
40,I’ll be staying at the Luxor for years to come. My kind of people. I spend a lot of time at the tables and the minimum bets are low. Food was so good at all the restaurants especially Diablo’s. I’d stay in the pyramid from now on walls arnt paper thin there.
20,Really cool hotel and casino but ….staff is uninspired to provide any type of customer service. From check in to service at the bar to dining. The staff couldn’t care less if you were there or not. Too many other hotel options for this location to operate this way.
40,Chill place to stay and has allot of things to do close by. Good restaurantsshows and not overcrowded. I wished i could of stayed farther away from the elevator but afar from that my stay was really good
50,We recently hosted a business meeting at Luxor. This property was great every step of the way. Kathy Salazar was my first point of contact for sales and she was amazing. We had a fantastic experience pre-meeting planning and a highly successful event on-site. Thank you Luxor for exceeding my expectations.
50,Love this place everyone was awesome we had a good experience close to shops and restaurants I didn’t have a negative thing to say the pharaohs cafe had the best service the employees were top notch on their service will definitely come back
50,Stayed at Paris for 3 days out of our 5 day trip & let me just say that Luxor will always be top tier when it comes to either one of these two hotels. Beds at Paris were rock hard pillows flimsy and not comfortable at all. Luxor beds felt amazing! And the pillows omg! Check in experience was very very fast & they accommodated me very well
50,We go to Vegas 2-3 times a year. Stay primarily with MGM properties. Stayed at mirage and bellagio last time. Decided to stay on other side of strip. Luxor was a great experience. They have clean rooms and very nice staff. Very underrated shows as well. Blue man group carrot top and Americas got talent were a lot of fun. Speaking for underrated their steak house was incredible.
50,Dbjejwkcifjjwkcifjenxoofhrbwkaooaoz9eu829e0tongncnieiw9i3jrbgncjxiueh2b4nti8c773h4bnvkvos8qyb2ir8t74920ochfbn2k1o49u4h4bjfkv9r8u2yh4jvo9e82yy3h5btkvo9d8w6wy3gb5myov0d97aywg3btnvlochfhejdicurhendifurheu
10,From torn carpets damaged tables & chairs stains on the walls exposed wiring by vanity in our suite #10345 in East tower is what we experienced. It's too bad because the atmosphere of the Luxor is really cool. Elevators Bar Areas all need upgrading. Most restaurants don't open until 8am and buffet is closed a couple of days a week.
10,No blankets there was no blankets in my room. The heater was not working I was disappointed that my room was not as accommodating as other times with amenities. There was only sheets. The app wasn't working to read for the door to unlock and for parking. It was disappointing.
30,Good price but out of date no amenities yet charged resort fees. No comps. Was not clear on what the extra fees were for. When asked about comps got a flat no. Drinks took forever when gaming. Elevator or inclinator was old and broken in some.
10,POOR ! Missing carpet broken doors not one USB connection late checkin no coffee in room no fridge  Only good thing was the bed.  Room was antiquated.  Asked for adjoining rooms 2 months in advance and offered me rooms 5 floors different.  Finally got 2 rooms side by side but were POOR!  Use to stay there often over the years but no more !
10,Just overall poor customer service. Many of the staff seemed to be bothered when asking for assistance with directions recommendations or clarification of rules/policies. Some staff were just acting as if they had an attitude and it was a problem for you to be in need...
50,The rooms were spacious! The staff were very professional and took care of all our needs! We felt like VIP's! They had a great casino and the buffet was very tasty!~We loved hoe the hallways got smaller as we ascended the Pyramid!
40,My favorite hotel on the strip. Great value great service very helpful with any problems. Wonderful beds. Comfortable space. Rooms are clean. Hidden gem of an all night cafe great food and cost conscious.
20,The hotel itself looks very nice and I was happy to stay at such an attractive location. My room was placed on an off site tower though and very far from the action and excitement of the hotel / casino. Not much worth the cost of the hotel for accommodations like that.
20,The housekeeping staff was nice when I checked in the gentleman was very nice gave me a $75 credit. I tried to use it at the Mexican restaurant in the lobby and apparently I was charged anyway. They charged it to my room and did not even acknowledge my credit when I try to tell the gentleman at checkout that this was the case he basically handed me my receipt and didn't say anything else. Outside of the chicken person in the housekeeping staff everyone else was rude
40,It's not the Wynn or venetian but we enjoyed comped 1 bdrm tower suite and casino and location to NYNY & Mandalay Bay. If u want center strip it's easy to pick up Uber tram walk etc Needs 24hr restaurants tho
20,Our room had no usb ports for charging devices not even an alarm clock with one or anything. No microwave no fridge very bare bones. Had to go to the essentials store on the main floor to buy a $30 (eye roll) usb plug-in port. Ridiculous it’s 2022. Motel 6 has usb ports…
50,This was an awesome trip.    Had an excellent experience from an easy checkin to great room with fantastic amenities and great staff. The suite I had was excellent with lots of space. I loved it. Highly recommend Luxor
10,Lukewarm water in the shower.  No tea/coffee machine in the room.  TV Channels selection is poor  No concierge service on the premises (you have to go to Mandalay Bay 15 minutes walk one way through smoke filled casino floor).  Tables in the restaurant (Diablo something) not clean and floor is dirty.  Overall impression from the hotel - it is old and weared down.  Also maybe give some consideration for the Egyptian/Mediterranean cuisine maybe offer some good falafel for a change.  All in all - for your money you can find better lodging options on the Strip.
10,Not cleaned daily not compensated for broken word of room upgrades. Never plan on stay here again. Staff was very rude about everything we asked and told them. Do not recommend staying here to anyone.
30,Stayed at Luxor. Had visited 30 years prior hoping some day to stay. Was disappointed with dated room dated plumbing (sewage backed up in shower pan and water was turned off at night to bathroom). Accosted very often while walking thru lobby areas with people trying to sell me everything under the sun.
50,This is my third time staying at The Luxor while in Vegas. I love this hotel! The rooms are nice and clean and the staff and the casino are excellent. The hotel is perfectly positioned between two other hotels as well where you can easily enjoy the activities in those.
10,We have been coming to this place for the past eight years and this trip was the worst one ever denied valet front desk did not care instead they try to give us free stuff that we already had with our MGM resort membership elevators are a joke you feel like you’re going to die by getting into them and the hotel rooms have a butt hole shower and there’s a TV on one side of the wall blocked by a huge dresser cabinet so you only can see the TV from one side fun times
20,The hotel is great atmosphere popping. 90% of the time while trying to shower we were without hot water. Where our room was located you could hear and feel the music blaring honestly thought I was at a concert. I know it’s Vegas but I at least expected to be able to sleep decently but i never got a goods nights rest.
40,well i loved getting to corner pyramid room with a soaking tub. the check in was great. but the room a/c was messed up and it wouldnt cool. the water saver? on the sink faucet wouldnt put out enough water. and the bedwas pretty bouncy. ill be back again cause i like the luxor
10,I never received my room service and never came and cleaned my room during my whole entire stay after I requested it be done..my wife is pregnant and got very sick so I couldn’t leave her side and we never had food delivered to our room nor room service for clean Leon and etc
20,"Checked in today for our Anniversary. First time in Vegas so was hoping for a good visit. Julie at check in desk was awesome and got us a room to check into a bit early with the strip view as requested (26121).... That's when things went south. Just to be clear those 2 stars are for Julie because she was awesome and extremely friendly otherwise I wouldn't even give it one star at this point. We went up to our room and although the room itself was nice it was 87° in the room and heat was rolling out of HVAC unit. The ac was set at 65 but evidently wasn't working right. I opened a ticket with service to see if they could look at the unit as I had to prop the door open so I didn't have a heat stroke in there. An hour later I went down to Bell desk and ask the status. The lady said all tickets go in a queue so they couldn't give me a time when they'd be there & told me to wait in check in line again to switch rooms no empathy at all there... After waiting in line another 1/2 hour for check in desk. That lady was even ruder. She was like they can't give a time can't you just go somewhere else for a while? NO Karen I've been up since 2am and flew across the country... want to rest in a cool room. She's like I don't know what to tell you you're just going to have to wait and maybe go somewhere else and if they can't fix it they'll put you in another room then. I WAS LIVID at this point. I spent over $1K on a room and this is how they treat their guests??  She said no other rooms were available so I asked to speak with someone else as I knew this was a complete BS answer. ""She"" spoke to someone behind her and he shook his head and she then gave me another room  (12040). We get to this room and there's hair all over the bathroom no strip view but at this point I just don't have anymore fight in me and I need to sleep... After I write this review as a warning for others that is. $1K may not be much for some but this was an Anniversary splurge for my wife and so far ir sucks. Again Julie is a rockstar not so much the other staff I engaged with."
50,Good value of money awesome beds and clean room  the staff was very friendly also the view of our room was excellent. Good food and nice bar. We don’t have any problems and totally come back again..
50,Check in was friendly and we were offered a room up grade at the desk for a reasonable price to a pyramid corner suite . The room was spotlessly clean and comfortable  we had a fridge we could put our own drinks in which was great . Room was really peaceful and no noise what so ever . Luxor Casino was good  a short walk to Mandalay bay casino which was brilliant . This was the 2nd half of our trip  we’d stayed at the Bellagio for the 1st half . A great stay at Luxor and will definitely return 😊 .
40,I enjoyed staying at The Luxor Hotel and Casino. The room was good front desk service at check in was great. I only had one night and I got a great deal on Expedia and I would stay again. I arrived early but the lady who checked me in was very helpful and got me checked in straight away.
40,Staff at check-in and throughout our trip were great! Super friendly and helpful. We stayed in a pyramid room conveniently located near the elevator. Beds and bathroom need upgrades otherwise it was clean and roomy. Casino paid alright.
50,This was my first time traveling to Vegas.  Everything was very accessible at the Luxor and very easy to navigate.  All of the staff were amazing and went above and beyond.  One of the best experiences travelling I have ever had  The room was large the bathroom was spacious and clean no end to the hot water and the location was perfect.  It may be at the South end of the strip but it is close to bus stops ride share waits are short and plenty of restaurants and shopping within walking distance. And it was a short trip to and from the airport that made coming and going a breeze.
40,Arrival and check-in was easy valet parking was quick Bell hops were attentive and expedient. The room was clean nice and well stocked. The slot was kept clean along with the machines. All the staff was friendly fast and courteous
50,I love the Luxor the pyramid specifically. I have never stayed in the tower because it's the pyramid that drew me here and it's so unique I keep coming back. Some people say it's too far away from everything but there's a bus stop right out front and I prefer to be out of the hub when trying to sleep. No matter how solid your hotel mid strip you're GOING to hear outside
50,It was a fun and great experience especially the suites I had a whole lot of fun and will be definitely booking again soon and I advise everyone to get a room on a weekday very cheap and affordable and worth it
10,The room temperature was not working. The room was freezing cold. We requested the managers (talked to multiple) for repair or change in the room. Their response was that no rooms were available. My partner fell sick because of this. She is still ill from the Luxor freezer. Horrible room amenities and zero care from managers. Would not recommend this hotel. Right before this I stayed at Mirage and they had exceptional service and quality of room. Any issue was catered to within minutes
20,With a week long stay at the property. We contacted housekeeping multiple times for the same issue of allergies too bedding. It took over 24 hours for a response that was only a phone call. No resolution ever. Our resolution was to go buy our own. Hotel is supposed to be non smoking however we had people definitely smoking on our floor.
20,The rooms were clean. The casino was cleaning well ventilated with great app to monitor rewards points. The showers were miserable out of 5 days only had hot water for 1 morning. The elevators feel like they will fall soon. Make sure you get room key since your digital phone key only works on 2 of 4 elevators.
40,We stayed in a West Tower suite on the 15th floor. Room 15274 had a good view but did not have a microwave oven. Only suites had coffee pots so we did have a 1 cup at a time pot. Everything was clean and service very good.
50,Extremely accommodating resort. Friendly staff someone is always willing to help. The hotel is very reasonably priced and very well kept. I am very pleased with my stay. Also they made it very easy to check into my room.
40,MGM Rewards gives awesome comps to stay at the Luxor and it was nice to actually have a coffee maker and working mini-fridge in room - most Strip hotels lack both. However there is no dine-in room service available and the restaurant selection at the Luxor is poor. Also the property is getting old and upkeep is lacking. But for the value and extra conveniences the Luxor is definitely worth considering.
20,The room was a nice size. no water for the duration of the stay. Room did not get cold at all. hotel is far from the main strip. not much to do in the area. stayed in pyramid 1 bedroom suite. the soaking tub never had hot water either
10,Luxor hotel needs to shut down some floors of their hotel and revamp it. The filters have not been changed in the rooms in years And the amount of dust and dirt in the rooms shows it. We asked for the room to be cleaned and were threatened with trespassed twice Worst trip I've ever been on in my life
50,Excellent location! Casino is great and the tables ( Roulette and Black Jack) had a arrange of table cost. The sleeping rooms were clean and linens were high quality. Loved the variety of restaurants from the buffets to the steak house nice variety of restaurants .
30,No drinking water in room. No refrigerator. I call front desk and asked and I was told I could rent fridge for $25 and water was available in vending machines. No extra pillows in room. I called housekeeping and they came up with blankets. I explained I wanted pillows and they finally brought pillows. I paid $30 online for late checkout 3pm. I arrived at my room at 230 but could not get in. Apparently they already checked me out. After 15 minutes at front desk they extended my time until 4 pm. I was not charged for late checkout. Room was clean and functional. Casino was dark and dreary. Food was expensive. I spent one day downtown where casinos were nice and the food very reasonable. Much more like the old Vegas. I would not stay at Luxor again and probably not anywhere on strip. Strip hotels all charge $40-60 daily resort fees which must be added to advertised price
20,Lobby and overall main area gorgeous! Rooms? Disgusting. Wallpaper peeling. Paint bubbled peeling and chipping. Lamps near broken and dusty. Inside of the curtains are greasy and filthy. Considering cleanliness protocols have updated and gotten more thorough due to a global pandemic this was just unacceptable. They need to update their cleaning policies and update/fix the rooms….especially for the price.
40,Bathroom needs updating overall good experience for 4 day stay. Checked in and out through app which was convenient and easy. Restaurant closed too early. Enjoyed the sports bar and drinks. Hotel was clean
50,I had luck on the slot machines. The food at the Pyramid Cafe was great. My room had a great view of the pool the mountains and a side view of the new football stadium. The location on the strip is perfect.
10,Screaming baby in adjoining room. Thin walls made it hard to sleep with a noisy neighbor . No coffee pot. No fridge. Flakey internet TV system. Climate controls can't switch from cooling to heating without a maintenance visit.
10,Poor customer service! I hope you get lucky and they retrain their staff.  Checking out a nightmare long lines and too machines by the arking tunnel don't get mislead by the front desk signs the two staff members they will point you to use the machines your business is not appreciated.
30,Find another hotel would be my advice. Elevators are a pain rooms are in disrepair.bed was a sinkhole with no support. The blue man group was the only thing I would return for. They were five stars. The Pyramid cafe was horrible also.
50,Will definitely stay at Luxor for my next visit. Im so excited to go back. Me and my partner had an amazing experience everyone was very friendly. Already planning our next visit to Vegas and we are definitely staying at Luxor again.
10,First time staying here and I heard bad things about the place but I wanted to give it a try myself to see what the experience is like. First thing once I checked in the bathroom door was broken. My room has no added security of a lock from the inside which makes sleeping at night a lil fearful that anyone can come in at anytime. The WiFi situation was horrible as well once it inside the room my cell data would never work so I tried to utilize their wifi which sadly never worked either .. will not stay again here
50,For the cost this was a very nice property and provided great value. Hotel staff went above and beyond for me to provide an exceptional stay. The diagonal elevators were very unique and I really enjoyed riding them. Artifacts and decorations make you feel like you are getting an authentic Egyptian experience. The only downside was that I didn't win any money at this property.
40,Service and facilities were exceptional. The view both of the montains and of the pyramid from the interior balconies was phenomenal. Good selection of machines.    However food in both the buffet and diablo restaraunt were subpar. Not as many quick eats options as other places we've stayed on the strip.
30,"first time at luxor. my wife and i booked with luxor to celebrate my birthday. we were told it was a great hotel. the entire time we were there the experience was terrible. we rented a suite floor 21 room 081. the first night there were children running up and down the room next door crying and jumping all over the place we were barely able to sleep. the next day it was a different guest in the same room this time screaming yelling and things getting thrown around the room at 5 in the morning. at 8 a lady and security were knocking and banging to get into the room next door claiming she was locked out with no proof of her staying at the hotel. they proceed to knock on my door i answer and the women trys to walk in but get in the way and security asked ""do you know this women?"" i say ""no"" and begin to close door. they leave when we are getting ready to check out the women comes back to the room and is now kicking the door punching and yelling trying to get in. our room was shaking thats how hard she was hitting the door. my wife calls for security but the has a slow react time so we decided to leave since we were on our way to check out. As we open the door the lady shoves my wife and makes her way into OUR room 081 and shuts the door. i then speak to a housekeeping worker to inform her of the situation and she calls security. the security team comes up to room and breaches our room only to find out she broke into the room next door through the share door to the adjoining room. they asked if we wanted to press charges and said ""No we just want to make sure nothing is damaged and we get charged"". from what we know the lady was arrested. but never would i have thought that something like that would have happened. i thought by renting a suite the experience would be nicer. im not sure if i would stay here again after that experience i know it can happen anywhere but just not excited when i think of luxor."
10,It was nasty the bathtub was nasty the room was nasty the casino was nasty the public bathrooms were nasty and the staff were not helpful and even hung up when called down to complain. NEVER AGAIN!!!
20,No refrigerator for leftovers no bottled water horrible tasting sink water and bathroom plug kept blowing shutting off all of the lights/electricity. This was a celebratory trip and our rooms were the biggest disappointment.
20,I had multiple issues with my room; safe not working tv remote not working AC/Heat not working & no room phone. Also one place for elevators per certain floors and more than likely need to walk a ways to get to your room. I’m an MGM Rewards member who went to the desk to get my free play loaded but they didn’t load my food/dining credits. I guess I needed to ask for that separately. I leveled up to Platinum status and was not given benefit information regarding my new tier status when I requested a new card. Which could’ve been helpful. Don’t get me wrong I love the MGM resorts & player programs it was just a fail at this resort. This is the first time I stayed at Luxor and normally at the other MGM resorts I don’t/didn’t have all these issues. Positives: The Food Court was decent there were different things to do and the Egyptian vibe was great! Just know this is an older resort and if you’re looking for modern/upgraded rooms-this is not the place.
20,Disappointed in room resort fees and lack of cleanliness in room. This was a trip for my son's soccer tournament and really it was a shame that you didn't want to go back the hotel room as it wasn't clean or equipped with anything great in it.
50,Where else can you escape for 4 days and attend not 1 not 2 but 3 Las Vegas Golden Knights hockey games!??! We just love visiting Vegas and soaking up the atmosphere lights entertainment (FANTASY rules!).
10,So gross. Don’t stay here. Cockroaches in our room dirty stains smells like crap and cigarettes. I called immediately after getting to the room and the front desk said there were no more rooms. We had the 850 sq ft corner suite. So we checked out and went across the way to the Delano hotel. The Delano was fabulous and amazing service. I will be back to the Delano.
50,I had a good time and I will surely be back! Very convenient place to stay and they do well on giving good incentives to come back. I also love their gym!!! Next time I’ll come with my lady I know she will like and appreciate the experience as much as I have.
40,I booked two rooms at the Luxor for Thanksgiving week. Both rooms in thr pyramid were clean. The hotel staff were kind as well. Our Heater didn't work but they sent a mechanic up right away and it was a simple problem to fix. We are convinced the hotel is haunted though. My sister felt her blanket being pulled off her and what felt like a hand rubbing her cheek. The elevators also appeared to have a mind of their own opening on floors they were not supposed to or not opening on our floor. We did get stuck in the elevator once as the doors refused to open on our floor. After waiting 10 minutes I was able to get the elevator to return to the casino floor and let me out. I notified a security officer that was standing outside the elevators and took a different elevator up to my room. Overall though I would stay at Luxor again. Ghosts don't really bother me.
20,This hotel really needs to upgrade everything was very outdated. The room had an old musty smell. The bed was very worn out couldn't get the heat to come on and it took maintenance well over an hour before anyone came to address the issue.
20,Have stayed many of times and always satisfied not this time things have gone way down hill. Beds uncomfortable elevator dirty and banged up.overall property is in bad shape. Just doesn't feel clean.
20,I always stay at the Luxor not only have I spent over 100000 this year alone I'm also a VIP. I frequently have trouble with housekeeping and the rooms overall. I've also never been treated so poorly by management in my life. I can't believe I was actually told to stay at another hotel.....
50,My husband and I recently stayed here and we really love this hotel. During this trip we stayed in a nice room in the East Tower where we had a view of the strip and the mountains. We had a great breakfast at the Pyramid Cafe and the best burger we have ever had at the Public House Restaurant. We enjoyed gambling at the casino and shopping at the various places in the Luxor Mandalay Bay Excalibur etc.
50,Luxor is really fancy and nice looking. Is like being in Egypt but better. You don’t have to travel out there to have the experience of it. I really like it. I definitely recommend it to anyone who is looking for something new and different. Love it
50,We have been staying at the Luxor for years. The one time our room was not clean (bathroom was dirty and it smelled like weed) we were upgraded to a nicer room free of charge. The rooms in the tower are worth the extra few dollars per night.
50,My family and I had a great time at the Luxor. Definitely going back! Staff was super friendly and lets not forget helpful. Rooms are very clean and well maintained. Would definitely recommend this to anyone planning on going.
30,The room had a very strong urine smell and the sheets and pillows were old. This is the major issue. Otherwise should be a very nice experience. Check in experience was very good and the lady was very patient to us and explained us in detail. Staff at parking was helpful .
30,Elevators didn’t fully work and casino has no dance club. Lots of broken facilities items. The walkable tramway was down and parking structure was full even though hotel wasn’t booked. Had to park a hotel over.
40,Now we have maximum Horus power. Falcon God superhero vibes strong. Slept like Ramses II. Isis and Osiris visit was eerie but we steeled ourselves in the focused sunbeam from Ra and ascended into the heavens.
50,Rooms were very comfortable. Checking in and out on the app was very easy and getting a room key from a kiosk was also easy. Water pressure was by far the best from any other hotel I have stayed at! Staff was also very friendly.
10,TV’s were horrible. Image was grainy and not clear. Holes and scratched paint on the walls. Couch was broken missing pillows. Big holes in the carpet floor like an indentation was covered up. Walk in shower door would not close  So water would splash out onto the floor causing the bath mat to be soaked when I would finish my shower. Shower drain was loose and could be picked up and moved around. I wanted to take a bath in the bathtub jacuzzi but it had a rusted drain and a crack/hole in the side of the tub. I enjoyed the casino and entertainment shows (blue man group) but I definitely would not stay there in a room. Was very disappointed for paying $800+ for the suite (room #28058).
50,Restroom is very clean. Shower is very strong. Beds are comfortable. The room’s furnitures seem a bit not so modern but it didn’t matter to us. Overall it is an wonderful experience staying inside the pyramid.
30,It was an okay experience at Luxor. Actual room was clean and nice. heater wasnt working properly in the room and nobody really repaired it. Housekeeping came in though we said no Housekeeping part of webcheck in. Valet Parking folks were very rude and not helpful at all. Front desk staff were very friendly and helpful.
30,The sink was clogged when we came in. Since we literally just checked in and finding out about the sink problem we asked to change the room. However request was denied. We were told that a plumber will come in to fix it. After it was fixed the sink wasn’t cleaned; it was left with dirt and hair that came out of the clogged sink.
40,First time we stayed at Luxor. Many people on Facebook said it was old dirty dingy. We loved it! It was clean and had a great casino. Restaurants were fantastic.  My only complaints: Cocktail waitress? What cocktail waitress. Never saw one.    The toilet was super low. Like day care / small child height. If you’re over 4ft 5in it’s a long way down. I have bad arthritis in my knees. This was painful to use. Embarrassing when my husband had to help me on and off the toilet. Caused too much pain so we left early. Next time I’ll get a handicap room.    Shower is wonderful. Great pressure. Just don’t shower early in the day when it’s crowded. ( day after thanksgiving). No hot water.
40,Worst part is the very limited parking. You have to keep waiting for someone to leave to get a spot. At any point in the night there are about ten cars waiting to park. Even at midnight nothing changes. It's nerve wracking.
10,I reserved a room for $60 but they charged me over $200 for my room. Everyone I talk to is rude and never answers my questions. I have tried talking to the front desk online and have even called them! It’s a scam! Never again! Do not go here!
20,With all the money the hotel makes they can afford to put a microwave and a refrigerator in every room and not charge occupants an 18.00 a day parking fee. And the air conditioner constantly shuts off on its own even when it’s set to constant fan.
40,One of the better Las Vegas hotels on the south end. Great location for family shows that tend to stay on the south end of the strip. Blue man group was awesome to see at the Loxur! Easy to get to shows at other local hotels through the connecting halls!
20,For a premier room didn't feel premium at all. Didn't have any toilet paper in our room called and was on hold for 15 minutes. Was told it would be sent right up and didn't arrive for 1.5 hours. Room was extremely dusty there were long hairs on the desk as well. Wiped the lamps and headboard down with a damp cloth to try and control the dust.  Very noisy at night could hear the base from the music played in the hotel so didn't sleep well but my partner was able to rest.  No conditioner or liquid body wash in the room (only conditioning shampoo and soap bars) so bring your own.  Would have loved an acknowledgement that we were on our honeymoon.
40,My stay at Luxor was very comfortable and priced right. I would stay there again on my next Vegas trip. Carrot Top was a fantastic show and the casino had all of the machines that I wanted to play. I would recommend to everyone.
50,Excellent location amenities clean room but not the hallways because the trash cans on the lobby have never been picked up on the regular basis. They are overflowing most of the time. The buffet is good.
50,We enjoyed our stay as stated our room a bit of a long walk but awesome quiet worth the walk. Nice shower area and plenty of clean towels for two-night stay. We will look forward to another stay come soon.
40,Staff is nice beware of the parking fees no good room views no refrigerator or microwave. Lots of restaurants the hotel is bigger than its looks. The roulette wheel workers were not friendly at all had to call for a manager at one because of their rudeness.
40,The room had a used cup on the floor when we arrived and sometimes at night there were some strong food smells (like cooking onions) but otherwise we slept well and would go back. No refrigerator. :(
20,Old dates rooms motel 6 at best no mini fridge tv volume limited to a whisper lack of any decent food options Smokey casino just not an enjoyable place to stay luckily it’s connected to mandalay bay where there’s a lot more fun to be had better bars better food better environment. Would not stay here again
10,Not worth the money. Terrible view. Cheap looking for the price. 2nd hand furniture. Had a king suite but it was trash. Do not recommend this hotel. Also did not have a coffee machine microwave or fridge in rooms. The bathtub was filthy and would not drain properly.
50,It was a great stay and would recommend anyone to give it a stay. It was a great experience through and through. Top notch establishment and friendly staff! Location of the hotel is conveniently close to the other hotels/restaurants/and even the Raiders station
50,I loved the location and overall experience at the hotel. I only checked in for one night because I had to meet my in-laws in California. I would stay again I just wish I knew about the room not having a microwave refrigerator or iron
50,Everything was just about perfect. The room was quiet and comfortable the inclinator elevator was cool and the food was good and reasonable. The only thing I didn't like was the parking as it was a relatively long walk from the parking garage to my room. Also I didn't like the smoke in the casino.
40,family reunion all in the room close by. The only disappointment is no dinner buffet that we used to enjoy together as a family. The $100 reward should be able to be used on the Hotel buffet not on the restaurants in the property. The wakeup call did not workout I got up myself anyway. With now a day Covid 19 smoking should be prohibit. Why we have to worry about the smoker not to many people is smoking now; the airlines used to worry about the smoker but look at it now airlines are doing well with the passengers and every are happy way from the smoker. The casino will be better off with clean air and the casino business will be more family oriented just like all the airlines are free off the smokers at least you will have my family as your customer without hesitation.
30,Staff are very nice but rooms are noisy. Crowded. No microwaves and no coffee options but double priced Starbucks with long lines. Gym is good.. use it since the resort fee is mandatory. It does not include sauna and hot tub that is extra. We like to wind down and relax at night but can hear load music and noise from casino in room all night.
30,We stay at the Luxor 11/22/22-11/23/22 in the West Tower and I can honestly say it's time to remodel the rooms. The rooms can use a very good cleaning in the meantime. Night stand was dirty lamps were dusty dirt and debris in corners needed to be vacuumed caulking around shower bottom was peeling off in big chunks hard water stains on shower faucet just to name a few thing that were visible. These rooms do no have a mini fridge or iron. Over all I was very disappointed in our room. Glad it was for only 2 nights. I also find it very sad that resort fee were more than the actual cost of the room. Maybe it is a good thing that Mirage bought them out.    As for the customer service yea not that great or friendly.
50,Stayed at Luxor in a 2 bedroom suite in west tower rooms were very clean and the value for the suite compared to other hotels on strip was unbeatable if you plan to stay around Luxor Mandalay Bay Excalibur it’s perfect even walking over to NyNy isn’t bad. Would stay again for the value. Easy walk inside to  Mandalay Bay maybe 5 min to see Michael Jackson One from the Luxor and a lot of food choices between the two hotels.
50,I like the hotel ambience and staff friendliness as well as the location. It has all sort of facilities service and amazing view. Staff is also friendly. I love the hotel and recommend the same to others.
50,We stayed two different nights (sequential Fridays). The first visit we were upgraded and put in a tower. The second stay we got the pyramid room that we'd reserved. Both rooms were very nice. Clean updated no bad smell/no hair/no bugs. The sheets were incredibly soft and the pillows were ok. The buffet is only open for brunch but it was delicious. The buffet is a little pricey but all food service (restaurant) bills seem to have doubled and tripled in Vegas so the price was comparable to other brunch buffets. We would definitely stay at the Luxor again.
30,No roomm amenities. Hair dryer did not work. No refrigerator old TV no dirty clothes bag no alarm clock just not what we expected for the price paid. Check in was great room was clean nice shower casino was fun and the location was good.
10,Disappointed that carpet was frayed walls dusty no refrigerator. Elevators had an odor unhappy to see sheets with stains (makeup?). Buffet was average waited a very long time for luggage rack (Bell service) to the point I got charged extra from my limo service for having to wait so long. Very outdated.
50,Friendly & accommodating staff. Was given my complimentary upgrade to a suite when I asked due to my Gold status. The suite was clean & spacious but could probably use a little remodel. It has a very fun vibe!Overall it’s a great place to stay!
50,We had a pyramid room with 2 double beds. It was large warm and clean. The bathroom was good with double shower that was powerful. Room seemed to have been a smokers room at some point as I felt like a could still detect smoke but it didn’t cause me issues but could put some people off.  Really wished I’d packed coat hangers as there were only 6!    We ate at the Public House and had the best Vegan Burgers ever. We also ate at Diablos and enjoyed evening meal and returned for lunch snacks a second day. We had the breakfast buffet twice (we had MyVEGAS slots vouchers making it BOGOF) but we felt this buffet was no where near as nice as the Excalibur buffet next door. Would have felt ripped off were it not for the vouchers. We had vouchers for Excalibur too but would have valued it at full price also.  Found Luxor buffet had limited vegetarian choices unless you love omelette which were very nice.    Overall we found the Luxor was a slightly less frantic hotel and casino than visiting somewhere like the NewYork NewYork. We enjoyed this aspect of the hotel feeling it was a great place to head back to after the strip.
50,My overall experience was great but what couldve made it exceptional was warmer rooms. With thermostat on 80° room wasn't warm and no benefit for 1st time visitor to Vegas. Other than that I had a goid time.
40,Hotel was great got the wrong room booked a king bed and got two queens and wasn't told in advance about the expensive parking so wasn't happy right off the bat but otherwise everything else was good. Biggest buffet I've ever seen friendly staff clean rooms.
10,There was a lot of extra charges. Like spa charges even if you don't want to use it. It would of been cheaper to stay somewhere else. Having hot water  wifi or tv was hit or miss . Waited 30 minutes to talk to the front desk.
40,we have stayed at the Luxor previously in the pyramid this time we choose the tower... a little farther walk from casino but loved the wetter with fridge! worth it to me! Clean and the casino was great with great drink service!
50,I love the scent if the hotel when you first walk in lije tgey are taking you into the Egyptian times with the aroma. I like the scenery as well its like stepping into a whole new atmosphere. The staff is really friendly and acomnadating.I stayed in the West Towers where its like a maze to get to your room but once inside the newly renovated rooms are stunning! I loved the showers the water hits your skin and it feels so comforting abd after wards yoir skin so soft. The bed was a bit low but soft and the pillows are so soft you just sink into them. I loved the fact they had the tram for commuting to the other hotels especially if your someone who isnt big on walking! Itll connect you to Mandalay Bay and Excalibur. I also loved the Food Court I ate at Diablos Cantina the nachos and burritos are to die for and at Nathans their salads are great and a nice size for the amount! If you havent been to Luxor your missing out!!!!!
40,Very pleased with comfort of the room especially the king bed. Cleaning stars was on point and attentive. Struggled to have consistent hot water for showers. The hotel fit the feel of Las Vegas and was pleased it wasn’t overwhelmed with smoke. Wish all elevators were working for our area in the hotel.
40,Love the staff at the Luxor and the proximity to the free tram Riding the tram to the last stop really helps your feet out while continuing to visit stores on the strip so take advantage whenever possible. The fajita at Diablos is plenty for two people and delicious and the mgm rewards let’s you try a variety of food or drinks without breaking the bank.
30,Rooms were decent and bed’s comfortable jjust found the general areas kind of rundown and aging. Inside the elevators the access doors to controls were busted and taped with black electrical tape automatic doors for the entrance and exits barely worked.
20,Property needs serious updating- to everything…including the housekeeping. Holes in ceiling. Rips in carpet. TV channels looked like the rabbit ears needed adjusting. Bathroom was filthy- black mold? all over toilet when we arrived.
50,Rooms are very nice and beds are very comfortable. It's a short walk (or take tram) to Mandalay and Excalibur. From Excalibur it's a short walk to New York New York. Great selection of slot machines.
50,I don't typically embrace non-human check-in with kiosks failing as often as they work typically requiring staff assistance in the end anyway but the mobile app made everything from check in check out and parking a breeze. We had our room assigned before we got there with instructions about exactly how to get to it.    The location just off the end of the strip was nice too. No thumping music (it was as if the room was sound proof) or difficulty accessing the parking garage and a reasonable 1.5 mile walk to the other end of the strip.
50,This was yet another great trip. Luxor is at a great location has nice recently renovated rooms and has a great casino. For our group Luxor is one of our favorite places to stay. The food between Mandalay and Luxor is delicious as well.
20,The hotel itself was in major disrepair. There were holes in the stucco on walls. Unrepaired torn wallpaper. The cigarette smoke in the room from the casino was unbearable. Soundproofing of rooms from casino was nonexistent.
30,Luxor hotel overall is nice. However our room did not have a microwave or refrigerator. The carpet and decor were obviously and in need of renovations. There were holes in the walls outside of the room.
40,The shower was to die for. Bathroom was very clean and room was great for the price . Please remove carpet from  Hallways . Too hard to roll luggage .The food was good for  The prices at the restaurants. I liked  The openness of the lobby area. Witness a 34000 jackpot and that was amazing !
30,I went out to valet parking To get medication out of inside vehicle driver side back window lift down which was unbelievable I just let it ride the valley attendant was with me he lit up the window window lift down all night overnight
10,I would highly recommend choosing a different hotel for your Vegas experience. The room was filthy the staff did not seem to care and once we switched to a new room we were met with key card issues. Save your money go somewhere where you will be appreciated as a customer. Spend your money and have fun somewhere else!
40,We married at MGM (Grand) in Late 2009; we have returned every year for our anniversary and stayed at an MGM facility. This was our first negative experience because of one unprofessional staff member.
50,Had a great experience staying at the Luxor. The hotel and room were nice staff was great and hotel upkeep was amazing. Enjoyed sitting in the Sportsbook and watching games also Public House has some amazing food.
50,Have been coming to Vegas and staying at Luxor every year for over 20 years. Hotel is well run and a good value. Miss not having a poker room which has happened at other properties as well. Situated nicely between Mandalay and Excalibur.
30,Paid for parking in the hotel when we booked but when we got to parking garage the parking bar would not work. The lady said push button so we did but to get out we had to pay. So we did that each time and paid each time. And Luxor still charged $18/day for parking in our hotel charges along with hotel surcharge of $35!! Rip off!!
10,Upon checkin to our room we inspected beds and discovered used condoms and the box under the mattress other bed had a broken lotion pump dispenser. Called to inform front desk and was told we'd be moved to a new room. Waited over 30 minutes to get moved into a new dirty room used towels on dresser tub leaked.
50,Everything was great. Clean room nice view huge bathtub. I highly recommend the corner room. Checking in and out was extremely easy.. The restaurant Diablos was also great. Plenty to see and do here.
50,The front desk was very friendly and helpful in making sure I got a casino floor room cause I am very claustrophobic and don’t take elevators. The rooms were clean and nice looking. The only minor details I wasn’t very happy with is that the pillow are too bulky. And the bathroom shower didn’t have a shelf where I can place my shampoo or soap. But other than that everything was great.
50,As soon as we got to Luxor we knew it was going to be a painless experience! We were right! Absolutely everything was as I would have wanted it. Casino restaurants and the transportation were fantastic. EAT at Tender steakhouse while you are there!!! Mark was great!
30,Seems to be more smokey than other casinos. Needs more resteraunts to choose from. Liked that it connected to the Mandalay Bay with shopping stores and eateries. No in door pool. Had to pay daily fee for the use of steam sauna and jacoosie. No lockers in fitness center. Thank you.
40,I am staying in room 10-333 and it is a gorgeous suite (wished it had a microwave)  Well stocked with amenities and the view is amazing.  I guess whom ever made the decision to kick guest out at 3:45pm is VERY TACKY  and Upsetting !!! I couldn’t even finish my food!!!
50,The service was excellent I’ll recommend it to my friends and family and of course when I come back I’ll choose you guys it was an awesome trip and awesome experience I’m very happy thank you for everything
10,We could not sleep at all the night we stayed. You can hear everything happening in the hallways and music playing down stairs. We saw a mouse run from a room to the ice machine. Also the elevators are dangerously under maintained and really sketchy my kids were so scared to ride them because we could feel the elevator slant when we were moving. Control panel broken door hanging on by a thread. The only thing good was the room looked clean
50,It is dark but i thought it added to being in a pyramid. Only knock was no mini fridge in room. The Uber area was easy to get in and out of hotel. Great location to get around to all the other resorts!
40,We decided to stay at the Luxor because we received a really good deal on our nightly rate. We have never stayed there in the past. I was pleasantly surprised at how nice of a place it was. It wasn’t the best casino in town but then again I didn’t spend $300 a night.
50,The room was clean the staff were friendly. The view of the room was great. The only thing that maybe someone would mind is the noise that sometimes is heard as the room was near the elevators but I personally did not mind it
20,As stated before hair on shower wall and bathroom floor dirty. Manager was VERY rude when I asked to have my resort fees waived / removed although the employee the night before waived my fellow travel companions resort fees upon request.
50,Absolutely the best foundational standard room experience on the strip. The Aria rooms are a very relaxing getaway with garden tubs and shower combo vestibules in every room. We never stay anywhere else.
20,We paid for an upgrade but on arrival the room smelled terrible we went back and were assigned our original room.  The day of our event they cut the water right before we were supposed to take a shower luckily it came back on and we made it on time the next day we went to the bathroom and the lights would not come on about 20 minutes later it finally came on. We really wanted to like the place it’s different and unique and I’m sure when it was new and in very good shape it was a great place to be unfortunately I think I choose another place we chose it for Location to be close to some friends staying at a nearby property
50,Especially for the elderly. But a great experience. Please put microwave and refrigerator in the rooms . Rooms was clean bed was comfortable also needs coffee pot very exclusive resort thr architect was beautiful the distance was great you could walk to the strip or catch the bus or Uber
10,The room was very dated dirty with old mattress: Blue Man Group is a shell of what it was and their Buffet (when it's open) is excessively expensive not good value and a bit over the top to suggest a 20%+ tip for a buffet and Tip jars at the crepe & omelet bar.
10,I stayed at the Luxor for two nights and won't return. The hotel room was very grimy and needed a deep clean. The shower wasn't clean I called and asked housekeeping to come clean it they did not come.
20,Room overlooked dining hall area where loud music blared 24/7 so getting a restful night's sleep was impossible. Shower outlet was blocked and ventilation fan in bathroom did not work (we reported those and they were fixed during our stay). Overall hotel feels quite tired (as did we after 4 days of disturbed sleep)....
40,Just returned from Luxor and the resort was a good base to stayas like all other resorts it is massive. Staff are very helpful and most restaurants are good and there is plenty to do. Reason for 4 stars is due to the hotel needing a good spruce upit’s a little out dated but on the good side rooms are quiet and never heard a thing really. Would stay again
10,Just kidding there are 2. But honestly not the best hotel for the value. The electric outlets in the room are so aged that your plugs fall out or partly out causing potential fire hazards. No bath fan or any way to waft away any poop smell. So if you have the trots your whole room gets to sink in the stink... the online check in app does not work and thier front desk moves super slowly. If you get an adjoining room even if your not needing it there is no soundproofing. You can hear your neighbor snoring (hopefully that's the worst of it) all night.
30,Our tower suite was pretty nice maybe a little bit dated but of a large size and elegant. The the major flaw we had at this hotel was housekeeping kept coming into our room when we had to do not disturb sign on and even was trying to get us to check out before I check out time. To view this room and others check out our YouTube channel : Socal Review Plus
40,Weekend getaway Luxor is always a good hotel to stay at. Rooms are nice good location not to far from main strip area. Good food choices staff is very friendly we always enjoy our stay when we come here.
10,A used covid test was under our bed sheets. Instead of changing the bedding the housekeeper placed a plastic bag over the test and left the room. No note was left or information given to us that housekeeping refused to change the bedding.
10,There was nothing about the room check-in personal pricing amenities that makes me want to come back. Presentation of my room was so uninviting that we kept ourselves busy until it was time to just go back to sleep.
10,We were not given the room that we had reserved they didnt seem to care. The whole building was gross and falling apart there were clumps of what looked like vacuumed up pieces laying everywhere and we would walk passed it everyday knowing the cleaning people did too and nothing. Elevators were broken down and pieces hanging off of them of the ones that did work. Overall awful would never recommend.
10,The bathrooms were full of mold. The carpets were old and dirty. Housekeeping is lazy they basically made the beds. They didn’t empty the garbage or vacuum when asked to bring extra blanket and towels to the room the attendant was not very nice
50,Excellent service in all areas we experienced great service in all areas and we’ll come back again in near future. Highly recommend Luxor for all they’ve done for us. Close to strip and airport and look forward to visiting this property again
40,I love the fact that the luxor parking is easy and very convenient. Buffet was good as always. Very friendly staff in all departments. I never liked to be approached when walking though the casino and someone is always trying to sell you something but seems like this is fairly normal for all the casinos.
30,"While passing through Las Vegas I stayed at Luxor for one night. As far as pricing goes it's one of the cheaper hotels on the Strip and to sum it up you get what you pay for. I'd say this place is best for people who don't plan on spending much time in their room or at their hotel and worst for people sensitive to cigarette smoke.    The room was pretty standard; mine was in the pyramid so the exterior wall was slanted inwards. On first glance my room appeared to be recently updated. (I looked it up; the update happened in early 2021.) I appreciate that the Luxor has maintained its iconic look & early 90s Vegas vibe but it is not well maintained. Upon a closer glance the updated room had not been well taken care of; it wasn't anything major rather a culmination of many little things. When I exited my room instead of being greeted with the interior of a vibrant bustling casino/hotel I looked out into an atrium of dead space (sort of a ""backstage"" area). It did not encourage exploration of the hotel.    Some specific issues I would warn people about: parking & smoke.    Hotel parking is located in a surprisingly small disconnected garage behind the hotel. It's quite a trek to get to the lobby and while it doesn't take terribly long to get indoors the disconnectedness become an issue when you're lugging bags in the 115 degree heat.    Then there is the smokiness. If you haven't been to Vegas before most of the casinos allow smoking which means other areas of the hotel can also smell smoky. Some hotels are better than others at filtering the smoke out or ensuring that the rooms and non-smoking spaces don't reek of smoke. Luxor is not one of these hotels. The shape of the pyramid traps the smoke wafting up from the casino. Inside my room there was a light smell of cigarette smoke outside my room it was smoky enough to irritate my sinuses. If you are sensitive to cigarette smoke there are definitely better hotel options for you.    Overall it's not a bad hotel but it really needs some TLC."
50,My experience was excellent from the minute I got to the hotel. Arrived early and my luggage was stored by friendly people. Check-in was easy and fast. The room was clean and well maintained. I definitely will stay there again.
50,The luxor is a great place to stay! You can easily walk indoors through casino's and shops to the Mandalay Bay on one side and in the other to Excalibur and then to NYNY and MGM Grand. Lots of slots and restaurants. Very convenient and great atmosphere! All staff were helpful and very nice!
50,We love staying at the Luxor. This has been my favorite LV hotel since 2011. Good dining options. Helpful staff. Good gaming options. Renovated pyramid rooms. Blue Man group is a must-see (get the poncho seats). Be sure to enjoy Diablo's Cantina (shrimp enchiladas and Baja fish tacos). Kick back with a cold brew and some loaded fries and pepperoni rolls at Public House. Sleep in while your wife hits the spa. Enjoy your stay at The Luxor we always do.
10,The hotel staff had written down the wrong room number so we couldn't open the door with our room card. Some people opened the door and questioned us but the front desk staff didn't think it was their fault tell us it's just a wrong number not their fault.
40,Great stay will likely return. Room was clean and comfortable. Some noise in hallways from inconsiderate people. Enjoy Blue Man Group show. Tram was great as well. Enjoyed amenities at Mandalay as well.
30,I paid for valet parking and when it was time to get my car it was always a long wait. I was not told I has to pay for valet parking. Came in under a promotion. I was never told I would be paying for resort fees aline with 26 a night for parking.
40,Elevators were very slow. The location of the elevator bays were also very confusing. The staff is very very friendly and informative. They helped me with all my requests and answered all of my questions.
20,Our room was clean but the ceiling in the bathroom was falling down and the armchair had stuffing coming out of the ripped arm. Signage is poor. We had to ask for directions twice to find our room. Hallways are poorly lit. The elevators require you to use your phone to operate. We didn’t know that until we were on it. It would be helpful to post the instructions outside the elevator so you know what to do once you get in it. As we are fumbling for our phone and to open the app the lights start to dim in the elevator. Not a welcoming situation. Do not prepay for parking. And prepare to walk - the self park is a long walk to the hotel.
40,The rooms were pretty decent for the price we paid. It was easy to find everything that we needed. It was clean and really easy to check in and out. We had a late flight leaving and the bell service made it nice so that we didn’t have to keep our bags with us.
40,Couldn’t beat the location nearby to everything. Connected to Mandalay Bay where our Event was being held. Heard the rumors about the hotel before we went but surprisingly wasn’t that eerie. Felt fine and safe staying here. No fridge sucked bc all my homemade baby food I brought went bad. Sink didn’t drain. Hookers in lobby tried to solicit my husband. Other than that no issues.
10,My room was broken into my laptop jewelry and a Latin Grammy ticket were stolen. The response of the hotel security was initially horrible they were unsympathetic and did not seem to care. I had to go through 3 managers to eventually get me to a supervisor from security that said they would investigate. They refused to give me any information and the story of who accessed my room changed from one managers account to the other.    They eventually as a gesture refunded me the room but that does not resolve the theft of my computer that has all my work and is livelihood.    I know researched more information about the hotel and it is sad to see that my experience is similar to those of many people. Knowing that these things are happening in their establishment better measurements and security should be taken.    I will never stay there again and I will let anyone know. One should feel safe and not deal with these type of situations.    Horrible experience.
50,Nice resort with a good casino nice & clean rooms several restaurants and a food court.  The Public House restaurant within the hotel has a really good chicken Caesar salad. The hotel also has a free tram that goes to Mandalay Bay And Excalibur. The pool area is beautiful . We loved this hotel and will definitely stay there again!! Also the MGM rewards program is awesome!! Make sure to sign up for it.
40,I wasn't impressed the room didint have a coffee maker or frig halls were dark. the walk to the parking was long. the service was good and the restaurants were good i am not sure if i will be returning
50,I enjoyed this place. It’s my second time in row staying here. It’s has different budget food options. Clean and friendly staff. Valet parking is expensive. Five minutes away from the center of the strip.
50,Very kind staff. The hotel room was clean and got cleaned daily. Spacious room with nice blackout curtains. Great food options and quick services. Will come again and will recommend to others as well.
20,No hot water in the shower. Water would cut out mid shower and take a few minutes to resume. lack of maintenance was told a few times some one would come. Had to constantly remind staff. no resolution even upon maintenance finding an issue we were only offered a food ticket. The tv and bed in the room were old and out dated. The springs on the bed were evident and tried to be hidden with a thick Matt. The tv had jumpy lines through the picture and when renting a movie there was no way to pause or resume.
50,My second Vegas trip and first time at Luxor. Overall I'm happy with the experience. Facilities and staff are good. There was some ware and signs of aging in the room I stayed in. I liked the Egyptian decor.
20,When we arrived we found out we were in the West tower through trial and error as we had to do mobile check in due to the late hour. No where on our reservation did it tell us this and we found out we were actually not in the pyramid but a side building which was disappointing. Additionally the room was dark and there weren’t enough pillows or towels. I’d recommend staying elsewhere.
30,Great location fun staff and friendly atmosphere. Food/restaurants all good. I’d suggest staying in Towers v Pyramid. We had a suite for gathering but a steam shower was out and for the cost the TV should allow everything sports. Stay in Tower.
50,This was my first time in Vegas and I able to get a comp room at MGM's Luxor. I couldn't believe how BIG the hotel was nor how cool the room was. My friend and I had one of the older rooms but it was really nice. The only downside was that the outlets were on the other side of the room and MGM could give more bottles of water.
30,Like ibsaid I was unhappy with the how long it took my room to be ready. I was upset with the smell of my room in my first sweet. They made up for it for the most part but it should have taken as long as it did.
20,Over this last weekend we stayed in a suite with a hot tub in it we were unable to get warm or hot water throughout the room the entire 4 days and were only lightly compensated for such. As a major feature and selling point of the room this was very disappointing for my girlfriend and myself.
40,I didn't have very high expectations for this property but I was pleasantly surprised at how nice it was. We stayed in one of the tower rooms and it was very clean and updated. Everyone here was very friendly. This was my daughter's first trip to Vegas and I am very pleased with our choice of hotels.
10,The TV and the Wifi didn’t work probably. It seems to be a systemic issue at the Luxor according to staff feedback. I missed two important Zoom calls. You would think in 2022 at a high revenue hotel this wouldn’t be an issue! The lack of empathy and concern of the hotel manager was concerning
20,The hotel told us that they were aware of the issue and that we would have water shortly. We didn't get hot water for a least the next 4 hours. Just looking around the hotel it showed numerous area that were run down. Ceiling leaking water with buckets collecting water. The elevator system was an inconvenience as well. We had 12 people in our party with 7 rooms throughout the hotel. We cod visit room to room without someone escorting from that floor. It was a Hugh inconvenience. We have used that hotel for the last 5 years for our annual military gathering for Big Smoke Las Vegas we are going to find a new hotel next year.
20,Water leaked from the ceiling onto the hallway carpet for the entire 5 nights we stayed. No effort was made to dry the carpet and the entire 16th floor stank. Water flooded my son's room supposedly from a misuse of the plumbing on a higher floor.... whatever!!    The staff I had contact were friendly enough. The food on site was very average and pricy. But hey its Vegas I suppose that is what we are suppose to expect. There was no evident effort to be excellent!!!
40,Nice architectural Pyramid. Calm and pleasant atmosphere at the casino floor. Rooms in West Tower are more updated.  Cleanliness could be improved inside room and at slots machines. Lack of drink services.
10,The two rooms we were given were not clean at all. The people that stayed there before us left their beer and garbage in the room. The next room the cleaning people left their rags and the shower leaked all night long.
50,The Luxor is totally underrated the staff was friendly kind and helpful. The hotel was clean and easy to navigate between other hotels with out going outside. Best of all it was a cash saver between the best happy hour options I’ve seen to the lowest table minimums! Don’t miss out on the awesome themed Luxor!
30,Nothing to rave about. Clean room but no refrigerator or microwave and the toilet was not attached to the floor. No room service after 1:45 pm. Loud music from adjacent room starting at 8:30 am. Very hard to get to your floor as elevator was difficult to use with phone key app.
50,The LUXOR is a Great Place to stay in Vegas. Situated between the Excaliber and Mandalay Bay gives you several choices for your gambling or show stopping events using their Tram to get back and forth without having to use local transportation. The party never stops with so many choices.
20,Dirty linend was left at the front door one dirty towel on the bathroom floor few small hairs on the bed i called housekeeping and no one came i went downstairs they said someonr will go in our room but no one came!
20,We showed up there and the pools were nasty. Smelt like hobo urine outside. Hotel was pretty dark. vibe was more for older crowd. No fridge in room. $20 a night if you want it. To get room service was difficult no service. I had to call the front desk to get food. The staff was friendly though.
40,The value was very good (not sure why all the hotels can't be upfront and include additional hotel 'service charges' in their base price). Luxor remains one of our favorite hotel/casinos but it seems to be smokier every time we are there.
40,We had a great stay at the Luxor Hotel. We came to Vegas for a concert. The location is great if you are willing to walk to the other hotels which we don't mind. During November the weather is very enjoyable so walking wasn't an issue. It took about thirty minutes to walk to Planet Hollywood and about forty five minutes to walk to Caesars. I was surprised at how clean and well kept the Luxor was for an older property on the strip. It was very enjoyable and the prices were excellent.
30,The room was really nice with a nice view. But it just felt dirty because we found a vape pen near the bed hair in the towels and the sink clogged half of our trip and nobody came to fix it the first time we asked for almost three hours. And on our last day when we asked for it to be fixed nobody came at all. The room looked nice and the hotel was nice but just staying in the room it just felt dirty. I would go back to visit the casino attractions and food. But staying there again I’m not so sure. Especially since we got a suite and if the suite was like that I’m not sure what an average room would be.
50,10 out of 10! Beautiful… clean and great entertainment. The Luxor casino had the best music every night we were there. My entire group stayed there and they were able to accommodate us all fairly close.
20,A less expensive option if you want to stay on the strip. The Hotel is Not well kept up. Felt dumpy. Location though made it easy to get to other casinos and such. So paying just to have a room to sleep but planning on spending time elsewhere then this place works.
50,Not much of a gambler and this was the first time staying at the Luxor. Overall casino was very nice but most impressed by the comfort of the bed. Had the best nights rest so have to give Luxor a 10 in comfort.
10,After 20 years my stays at Luxor have come to an end. The elevators were brokendents in all the doors wires hanging outfuse box not covered. No hot watersafe or refride. Dirty. Do I need to go on?
10,Stayed for 5 nights and quickly discovered how outdated this hotel is. Check in took 30mins due to long lines. We had to use Elevator #2 where only 2 of 4 elevators were in service. Whether you were going up or down the elevator would always stop on floors 8 or 9 for no reason at all. The doors would the. Take a minute to close just after making a long beeping noise. The elevator was an issue during check in and check out times and we found ourselves in line just to use the elevator. The stairs are for Emergency Exit only. The room was outdated. Our room was on the 15th floor and you could see a lot of trash that ppl throw onto the structures that are in the middle of the pyramid. I did like how close the hotel is to Allegiant Stadium.
10,1 hour plus check in time oversold room gone 2 hours to get Siler room 2 more hours to get rollaway.    Next day switch to bigger room...urine odor through rugs...horrible disgusting    Staff was ambivalent to our issues..housekeeping did try...
40,Good overall value. It's a nice hotel but not anything special. The room rates are a lot cheaper than most other hotels on the strip. It is very clean. The price of food in the food court is high for it being fast food. The hotel is a bit confusing to get around.
20,i left my review in the first section but the cleanliness was a negative . my son made comments each and every time we walked down the hall. there was dust as far as the eye could see and basically garbage on all the visable spots on the other side of the balcomys to our room
50,Great view from door of 6th floor and the sunrise in morning from the room. Elevator or inclination was a unique experience. Glad I wasn’t drinking because of the sideways movement. Casino is huge and cafe was very good
10,Luxor charged me $500USD saying I damaged the room by leaving the tap on. This is completely untrue as I am not a child and would not leave a tap on.    It would take a massive amount of water to flood  House keeping was in the room 45 minutes after we checked out making it impossible to flood  Sinks have overflows for this very reason  If the sink did flood this is due to plumbing issues nothing to do with me.    Our tv didn’t work we didn’t have house keeping and the noise levels were excessive so we checked out a day early and were told we would receive the resort fees back this didn’t happen. Instead they charged me a false charge and refuse to send me proof or discuss. When I spoke to the manager I was told to fight the charge with the credit card company. This is a unacceptable response.    I have sent several emails about the issue with no response.    Do NOT book here.
50,Very pleased with the outstanding customer service we received at the beautiful Luxor Hotel and Casino. Convenient location reasonable guest room prices and room cleanliness were excellent. Looking forward to next time! ❤️~SS~
50,The Luxor was a great venue with friendly staff in close proximity to lots of amenities for both college and professional football games experiences. Sportsbook staff were helpful. We took advantage of MGM Rewards program to earn discounts while shopping and dining. We’ll definitely stay here again.
40,Mobile check was a breeze bell hops was super friendly and super fast. There is always someone one the floors to help you. Beautiful spa and again the staff was beyond great. Wish they had coffee makers in the rooms no In room dining.
40,We had a great time at Luxor. Every employee that we interacted with was very nice to us The Sportsbook staff was friendly and helpful. I'm still not a fan of the Timeshare salespeople combing the place and interrupting your peaceful walk through the casino. I guess the casinos get enough compensation from these companies to make it worth the inconvenience to it's hotel guests. The room was great and very quiet. The cleaning staff was super nice and asked if we needed anything. The location is perfect to get to many other great casinos. I would stay at the Luxor again and be happy.
40,Food at TENDER steakhouse was the best steak this Texan has eaten (and my Grandaddy owned a steak restaurant in Dallas so I am picky about my beef)! The Titanic exhibit is a must see and The Blue Man Group was so entertaining and fun. Great shops friendly staff and very comfy beds! The only reason I didn’t give it 5 stars is because the hotel is showing its age in a lot of places especially the elevators! But for the price and closeness to everything you get a good deal there.
10,Just bad place to stay. Brought my mother 3 year old baby and wife to somewhere I felt bad bringing them too after. There was water leaks no hot water stains on towels and just total unsatisfactory
30,Wanted to check out the Luxor. Have stayed at numerous other MGM and Caesars properties in Las Vegas. Stayed here because of the short walk to Allegiant Stadium to take -in and Raider game and a Fresno State v UNLV game. Carlos Santana @ House of Blues too. Good location for stadium access. Great show selection (Blue Man Carrot Top Bodies Exhibit Titanic King Tut Mandalay Sharks). Just average. Maybe a solid 3 overall.
30,It was everything you would expect from a Las Vegas hotel. Since this was a first time visit we had a lot of difficulty finding our room due to poor signage. I have stayed at many Las Vegas hotels but this was not good. I even asked the staff for help but all they could do was point fingers in the correct direction.
40,I found the Luxor to be a tremendous value when compared to the other hotel and casinos. The location and proximity to two other properties was one of my favorite characteristics. Great for big groups with varied budgets.
30,We have preferred the Luxor for the last 20 years occasionally staying at other MGM properties like the Bellagio. The rooms haven't aged well and little inconveniences like non-working elevators just dragged down the experience. The staff was still amazing and the table games and slots were a lot of fun.  It would be great if other visitors bothered to observe that smoking marijuana in public or in casino rooms is still not allowed! I don't care if you smoke it or if your clothes stink; I do care if my room stinks because you smoke next door.
10,We made reservations months in advance to celebrate my wife’s birthday only to get to front desk which took at least an hour to get through only to find out the hotel had overbooked and given away our room which we had reservations for. To be fair our receptionist Donna did her very best to make it right but sadly our experience was not a pleasant one.
20,Poor quality outdated over charged for everything. There was a sprinkler which looked like I was just stuck in the wall. Having to pay 30$ for parking is insane after gambling several hundred dollars. Also the lady at front desk gave us false information on the cost of parking saying it was 15$
50,Had a great time and enjoyed a clean room and easy checkin and check out process. The staff were friendly and the house keeping ensured the rooms had all we needed. I also enjoyed the food options inside the hotel and the decor. Definitely recommend the tower rooms they are spacious and upgraded.
30,Had a room problem that the Luxor staff tried to remedy but never got solved during our stay. we enjoyed the casino and location but the room and overall cleanliness will make us look at other MGM properties. I dont think we will stay here again.
50,It was a great stay. I just wish there was fridge and microwave. The rooms were beautiful and great sights. I would definitely stay here again on a business trip. This was exciting and a great experience..
20,I used my MGM points to receive a discounted room here. Our second morning there we were woken up by the loud sounds of power tools going into the wall from the room above. This went on for a couple of hours starting before 9am. I tried calling the front desk to see what was going on and was on hold for 30 minutes before giving up due to my already growing frustrations. I’m not sure why we weren’t notified of the renovations being made so close to us nor if we had been given that room due to me getting a discounted rate. I will more than likely not stay at the Luxor again.
20,I feel I got my money’s worth but overall not a top notch place. The water getting turned off for a few hours Saturday afternoon was a big ordeal….it was my wedding day and made getting ready difficult
30,I stayed here in 2004 and again last week. The Luxor opened in 1994 and now has 30 years of wear and tear. The room was clean comfortable and as expected. No tubs showers only (the water was hot and good shower pressure). The property is massive there are 4400 rooms. The carpets are tired. The facility isn't fresh and you can detect the odor of cigarettes' upon entry into the casino. What I noted while waiting inline to check in and check out (the in room menu feature allowing self-check out in the room wasn't working) was that a number of people were in line to complain either about issues with their reservation or room. The hotel is a good value. I paid about the same to stay at Motel six in Twin Falls ID as I did to stay at the Luxor and it a lot nicer than motel 6. It is is massive It takes a while to settle in and a while to check out. You get what you pay for and for what I paid it is good value. It is a three star experience in what was once a 4 star hotel.
50,Overall had an amazing experience. We love that it is the hotel an casino and nice restaurant in the same place. Room was clean. Only down fall was that the room did not have a mini fridge. Another bad things is that lady who was bringing drinks was kind of rude when we didn’t have change for the tip.
30,The hotel room and casino were fine. The MGM app made everything so easy to check in and out. The only problem was going to the room. The elevators suck! Waited 10+ minutes to go up to the room and had to wait the same amount to go down. We waited even longer after the football game ended(Sunday). Would I stay here again? Probably not but would definitely stay at another MGM hotel.
40,This was a great hotel for the price we paid for night. The hotel room was very clean and the bed was super comfortable. This hotel due to the shape and set up is a bit loud where you can hear a lot on the hotel floors.
10,The construction was going so early and no one said anything about construction going on needles to say there was no damn hot water never stay in the 1st floor! I couldn’t even sleep! And I was there to rest
30,Room was okay but shower was corroded and water was off in the middle night. TV did not work most of the time. Wallpaper was ripped and falling off the wall 9th floor east. Transients sleeping in the elevators and the lobby.
50,We had a blast! The pyramid was super fun with elevators that go up on a 39 degree angle. Friendly efficient staff and central location between Mandalay Bay and Excalibur with the nice tram. The King Tut Tomb experience was great and we learned a great deal.
10,I am not just going to complain but advise to stay elsewhere  Staff rude  Fire alarms  Cold showers  Terrible WI-FI which you pay for    I have stayed at almost every hotel on the strip . This is just 1 step up from circus circus . Stay at Excalibur over Luxor at the least .
50,I stayed at the Luxor when attending a Raider game at Allegiant stadium and had a great time! The hotel is located in walking distance to the game the room was clean and comfortable and using the MGM resorts app to check in & out was very convenient. I also liked the digital room keys my son was arriving before me I was able to check in and send him a digital room key so he could go to the room before I arrived.
10,Horrible! Charged twice and didn’t want to help me !!!! I was explaining that I had paid ! Rude ! Both manager and staff!!!! Unprofessional! I had to wait an hour because they charged me two times then reversed the charge! To top it off they didn’t want to waive the resort fee ! Arrived at midnight and took them over an hour to check me in due to their error !!!
20,Saturday at around Midnight I was woken up from what sounded like a fire alarm going off throughout the room hotel and casino. I hurried up rushed to get my clothes on went down to the Casino floor to see nobody even cared. People were still gambling at slot machine and tables. There was no staff to even explain what was going on if we had to evacuate or if it was a false alarm. After about ten minutes it turned off. I went back up to my room just for it to go off again. Completely ruining my chance of getting a good night rest.
50,The Luxor has been upgraded… I enjoyed our two bedroom suite… Two full bathrooms and a half bath for guests… Living room dining room four different air conditioner units to control everything… room service great.
10,Hi i would highly advise against staying at this hotel. The check in is horrible the rooms are dirty the food is disgusting the layout is pathetic. I am shocked at how out of touch the service and experience is at this hotel. Travel lodge smokes this place.
10,Run down poorly maintained hotel. The water was shut off to the hotel for extended periods. Bathrooms were moldy and little black mold specks continuously came out of the spout. Not worth the money. Worst hotel we ever stayed at in Las vegas.
50,I have no complaints the room was great n the food was great service was awesome fast with the drinks when gambling great music in the center bar great bartender friendly and fast easy check in as well i would recommend and will to my friends and family to stay at the luxor
40,"We always love staying at the Luxor. We visit Vegas every year and always stay here. Yes it's a tad outdated but we like it. Always clean great tables and slots. It's at the end of the strip but easy to walk to everything. It is connected to both Mandalay Bay and Excalibur so getting to either of them is a breeze. Between Luxor and Mandalay Bay is their ""mall"" with a handful of stores and restaurants. If you stay at Luxor Public House is really yummy and have everything! Plus there aren't a ton of kids that stay at the Luxor which is a plus!    Pros  -Cheap  -Great tables and slots  -Clean  -Multiple pools  -Great buffer between Mandalay Bay and Excalibur    Cons  -A tad outdated but always clean  -Sometimes the moving sidewalks that lead to the strip are broken down"
20,The room did not come with a closet no options to make coffee/tea no extra linen. no refrigerator. Not even a courtesy bottle of water was provided. The hotel rooms are outdated although the skyline view was nice. The hotel lost hot water and failed to inform us of this issue. The hotel imposes a mandatory resort fee to include internet access then it charges you to use the computer other than to print a boarding pass. The beds were average. We received housekeeping services but the bathroom linen is old and worn. Given the appearance of the hotel from the outside and the amount of money the casino brings in and what is charged for food I expected better.
50,Wow place is awesome from the minute you arrive pull into valet check in is easy and off u go th gaming entertainment great food at the    Stadium restaurant close to airport Bali Hi golf course the Las Vegas sign and there is a Starbucks coffee house there
50,Loved the stay! Easy checking in and out. The location is great for nearby attractions most places are in walking distance or you can Uber/Lyft. All the staff workers were very friendly and respectful!!
10,H Horrible room unclean. The bed spread was dirty there were “substance” smears on the dresser top black stains in the bathtub the iron was even broken orrible room unclean. The bed spread was dirty there were “substance” smears on the dresser top black stains in the bathtub the floor right outside the room was flooded there was air in the lines which splashed all over our face and the iron was even broken
40,Still have fun at this hotel. I like the theme of Luxor. It has great exhibits in Titanic and Body's. The problems I have with the hotel are: mold in ceiling of bathroom hair in toilet and bathroom floor hotel needs a face-lift. I would stay again but I wish they would spend some money on maintenance.
10,My rooms were very dirty also smelled like smoke. We had to change rooms three times in until we gave up. It was too short notice to find another hotel room. We hardly seen any staff other than the employees who were really pushy for us to buy a timeshare
40,It's good to stay at the same place where you're going to watch several of the shows offered on site. Luxor is so huge that it was a bit overwhelming and my friend and I (both of whom are senior citizens) got confused at times; however we always managed to find a staff person to help us.
20,Old and not up to standards of other nearby resorts like Mandalay Bay. Poor layout not many bars. Overall impression is very downscale. Fighting and yelling in the hallways woke us up both nights. Do not recommend.
30,I had initially paid for early check in which would allow check in at 11am I attempted to even speed the process by checking in on the mobile app. Neither of those things mattered. My room wasn’t ready until after 3pm. During my stay the staff didn’t interact with me much and couldn’t seem to be bothered with anything outside of talking to each other. Check out is where this continued on this….path. I attempted late checkout in the app but experienced some technical difficulties with the app. I tried calling in but initially had to disconnect to meet a deadline for a show. I attempted to call the front desk to get some help and was met with the opposite. I was told that it wasn’t her problem and that she needed her rooms for other guests. I get it that may have been the case but at no point did this individual attempt any tact in addressing my concern. Instead I decided to try to pack up and be out for the normal check out time. I unfortunately had forgotten an important envelope with show tickets and some photos from my trip. Thankfully the first time I did receive help was to get a temporary key to get my stuff back to my dismay the housekeeper had already thrown it away in her trash bin and I had to fish it out.
30,The hotel certainly has the wow factor with its mega huge lobby decoration casino and of course the pyramid shape. Sadly the rooms seem dated and in need of a fresher style. We were travelling around USA and it was the only hotel room out of 6 that did not offer a coffee machine or a small fridge (a fridge was available at extra cost). The decor was dark and aged with a nasty carpet. Beds were comfortable and the room was huge. New bathroom and decor is all that is needed to bring it up to date.
10,Paid for parking that we couldn't use at the Luxor because the self-parking lot was closed on two different times on two different days. No coffee pot no alarm clock no refrigerator burned out bulb in the room when you turned on the reading light a very loud humming noise was coming from one of the lights no tub very dusty on all surfaces - took pictures if you want to see. Poor communication for hotel guest you have to dig around to find any information about what services are available to guests I found that a little difficult. We have a small 7 pound service dog (with proper documentation and active registration) told by front desk since we booked online we still needed to pay the pet room fee because any changes need to be done 72 hours in advice.
30,This is a decent hotel to stay at. Nothing really makes it stand out from the other large casinos on the strip and nothing is free. Not even the exhibits so you don’t really benefit from the Egyptian theme. Room was clean.
30,"I have been coming to the""Luxor ""in Vegas for over 20 year. I stayed in the pyramid for the first time in a long time in a renovated room for a tradeshow a few days ago. I was a little disappointed for a room that had just been redone. There was nothing special or fancy or any of the ""wow"" factor that usually comes when you walk into a new redecorate room. Five years. I was on the 25th floor in room 139 between November 8 through the 11th. There was a big rain storm prior to me arriving and in the hallway on the 25th floor there a dehumidifiers it look like it roof was leaking from the rain. I am returning to the Luxor in February 2023 for another industry conference and I hope my experience is a lot better than this last"
40,We had a great stay at the Luxor. Location was great the rooms are comfortable and clean. We loved the hotel theme and decor. The thing that would've made it better would've been a coffee maker and a refrigerator in the room.
20,Was not satisfied and I will not be returning to this hotel. For the price of the room it should've included a mini refrigerator at least. They don't even give you enough body towels. The linen looked as if it wasn't changed
50,Luxor Hotel & Casino is a beautiful place to stay at or visit with XCaliber hotel right across(beautiful as well)! Good food bars slots some entertainment & views. also people are just great and fun from staff there to meeting and socializing! Must see especially if you like Pyramids!
10,This hotel sucks. Period. What a mess. The casino definitely could use an update but don’t let it’s only mediocre appearance fool you into thinking mediocre rooms. They are atrocious. Dirty. Really dated. Furniture mirrors chipped and scuffed up. Television with a horrible image serios horizontal banding that you wouldn’t see in the most low budget motel. The elevators are downright dangerous with entire panels missing or loose. The whole thing screams we are not investing a penny into our hotel when it crumbles down we’ll start from scratch. Truly embarrassed to my family that I messed up this bad booking the place. Never again. Spend another 50 a night and stay at any other strip hotel casino trust me.
40,I would recommend as long as there are no “water or phone issues.” — My husband & I loved the resort & everything it offered (views shows etc.). Upsetting the morning we left. Woke up at 5am to go to the airport & we had no water. Tried to call the front desk but the phone didn’t work.
50,Excellent Geat Awesome resort!!! Will definitely return!! First time at this resort was celebrating my birthday and anniversary!! Buffet could be better needs better tasting food but decor and statues are awesome!!
30,Fun but spooky!!! The elevator’s lights were out and they was missing cameras. It needs ventilation at the top of the pyramid thus the smell. Great architecture but little cosmetic issues here and there.
40,We love the location this trip was about walking every inch. We stayed at this end. Our suite was nothing but excellent! Lost a handful of thousands and some and no waitress near by to quench my thirst while loosing but overall we’ll be staying here again!
10,So noisy beds very uncomfortable. Mobile check in & out didn't work. Complaint about bothersome guests ignored. No basic amenities like room fridge or clothes hangers provided. Bed-making method means you have to tear the bed apart and remake it in order to sleep in it
50,We had an amazing time in a very magical place. The staff is wonderful. Every meal we had was great and the gaming is as fair as you can find. I don’t know if you can find a better experience on the strip.
10,Late check out policy changed upon me leaving the property I was told two times by somebody on the phone that I would be able to do a late check out was not a problem my flight left at 10 PM so I was forced to book another ride at the hotel and I didn’t stay there
10,The Luxor was very bad to park in. Also it was too loud during the night. I could hear everything. The service was terrible. The AC was turned off so we could not use it throughout our stay and the heater kept turning on. The walk from the garage to our rooms was way too long. Checking out was very confusing to the point that it caused anxieties. Would not recommend staying there
40,Its definitely in need of a refresh as both the hotel and the room were very tired looking and the room looked dated. Having said that the room was clean and the view we had was great. We asked for a high floor which the staff were happy to sort and it was lovely and quiet. Really enjoyed the location of this hotel and lots of transportation and walkways to make it accessible. The pool was the main downfall. Most was closed off so very crowded.
50,the resort looks great from the outside the interior has many signs of wear and tear. I gave the luxor a high rating for several reasons...it is close to the alligiant stadium the staff are friendly and engaging. and our rooms were very clean.
50,The Shower was very clean and the Water pressure was amazing. The BlueMan Group was great. The Diablo Cantina is was delicious.  We did not get to try the Public House or the Buffet as they were closed the day and time we were there.
50,Room was nice size bed was soft bathroom was clean. No microwave or refrigerator in the room that we had but we were okay with that. They was plenty to explore in the hotel. A lot of cool statues and how the elevator goes at a angle.
50,Just had the best weekend ever there with my wife! The Tender food and staff were off the scale!! Craps tables get hot quick! Was turned around when I arrived and hotel staff helped me find my way with a smile!
20,I booked two rooms. One of the rooms had some lights out and both rooms had wet carpet when we got there. The ice machine by our rooms didn't work. The 2b elevators had all kinds of problems so sometimes we waited for 30+ minutes to get on an elevator
50,The room were clean and affordable and secure. Needed a room key to enter room floors in the pyramid. Housekeeping was accommodating to requests. Beds and pillows were comfortable and I’m a side sleeper. Bathrooms had exhaust fans which I love!! Tram easy to access to Excalibur and walkway to New York New York
50,I'm definitely satisfied with my stay at the Luxor! I'm coming back again to stay because its sooooo much to do in the Luxor especially with the restaurants & the quality of the casino is great! Happy.
40,Got a king corner suite (with a hot tub next to the bed). Spacious. Romantic. Great view. Could have better ventilation being the tub created alot of humidity. But really nice. Friendly staff. Overall pleased.
20,Appears old and tired. Example bar chairs at the central bar which should be a premier location we’e torn and ripped. Housekeeping came way early and then never checked back. Last time booking this location.
20,There was a leak in the hallway blower fan noise all day and night dirty smelly towels I had to step over to get to my room when I call bell desk and concierge both were rude to me and never sent anyone to clean it up.
30,The room was clean and a very nice size but it comes with no refrigerator microwave coffee pot not even a clock. The distance from the elevators to the room and to the parking garage are very far. A lot of the restaurants were closed during the week and theybcharge for parking even for their hotel guest.
30,This hotel was a good value and convenient to the airport. Easy access to Mandalay Bay which is where our convention was. The Casino was a bit smoky. The room was comfortable but a bit tired - it also was not spotless when we checked in. Not bad enough to stop me from staying in the future.
30,Nothing special. No fridge parking is very far. When I checked in I walked in on someone else’s room. They fixed it and I got a new room. It’s just very far from parking lot. Everything is just satisfactory. Nothing special or extra. Hallways were dirty alot. Beds weren’t comfortable. Pretty hard and can feel the springs. It’s not a terrible place just not that great.
30,Luxor is an average Hotel. We did have to move rooms twice because of no air-conditioning. It was an easy process and they comped us $50 each time we moved. The hotel was not full so maybe it was easy to move us in another room but it was not a bad process. We arrived at 10am and they held our luggage & went straight to the pool. Again probably luck but our room was available by 12:30.  They had indoor walking to both Mandalay Bay and the Excalibur! And a walkway to NYNY. Ate at the buffet at Luxor Excalibur & MGM. MGM was the most expensive and I did not think they offered any better options than at the other 2 buffets. We would get up by 7am - drink & gamble while there were less people in the casino eat about noon - head to the pool - then shower up for a late night show.  Tip: lots of wait staff will give you 2 drinks at a time if you ask! I gave a $1 tip every time.  Pool was ok - nothing great but not bad either. They still had 2 pools not open but there was enough room for all.
30,I was really excited to stay at one of the iconic strip hotels. The access to exhibits and shows was nice and the spa was nice. The casino isn't anything special for the strip and the rooms were what really let my score down. Kind of dingy and bare bones as far as amenities. Might be better to stay here in the summer because I think there is some shared access to Mandalay Bay pools?
10,There are much better places to stay in Vegas. Found out for yourself. My experience was not the greatest. I stayed there for 5 nights and they put me in a room with a huge beam in front of the window. No view at all. It’s the little things that matter.
40,Not the best but by far not the worst. The room was less than expected for a tower king suite. Be sure to request a high floor if you want a view of anything other than a roof. Some dealers are extremely rude and one was visibly sick but still permitted to work and interact with players. Overall I was less than impressed with this property in comparison to others I have stayed at in Vegas.
10,Low quality experience for being part of a large international conference. Walking to the East Tower made me feel like I was going to a sketchy part of town. Staff were courteous and helpful. No nearby bars or restaurants.
50,This place was nothing short of fabulous from the elegant room to the friendly staff. All areas of the facility was spotless and I would recommend this place to everyone. I will definitely be back to the Luxor
40,Enjoyable stay rooms clean staff nice. conveniently located between casinos to earn rewards. The only drawback is no fridge in room. Front desk was very accommodating to getting me and friends on the same floor when checking in.
50,It was a convenient stay at lixor. Nice and clean rooms. Impressive ambience.  Iys worth coming back and staying at luxor. 1 drawaback of rooms was No fridge- no coffee machine. In case you ate travelling with kids get an upgraded room with these appliances.
10,My stay was horrible I wouldn’t recommend this hotel due to no hot water the sink was clogged. The toilet did flush properly. The only good thing was the bed and pillows. The room had a smell and no refrigerator
40,Maria / Mari was super friendly and apologized when room was NOT ready when I arrived.    however when i went back to get the room key a few hours later the other lady and shift manager Lyanne was rude. I was promised a call back and never received it. had to wait in the same line twice and several hours later to get my room.... my room was a higher priced 2 bedroom suite which should get me much better service than this crap.
10,Stayed here for the first time and was very excited only to be sorely disappointed when I realized that our room had not been properly cleaned. We arrived to find glitter on the floor and desk long brown hairs all over the bathroom floor and a fake press on mail by one of the beds. When I called the front desk asking if our sheets had even been changed their response was “Can you check?” Absolutely terrible. Will never be returning.
50,Great atmosphere friendly staff clean rooms. Great price for the quality. Easy efficient check-in. Close to Hershey store and M&M store. Easy access to the Excalibur. Staff makes you feel like you matter.
10,Avoid avoid avoid! Property is extremely dated filthy and downright scary. Rooms are filthy (dirty linens and furniture dirty bathroom) smelly broken furniture mold in rooms holes in walls toilets don’t work and no closet. I was told no other rooms available. Clientele are scary and racist and openly talk about how we didn’t know English but won’t talk directly to us. Trash all over outside. Our room was one of the “nicer” corner suites. I’d hate to see what an average room was like. If you don’t valet it’s a super walk to get to car park. I had to walk past 80 rooms to get to mine from the elevator. Smokier than other properties on the strip. People smoking pot o outside in walkway to the parking garage. American Express told us to just leave and they’d take care of it. Come to find out that hotel won’t cancel and refund reservation at all because we didn’t let them help us. I’m not sure how they would’ve helped since we were told no other rooms available. Super frustrating.
10,I will never stay at the Luxor again the room substandard if I’m staying somewhere for three and four days and if I can go to a city motel and receive coffee free in the room I feel that staying at the Luxor in Las Vegas should’ve provided at least free coffee instead no coffee no refrigerator no complementary water it was sad and these things were not told to me prior or during my registering!
20,My room smelled had no mini bar or nice size tv with good quality channels. Not sure why it was called a premium room. Curtains dont open easily shower had a big hole on a ceilling above the shower head. There was no bodywash just tiny round soap bars that dont lather well especially on a hairy body. The hotel smelled so bad like cigarette smoke. Its pet friendly but it felt like I had to walk 2 miles to an area where im suppose to walk my dog. Both exterior sides of the pyramid were 70% covered with advertisement which ruined th experience of staying at a pyramid.The whole experience was Meh. Except the price. I suppose you get what you paid for.
40,Last minute last stop of a vacation. This hotel was large and in a great spot. Loved the tram and walkways to neighboring casinos. The room was nice sized and very clean and comfortable. The staff here are top notch. Used online check in in the app and it made getting a room a breeze with no line.
20,Had to wait to take a shower…no hot water. Complained and was fluffed off. Thermostat kept dropping to 60 degrees while we slept. Woke up freezing every night. Complained about the water and was asked if we turned the handle far enough….yes we did and the water still wasn’t warm enough to shower.
30,FYI…no refrigeratorcoffee pot or microwave in the room.our cable wouldn’t work. Was clean though. Good aesthetics for hotel.if you’re going to Vegas on a budget this is an okay option .appeared to be animal and children friendly
10,My first time to Vegas. I believe that the employees could have spoke more. Front desk could have informed us of the rewards. No complementary breakfast/ coffee or tea. Some of the dresser doors were locked and I was there for 3 nights and had to share my room but it was not enough space for clothing or a place to put your shoes. I had to keep asking for towels when I wood housekeeping I will be here for 3 days.
50,Love the Luxor for the price and staff are longtime employees. They are top shelf.    Just stayed 3 nights Nov 2022  And was great. Comfortable and clean rooms.    Easy mobile check in and check out.  They are celebrating 30 years of service this year.
40,We had a double queen room.  Would have liked access to refrigerator. It was locked so in order to use you have to pay.  Furniture was old bedding was good.  Room was clean. We don’t spend much time in room anyway.  Check in was quick. We would go back.
10,No microwaves no fridge no coffee makers parking is far poor security and attention from staff. During the stay our vehicle was broken into. Overall don’t recommend disappointed. Very little to satisfy visitors would’ve at least liked complimentary water bottles in the room or something
50,Great spot to play and stay with plenty of amenities and access to other nearby casinos. Make sure to get that upgrade to the suite when you can to really enjoy the time there and stretch out from a long day.
10,We waited a hour to check in Saturday evening because Luxor’s system is down late nights and they work off one computer. Our tower room was unavailable and we were supposed to be staying for three days. We were moved to another room in the pyramid. We were told we would be moved to the tower the next day. Housekeeping tried to kick us out at 10am the first morning. Then we had to wait at the hotel for several hours waiting for another room in the tower to open up. We had to wait for and pay the bell hop again. It wasted most of the day Saturday. We had to wait in line again to get new keys. Really unbelievable.
50,I had a great experience at the Luxor. I will be back next year. The rooms were very clean. The bathroom was very big and had a shower and a bath tub too. The TV was nice with numerous channels. I enjoyed this stay.
30,Besides the shower having no or low hot water the towels are crusty everything else was great. I would give it a I stay as I have stayed here many times before. The check in process has to be very and with all the sights to check in via mobile fails to tell you the app doesn’t work after midnight
30,Utah issues temporary paper identification when moving to an adult (21+) license. Do not visit Vegas with this ID and expect everyone to accept it. Half of the staff at Luxor accepted it then the other half told us we needed to leave. Would have been great to know that before booking the trip.
20,While the staff was very helpful and friendly it didn't make up for the fact that my pyramid room was noisy the bathroom shower was moldy and there wasn't a clock or a coffee maker in the room. Overall the air was so dry in the building we all have sore throats. This casino hotel is long overdue for renovation.
30,Lukewarm water for shower saggy couch in corner suite no fridge but a great view. The staff cleanliness and the casino and restaurants themselves were excellent. Will probably not stay at Luxor again but will visit the casino.
50,The staff went out of their way to make our visit stress free. Hotel is huge and can be overwhelming but the service we were provided was very personal and thorough. Rooms were clean and spacious although a coffee maker would have been appreciated for morning coffee. An 18 floor journey for morning coffee is a little much while getting ready for your day. That aside I would dry stay again
30,Luxor was a decent hotel and an even better price. The location isn’t directly on the street however within walking distance to all things on the strip. I definitely think the tower rooms are outdated and the rooms did not have refrigerators or microwaves. Overall if your not about fancy amenities I feel this is a great option.
40,Was highly happy with the day who checked me in my room . I’ve missed good service especially in LAs Vegas. . I upgraded to a suite  and was very satisfied with my room the suite met beyond my expectations it was very clean and modern. I enjoyed my stay greatly
40,This resort was fine for a short stay. It was very dark inside the guest rooms and lobby/casino. The food options were fine but the rooms needed some attention to detail (mold on shower ceiling items left inside drawers etc)
10,Our room was broken into. Security never came to check it out. We felt unsafe and decided to check out. Now they refuse to give us our money back. And the staff just hangs up on us when we call. Do NOT stay at the Luxor! Terrible experience and the staff doesn't care.
30,At 10:15pm I contacted the front desk regarding the TV in my room not working they transferred me to engineering who told me that they wouldn’t arrive until 11:15 - 11:30pm I told them that that was unacceptable as I just wanted to watch a little TV and go to sleep. So I asked for a different room so they transferred me back to the front desk. They told me that there were no other rooms available which I know was a lie as the hotel was not that busy. They then said they would send someone ASAP to fix the TV.    I looked at the back of the tv and found that the power cord that was plugged into the wall outlet was unplugged at the back of the TV so I plugged it in and it worked.    I then called the front desk and told them to cancel the engineering person that was coming to fix the TV and the lady I spoke to said she would. AT 12:30am Sunday morning I was woken up by engineering here to fix the TV. Obviously I was not happy when I was woken up after I was told they would cancel the repair request.    That’s why you get a mediocre review.
30,My girlfriend and took our last vacay for the year. We decided Vegas and overall we had a great time. Our stay at the Luxor was a decent experience. Not as much offered at the Luxor as some other hotels we visited while there.
20,We stayed at the Luxor 25 years ago and it was great. This time not so great. They were plenty of affordable rooms but we paid quite a bit more for an upgraded version that had a soaking tub by the window in the pyramid. It was a couples weekend for us no kids the soaking bath seemed amazing. It wasn’t. It hadn’t been cleaned properly since the last use and had a giant smudge on it that made us very uncomfortable and we didn’t use it. We communicated with housekeeping at least four times to no avail. Gambling was fine restaurants were quite nice the beds were very comfortable it just seems that the rooms had not been properly maintained over the years.
10,Customer service was terrible was treated like I was an inconvenience to them. Traveling with 13 people for wedding party and asked to have rooms somewhat close. They made sure to put us all on separate floors. WILL NEVER STAY AGAIN!!
50,Experience was good. Enjoyed our 4 nights stay. Housekeeping was great. Cleaned our rooms every afternoon everyday throughout our stay. They have amazing buffet. We enjoyed it every thing. I will definitely recommend this hotel.
30,I’ve been staying at the Luxor for years. This past trip however is making me want to check other places. Staff was fantastic rooms were a bit dirty when we arrived. Gaming floor Had a bunch of options
30,Room wasn’t very clean check-in process was a joke no help from staff overall I wouldn’t stay here again. Took us 2 hours to find our room and having to go back to the front desk multiple times was ridiculous. Asked for additional towels and washcloths no one ever showed. Totally not worth it for how far away from the main strip they are.
10,I have stayed at the Luxor before and had a nice room and things were pretty good given the discounted price over other properties near the Mandalay Convention Center. This time was different and very disappointing! Bathroom toiletries were non-existent (conditioner shower gel) or dismal (horrible bar soap) I could not get a wine glass to take to my room from housekeeping or any of the bars/restaurants on the property and there were no dinner reservations at any of the restaurants on property for days with room service is entirely unavailable. The only option was to order takeout from the restaurants and what I received was all slopped together in the container and drink served in a plastic cup. Just awful and it cost $50. In addition the guy in the next room was very noisy and when he checked out at 3:30 am on Friday housekeeping showed up 5 minutes later and cleaned his room for 30 minutes making a ton of noise and keeping me awake for a long time. I have never heard of a hotel that had housekeeping come in the middle of the night while other guests were sleeping. So ridiculous!! I had an OK room and it was fairly clean but that's the only good thing I can say. I will never stay at the Luxor again!!
40,The room was very nice. The bathroom floor had not been cleaned though pretty gross. Soda/water vending machine was out of service on our floor - had to go back down to first floor to get something to drink. Not such a big deal but after a long day of a lot of walking/playing it was an annoyance to have to get back out and go down to the first floor to find something to drink. No fridge in the rooms.
10,Well where do I start with the Luxor Las Vegas! On arrival all seemed great it looks great the theme is a little dated but overall first impressions were good. We did the express check in and that was fine although nothing mentioned regarding room tax etc and when questioned this was all sorted which surprised us. We made our way through the casino the noise and smell of smoke was not what I’m used to but again it’s Vegas and this is the norm. The lift which goes sideways and they all seem to think is a engineering marvel was old battered dented and had open electrical boxes and all the way to floor 20 of the pyramid it squeaked and wobbled the whole way and at this point I just thought hmm it’s old and used a lot. Waking around the pyramid I though to myself this is old the doors are dull brown and look grotty. On entering the room the smell of damp and the dated look did not impress and looking at the fixtures and fittings I don’t think there was one surface not damaged or broken. There were 3 pillows on bed nowhere to hang clothing and the place felt dirty the bathroom was not much cleaner than a well used public toilet with limescale and mould on all fixtures and fittings. And then the squeaking started. The lifts can be heard all night going up and down with poorly lubricated wheels echoing around the room add that noise to the excessively loud casino floor music it’s fair to say the first night was awful with a maximum of a hours broken sleep being had. The next morning we went to complain regarding the noise the mould etc and to be fair the woman working that morning couldn’t be more helpful apologising and moving us to a tower room and saying they will compensate us for our ropey start by waving our room tax which we thought was great This room was far better but was overlooking the Uber pick up which again played music 24/7 and this can be heard as clear as anything during our stay. On checking out we were charged with full amount of room tax to where the rude woman behind counter said why should we compensate you we moved you to a better room and basically told us to go away as nothing had been noted from previous conversations. It’s fair to say I’ll never be going back to this hotel and I would recommend anyone looking to go to vegas to pay a bit more and stay and a better hotel.  Don’t get me wrong there was good things within this hotel the titanic museum was good the pool area is nice and relaxing but there is far better places to stay and the majority of the staff are rude and unhelpful
50,We absolutely loved our stay in Las Vegas and especially our stay at the Luxor. Great staff great food and amazing gaming. We come back to the Luxor time and time again. And the MGM Rewards program is fantastic! Absolutely love it!!
30,Staff is kind and knowledgeable. Rooms are outdated and dirty in spots. We did not have hot water to take showers on our last day. The mobile check in/out was very nice and would highly recommend doing it this way.
20,Poor housekeeping visibly dirty bathroom and jacuzzi. Floors unkept without vacuuming or mopping done. No clean bedding/linens provided after room service. Layers of dust and grime around jacuzzi tiles.
20,Room was dirty sink in the bathroom was clogged and the shower drain also  I understand it’s an older hotel but upkeep is important  The room just looked like other Ed was made and nothing else was done for the next person
40,Overall stay was good. Had issue with shower flooding but issue was resolved immediately. We were moved to a different room with a simple call to the front desk. We would definitely stay at Luxor again.
40,Located just a short taxi ride from the airport at the top end of the famous Las Vegas strip.  Check in was a tad slow although we were a party of 22 and there was confusion over Resort fees with two rooms not having to pay for it! You also have to leave a credit/debit payment of $200 for incidentals.  The rooms in the pyramid are basic and very dated and could do with an up grade. One of our a party had a larger newer room in the tower and was the only one of our 11 rooms to have a bath.  Vegas is very expensive and all of the eateries inside the hotel are costly for the quality of food on offer. The hotel has a convenience shop which is also on the pricey side (£9 for a can of beer!). Save your money and do your essentials shopping at Walgreens or ABC stores.  There is plenty on offer by way of entertainment and Bodies and the Titanic Experience are well worth a visit.  All the rooms come complete with a safe and ice machines are available on all floors.  To operate the lifts you have to touch your key card which then only allows you to press for your floor.  A decent stay but a serious makeover is required.
40,Stayed solo and met up with a buddy for his birthday. Room did the job great value for the price. It's on the strip close to the airport and you can pretty much walk or take a free tram to other casinos further along the strip.
30,Not only was our room dirty with old soaps but then we had staff walk in on us twice and once while we were getting ready and naked. Terrible experience this time.nothing was done to resolve the issues and I would advise training on house keeping.
40,The towers were very nice to stay. Super clean and comfortable but the walls are paper thin. You can hear everything. Lupe was so sweet and amazing. Over all it was a good trip but excited to go home and sleep.
20,The tv remote didn’t work when asked to get it fixed they just brought a new one up. The exhaust fan in the bathroom didn’t work which left the room muggy and unbearable at times. Also there was a dirty cleaning glove left in the bathroom under towels. Absolutely disgusting.
10,This hotel is dated and gloomy. I cannot recommend it in any way. The room hadn’t been properly vacuumed and definitely could use an upgrade. I felt like I was staying at a cheap motel. This is a hard pass.
40,I like staying here because its a classic Vegas experience and a good value. Nothing fancy but Vegas done right. I like the upgraded rooms and quality of the food at the restaurants. Parking is good and clean too. Good place for business people to stay and get to conferences.
20,$300 a night for a substandard hotel. Poor service hotel key on app only works sometimes had to get a regular key once the elevator wouldn't work without one. TV broke water leaking from pipe in hall.
30,Bell staff did not offer any sort of assistance with baggage to room and assumed as if they were not going to be tipped anything immediately based off brief interaction when attempting to store and or pick up bags from storage. Room did not have personal use mini fridge (HAVE to pay for) nor was complimentary continental breakfast included with stay which is normal practice even amongst basic hotels…Room was clean but average and in room TV could not be personalized if wanted (Roku Netflix etc) due to presettings even if you bring your own cables. Mobile check in was very nice but mobile APP acted up quite often and required you to log back in often. Would prob stay elsewhere but would consider again if above certain issues were considered to be adjusted/included…
50,A super easy hotel to stay at with a big coolness factor.  great staff excellent casino people that make you feel at home.Breakfast buffet was always fabulous! Don't forget to sign up for MGM rewards so worth it!  I'll be back!
20,My company booked me here for a conference. The location is convenient and the room was not dirty. That's about all I can say.  The beds were broken down. The furniture was dented and dinged more than any thrift store find. The shower handle came off in my hand. The whole place smells stale and smoke-coated. If that's your expectation for your Vegas strip stay and get a good deal go for it but I've stayed at Holiday Inns that are a more pleasant stay.
40,Overall great just would be great to have room service. The rooms were nice and spacious. There was a little less outside noise if I would have been there vacationing the noise would have not bothered me at all. Overall great location with great staff.
20,The hotel is located far from everything. It is outdated rooms with yellow lights (all individual so need to turn them on and off one by one) old dusty carpets. There is no housekeeping on a regular base only if you implore. Needs a good renovation.
20,The mobile check-in process was difficult - many had issues with it. The guest rooms were very dirty - doubt they were ever cleaned. The hotel looks very dated needs an extensive remodel. The restaurants were not very good. The overall appearance of the property was rundown.
50,Everything was perfect. Room was ready when promised. Room was perfect and the whole ambience was perfect! The staff was very friendly and professional. The restaurant inside had some great food. The casino was also great.
40,"Stayed here with my parents for the Elton John concert. The property is dated and a bit run down here and there but the room was nice and you can't beat the location and the value. If you are going to an event at Raiders stadium this hotel is right on the walkway over and was easy to get in and out of. We had an updated ""stay well"" room on a higher level of the pyramid which fun. It features extra in room filtration which my mom who has sensitive lungs appreciated. You could not tell the room was in a casino. All the staff we interacted with were friendly and helpful. Super easy parking. Only bummer was a lack of food options - food court was all junk. Since we had a car we ate off property but if you were flying in and stuck there you might want to walk to another property. The pyramid elevators are a trip - pretty wobbly but I think they are fun just don't be too drunk or you'll probably fall over when they move. Overall great location and value. Are there better nicer places to stay sure - but for what this is it's a fine place to rest your head between all the fun you should be having in Vegas."
40,I attended the SEMA show and some relaxing. I have stayed at Luxor for years. Vegas is still Vegas it’s just starting to show it age. I love staying here .it’s has just the right amount of people and action to satisfy me. In need of updates. I will come back.
10,Can’t escape the bad smoky air. I tried to change rooms but there was no assurance from staff that any room would be any better. Staff were curt and unsympathetic. Bathroom was dirty. Exhaust fan was broken.
10,The bathroom shower was clogged with hair. Maintenance came and unclogged it. We were informed that housekeeping would come thereafter and clean. It took hours. We were not able to shower due to the filth left behind in the shower after the repair. We had to call housekeeping again to request a cleaning. We also found and killed a roach. We contacted housekeeping again whom promptly came and cleaned. We still have the picture. This was my 4th time staying at the Luxor. I don't think I will return.
30,The rooms are in need of updating and they lack any sort of amenities you would find in other hotels like a coffee maker or fridge. The casino and restaurants are good. Spa services were good as well . The only negative is the rooms are just ok.
30,West Towers had much better room than a previous time I was in East. But there is just a ton of smoke and smell that is unbearable. The desert air is already dry but add the smoke and one cannot breathe at all and will start to choke at night. Clothes smell of smoke too. Btw- for whatever reason I only had 3 hangers total. Like one per day. So had to drape my coats and outer light sweaters (it was cold in Vegas). That part was a bit confusing. LOL
30,No usb ports in rooms poor selection tv channels overpriced prices raking for hotel guests. Food way below par for this property the maids were the only good part of our stay every time you walked in or out a casino employee would try and give you a free show to join resort timeshare it was very bothersome to continually be hounded.
50,Will come back soon!!!! The food was great and the place was a beautiful place inside...the tables were always fun to play ...I wish we had more restaurants open late at night but the backstage deli is a great place to eat
10,Entering the room it had a weird smell to it wasn’t a clean smell. Checked out the bathroom had gray spots all over the floor and around the toilet area shower head had some gunk on it. I’m glad I only had to stay there for one night never again.
50,We had a great stay aside from Check-In. The front desk told my friends the card on file wasn't working and that they needed to provide a separate one. They claimed they had no way to re-run it and needed to physically have it but I hadn't boarded my plane yet and wouldn't be there for hours. I was able to call and the customer service rep resolved it over the phone with 0 issues in a matter of seconds. Not sure why check-in was so difficult and the front desk could not fix it but they were not friendly or accomodating at all and basically dismissed my friends.    Aside from that I always have a great time at Luxor :) wonderful pool spa and amenities with great location close to anything one could need to do in Vegas.
40,We stayed in the King Corner suite in the pyramid. Big suite and super quiet and clean. The gambling was good and the hotel has a great buffet. The only drawback for us was the location is not central but it was a really good experience overall.
10,The room was supposed to be an upgrade from the staywell suite. It was just a typical room. It was very dusty and the carpet was sticky. The dressers were very dusty. The bathroom had black mold in the shower on the walls. The drain plate in the shower would slide all over and the drain was disgustingly gross with crud and rust it never drained and would fill up while you showered. The bathroom sink was filthy full of old tooth paste. The mirrors haven’t been cleaned in who knows how long. The tub was oily and gross from old residue. It’s sad you have to wash things before using. The service was horrible. They came in and left the garbage and dirty towels. Only made the bed that’s it!! I had to call housekeeping and let them know. They dropped off clean towels and didn’t look very happy. I have been to Las Vegas numerous times snd stayed in numerous places on the strip. This was the worst one I ever stayed at. Never had any problem anywhere else. I would not recommend this to anyone.
10,Rooms were ok but grossly overpriced for the value - difficult to navigate & operate - isolated by a lame 3 hotel tram - staffed with foreigners that you cannot understand and the MGM app stinks - no receipt for my stay - cant even view your rates and charges - keep looking - avoid MGM as a whole - unfortunately they own most of the strip
30,"It's ""fine"" Not super cheap and you get what you pay for. Room lighting is terrible. Ask for a room close to elevators or you will be walking forever. Stores in hotel are rips off $6.00 for a small Pepsi"
50,Had a great time at this wonderful hotel. Our first ever visit to the U.S and what a trip it was. So much to choose from when it comes to food and drink and that's before you even set foot outside.    Don't be afraid of queues there are loads of them. Little coffee tip. Download the Starbucks app and order your coffee from there. Will save you a long time in the queue although that may only be a good tip for U.S residents as my U.K app wouldn't work.    Learn to say 'No thanks' as lots and lots of people will ask if you want free s*** that isn't really free as holiday time is really expensive.    We found the hotel tidy and clean (always see a member of staff cleaning something somewhere). Room was really big and clean too. The only downside is like others have said no fridge in the room (can be hired for a fee). We choose to take a cool bag with us to fill with ice for drinks (I believe there is an ice machine on every floor).    If you don't wish to have a bill at the end that doesn't seem right I suggest never booking anything to the room just in case you have one of them drunken order anything nights we all like to have ever now and then.    All staff that we interacted with were amazing. Thanks guys for a great stay.    We enjoyed Vegas so much it took all of 2 weeks back in blighty before we booked next year's trip back to the Strip. Who says you can complete Vegas in a few days? Lies....
50,Always clean and rooms are so quiet. Even stayed close to elevators and ice machine and never heard anything. Have stayed here several times with excellent experiences every time. Definitely recommend.
30,Customer service was the Best I've Experienced...and I live in Nevada. The rooms were so so and way overpriced but I know that fluctuates. Popcorn ceilings!!! The beds were comfy and the pillows terrific....going to order a couple!!
10,The hotel billed my stay completely wrong and then made it difficult to check out because I had a balance which was only because how the staff billed my stay. One of the hotel operations managers treated me with such lack of care and refused to offer me any type of satisfactory solution I'm still speechless about her and how she proceeded to deal with my problems that were caused from her hotel in the first place.
50,I enjoy my stay and accomadation and staff was very nice and very knowledgeable about different parts of casino and other casino that were apart of the same franchise New York MGM Excalibur and MGM Park
40,Who doesn’t like to stay in a giant pyramid rooms were clean and I did better on the craps here! The titanic experience is great along with bodies. Also a great location if your flying to nhl or nfl games
10,When I booked the Luxor I was told that all the rooms were remodeled during the pandemic. This cannot be true because my bathroom was extremely old and disgusting. I had to wash my sink before using it in the shower did not drain to the point where I had to lean over the tub from the outside to wash or I’d be standing dirty water.
50,Clean and well maintained courteous and professional staff excellent service as needed. Worked well throughout my stay. A coffee machine should be added to room so upon wakening up a fresh start can be experienced. Lines at Starbucks are too long.
10,Got stuck in the west wing elevator for over 30mins with my bf brother and sister in la2 heading to the room with our key that didn't want to work properly. I'm claustrophobic and my sister in law has seizures so the fact we were able to keep calm till the last few minutes is a miracle. Luxor gave us $50 room credit to brush it off yet apparently this os common because it was known a different elevator gets stuck like it's OK. If being stuck in an elevator is normal I definitely do not recommend.
10,They gave me a terrible view rooms need to be renovated like yesterday no mini fridge in room only suites get them which is stupid sink was backed up. Just overall terrible experience for my birthday one to remember never again Luxor.
20,Overall it was a disaster from checkin to checkout. Even the wake-up call came ten minutes after requested time suite was dirty upon arrival host requested clean. Call answering was a mess. Not easy to connect to your party
30,Stayed in East Tower. Maintenance needed to be done to room. I am sure it’s probably the older section but needed work. Appreciated the check in by App!! Saved a lot of time. Long line to check in. Didn’t have to go to front desk at all! Loved that. Easy parking too
20,Hotel was very old and room did not have anything. No safe to keep valuables no fridge to keep any drinks no microwave. No view. Last day there were no hot water had to take cold shower in November before catching my flight. Price was more than $1000 for 3 nights. Totally bot worth the value
40,Nice hotel plenty of amenities. Restaurants gambling easy access to get taxis and Ubers. I was on the first floor that was good for easy access to my room. The only thing I was close to the elevators so I heard all the hotel guest getting on and off. Especially the loud ones. But overall hotel is nice I would stay there again.
30,Unacceptable behavior from the manager on staff upon checking in there was a mix up with my accommodations had to find another place to stay until we could check in 12 hours later. It was her attitude that made this a unpleasant experience for us
20,Old and out dated. Lack of elevators made everything take so long to get too. Had a great view of the stadium but they had the window covered with an advertisement so it took the view away. Rooms hate bare bones no amenities not even a closet. They called them queen beds but they seemed smaller
40,The elevators move very slow BUT they go at an angle so it’s okay! Sometimes the key card on your phone doesn’t work in the elevator/takes like 6 tries haha. The room itself was beautiful and the beds were so comfy! Fell right asleep each time and enough plug ins for our phones! Had tons of fun at the blackjack tables and I would say the strip is about a 10 minute walk. The aquarium next door is totally not worth $30. The food was wonderful inside. The food court was overpriced but it was good nonetheless. Lines were very long at front desk but move very fast! The downside is the bell hop system they have I just wanted to take a cart myself so I can have my stuff right away and not wait for them to bring our stuff on their time… unfortunately they wouldn’t let me do that. Finding the parking lot was honestly confusing but eventually got there. Huge hotel.
20,We had a long walk from our room but it’s so long of a walk to get back to noisy ac units couldn’t sleep at all. No room service to get garbage or to give you towels. This the first mgm Property that I haven’t enjoyed
50,Great laid-back casino with great service. We stayed there for four nights and had a great time. The drink staff was everywhere the shows were great (saw Carrot Top and AGT) and the suite we said in was amazing.
30,Score 3.8-5    Pros:  The Casino is very cool and has many things to do. Blue man group an carrot top play nightly and they have a king tut and titanic exhibit. The food choices are also plenty and the staff was nice. The room was clean and the app you use to check in and out is intuitive.  Cons:  Food is very expensive (but that’s everywhere you go on the strip) our room was over 150 a night and it did not include a fridge or microwave and the channels on the tv were very limitedThe pool closes at 5pm which is fairly early if you are under 25 they will not give you any free vouchers which seems backwards considering our youth is broke.    Would definitely give them a mid 4 out of 5 rating if they made fridges and microwaves standard for next time
20,Don’t pay for parking - you will be burned. My key card issued after paying for daily parking was supposed to work for exiting property - this did not work. Went to desk - they assure this would be fixed - took the card. Nope - still had to pay to exit. 👎
10,When arriving self-park was definitely not helping especially with lots of extra sports gear. The room was gross the light switch was dirty walls and mirror all had some type of splatter on them. The worst was coming back to the room after being outside and having to take cold showers. This happened several times during our stay.
10,This hotel should be shut down and completely gutted it's very poorly maintained and was the topic of discussion in every elevator ride with stranger. When I mention to anyone that I was staying at the Luxor I got the same response that hotel is the worst. Now I see exactly what they were talking about. Most of the people who I know that have stayed there said they would never stay there again. I'm sure as long as the hotel is making money for MGM they don't care what the room experience is like at this property and that's a shame.
20,"We stayed at Luxor several times in the past and it was always a pleasure. This time though we had a poor experience. The room we were given had no functioning tv no functioning outlets no functioning a/c. It was freezing. We were given another room which in the words of the concierge was ""an upgrade at no extra cost"". It was exactly the same room as the one we had before. What's more after the first night no one had bothered to clean it. I called four times the first day and every time I was assured they were sending someone asap which didn't happen and at the end I let it go because it was exhausting. The third day I called housekeeping twice to make sure they would clean the room before us getting back at night. This didn't happen. They sent someone after two phone calls and at five pm and they ""cleaned"" the room in ten minutes leaving the carpet as dirty as it was before and they didn't even leave fresh towels! Finally the last day of our stay after another couple of phone calls everything was done properly. I won't be staying at Luxor ever again."
10,Don’t ever stay here. Staff is rude. Rooms are moldy smelling AC never cooled down enough. Check-in took an hour and it was like going through a tsa line. Elevators are janky hallway smelled like throw up. Couldn’t sleep because it was too hot. For the same exact price you can stay at the Aria. This hotel needs to be demolished or completely redone. I’ll never stay at an MGM Resort again.
10,If you are looking for a low-cost room in a great location you are at the right place. The hotel is in a state of disrepair. Nothing works elevators are a prime example. It's just an old hotel that has not been taken care of; it is that simple. The staff is very good and the location is great but it is hard to overlook the conditions of your surroundings
50,Tower rooms are the best! Pretty and comfortable room! Although your at the end of the strip your great walking distance to all other main hotels like Mandalay Bay New York New York Cosmopolitan Paris etc.
40,Check in can be a pain here! MGM app advised. Got a East Tower Queen Premium very nice clean. Furnishings a little wore like most older Vegas properties. Excellent brunch buffet on a BOGO from MyVEGAS. Had dinner at Diablo’s steak fajitas. Excellent staff and food. Gaming is great here unless you want a drink! Terrible! Just not enough staff? Lots of shopping and places to eat. Would be great for a 4-5 day stay!
50,Normally stay at the Luxor when visiting Las Vegas but is the ideal place to stay if you are going to an event at the Allegiant stadium as you can walk to the event even if you have someone in a wheelchair as the close the bridge to traffic from Luxor to the stadium.
40,I enjoyed the Luxor however I don't feel the rooms lived up to the price tag. Bathrooms were good sized and clean but water pressure was weak. Rooms were good sized and furnished well but the tv was was difficult to use fuzzy like a tv from the 70s and every time I turned it on the volume was absurdly loud. Pool area was great. Eateries and bars inside were great. Entertainment was great. I also really appreciated the mobile check-in and check-out it was amazing to not have to stand in line to do those things. I would definitely stay at Luxor again and would recommend to a friend interested in staying on the Strip.
20,The room was very noisy you could hear a pin drop in the next room. For the amount of mo ey they're demanding for these rooms there are much better options. The smell of smoke also drifts all the way into your room. I couldn't imagine staying on a lower floor. I would avoid this property if possible.
10,Peeled wallpaper stained marble floor missing light bulb on hallway. No refrigerator nor coffee maker. Room is somewhat dirty and dated. Check in/ out was way harder. Took 2 hours (midnight to 2 am) to check in. Very disappointed...
10,Looks like the rooms were robbed. There is No fridge or no coffee pot. The rooms are dingy and old way past time for an update. The room was very loud from people and music it is a very crappy hotel layout. Our party of 6 all with different rooms had the same complaints.
40,Overall very happy with getting the complementary suite. Room was clean and well kept. The rewards program on my players card is super confusing for me and probably similar age people like me. Seems like the MGM app and staff at the front check in don't communicate effeciently.
40,Nice beautiful excellent very close to Allegiant Stadium walking distance… the romos were very clean… there were no water bottles in our room you Have to purchase them at the machine outside. Pool was unnatended the whole 3 days we staid.
20,We stayed for a week and how the hotel has changed. It’s very busy noisy and looks both tired and dated. Even the reception staff complained to us about having to work listening to the bands playing since they can’t hear what guests are asking for as they check in.  Our room in the west tower was large clean and comfortable but also dated with money needing to be invested into the bathroom. Queueing for coffee at Starbucks in the lobby in a morning often took 20 minutes or so and the convenience stores in the lobby were hugely expensive. So how does it compare with newer hotels on the Strip? Sure some which we visited were slightly more expensive but not excessively so. The rooms in those which we visited were modern clean and large. Would we stay at The Luxor again? No.
10,When we entered the room it had a very strong bleach smell. I joked that someone cleaned up a crime scene. Not wanting to make a big deal we went out that evening thinking the smell would dissipate as they were at 100% capacity and we were there with friends. The next morning I dropped something on the bathroom floor and when I went down to pick it up the baseboards and the bathroom corners had blood spatter EVERYWHERE!! Some diluted with what I assume was bleach but some were very fresh!
10,I've been coming here since shortly after they opened and at the time it was a fun novelty. Now it's worn down and the structure itself needs help paint and new furniture can't hide. The inclinators sound like they're about to fall apart the water reeks of sulfur in the sink and the Digital checkin fails and if it happens to work for you it won't work to get your elevator pass because you won't have service. I used to love it here and I'm so sad to see it so run down.
40,Overall a good hotel for the price compared to other hotels on the strip. Location was really good for where we wanted to go on the strip. Lots to see at a walkable distance. Elevators (2B) aren’t maintained very well and it took a longer time than I’m used to when asking for face towels. The staff we had interactions with were very nice. The room was decent. The bedding had some minor staining (from oil maybe) the lighting could have been better the toilet made a weird loud noise prior to flushing. But other than those few small things we enjoyed our stay.
40,i know all these big casinos are the same but find it annoying the price we pay and no comps. could at the least offer water bottles. maybe have a check in package. the beds and staff was great. i was at the pyramid side.
50,I had a good time at the casino. Hope to come back soon. I will refer friends and family. Would love to come early next year. Restaurants and casino were convenient. Also the titanic was excellent. It was my boyfriends birthday and he had a great time.
20,Updating is needed at this hotel - chairs are in need of repair in bars and restaurants - MGM needs to use some maintenance monies at this facility - room service is non existent - hot water fluctuates
20,Guard your wallets. Coffee maker and fridge removed from the rooms to drive customers to over priced Starbucks food court and bars. $29.00 for a Burger two fries and a bottle of water. $35.00 a day resort fee is a shameless way of inflating the advertised price of the room. Take your business elsewhere.
20,Arrived late in the evening one night was going to come back but we won’t be.    We got a free upgrade upon arrival and I hate to think what I would have thought in a normal room.    The hotel is dated the rooms and circulation areas were not in good repair at all. I wish I would have taken photos of the wall paper hanging off walls and the lifts with graffiti And electrical panels hanging off.    Check in was easy and customer service from the guy was really good.    The place was basic dated and dirty in circulation areas.
50,Great establishment. Rooms could have been better though. We paid for premium and we didn’t even get a tub mini fridge or a microwave. The early check in could be improved. Maybe a special line for early check in confirmations or make the digital keys available on the app for early check in.
30,It was adequate for the one night we stayed unfortunately the bed and pillows were lumpy and uncomfortable. The elevators were painfully slow and the desperate hard-sell from the beauty shop on the way in was tiresome. A nice-enough room but would have appreciated a coffee maker. The lobby is a long long way away!
20,Never received maid service entire weekend. Old coffee splattered on the walls and used candy stuck to the furniture. Concierge service disappointed me in the balloon bouquet I ordered for my daughters 21st birthday it never came.
50,The Luxor is a perfect option for those looking to come to Las Vegas. The check in was easy and the staff friendly. It’s just a little south on the Las Vegas Strip but monorails buses or walking easy
40,If you want to be close to the roughness but have a nice home base Luxor is for you. You can go to the Excalibur (excrapular) and see a scene or go to the mandalay bay and be fancy. Stayed several times and never a bad experience. If you want to explore the strip though it is second to the last on one end.
50,One of the best experiences I’ve ever had. Stayed at the east wing and my goodness from when you enter the room to the bathroom it was 👌 “click click” when you jump on your hotel bed to taking a long hot uninterrupted bath phenomenal.
30,It was a beautiful hotel it was just a huge inconvenience on the financial mishap on my account. You really need to look into retraining some of the management. The regular staff are way more kinder sadly to say….
50,We found a great rate last minute for a Friday night and even when we were concerned with many reviews we had a great one night stay. Room was clean starbucks on site early checkin was welcomed and did not have to wait that long. We would go back in a heart beat.
20,We haven't been to Las Vegas for a long long time. My expectations and recollection of the hotels on the strip was that they were very well maintained. Our room was definitely outdated. The bed was comfortable though.
40,The lighting was horrible no lighted mirror in the bathroom to apply makeup there was not a additional security lock on the inside of the door it made me uneasy and digital key did not work was service was great
10,Staff lies to you in check in and doesn't even try to fix any problems when you present it to management. Very unsympathetic and uncaring after tou have spent money there. They love you and promise you whatever when you check in but don't honor it when it comes time. Will not be back.
40,Despite many people checking in the process was smooth and without hassle. The rooms were well equipped and the noise level was good late at night. The restaurants were good except the buffet is below average and worth skipping. The hotel is very clean and the service people were helpful when needed. I recommend Luxor as a good mid price hotel option .
50,Luxor was incredible I was on Ft with an employee. My parents were lost and speak no English. Somehow my mom made small talk with Carolina(a restroom attendant)who helped my parents back to there room
30,Sink have a big leaks the water was poring all over the floor and the clean towels  The dryer was damage and second one was provided will be better to remove the dame he one and leave a working one.  Have to pay for parking every Cesar’s Propiertys are free for guest.  Over price food on the food court
10,We must have gotten the crappiest room they have to offer. Next to the lobby & casino loud music blared through our door all night long…. no sleep at all. Got a super romantic view of some pipes out the window and a service ladder. Not to mention the tacky drywall repair —— while all that is bearable the black mold that was under the peeling wallpaper was the nail in the coffin for me. Will never visit again if black mold is the standard.
40,This was a fun themed Hotel in Vegas at a very reasonable price. It is a little dated and the Hotel could use some minor Maintenance. For the price and being on the strip it is worth it. They have some great shows there.
50,The Luxor offered an exceptionally nice room in a great location on the main strip. The room was clean and pleasant. Lots of food options in the food court as well as other close by restaurants. Close to both sporting facilities. I would stay here again.
30,It was just a super underwhelming experience for me. We stayed in the actual pyramid and the room we stayed in was not what I would expect for Vegas. Out dated kind of second rate type of a stay. Bathroom shower would clog and we'd be standing in water by the end of our shower - and not just a little water either. Beds were hard and uncomfortable and pillows were scarce and flimsy at best. No USB ports anywhere in the room like you'd see at any other hotel. The hotel itself was very difficult to navigate with no maps of any sort either in the map or in the facility itself.
20,Needs major updates on everything including staff. Overpriced drinks and restaurants leave much to be desired. The tram to other resorts is a nice touch to help you escape the reality of being a guest in the outdated rooms. Showers are lukewarm. Walk to Mandalay Bay by way of casino is nice.
10,There is nothing I can say that would even come close to being positive. Room was rundown no Wi-Fi food at buffet was low quality with little selection. Expensive cab ride to nicer part of the strip. The. only value was what they took from me. I know they really don’t care what I have to say. Be warned and look for my review.
10,"During my stay at the Luxor I don't believe I received anything but a poor experience. During my stay the only thing I wanted to do was leave the Luxor for any other property or experience. The check in took almost two hours bouncing around various lines and holding lines. They were finally willing to get me in a more expensive room that was generally dingy and the ""view"" they said would be good was HVAC equipment and the back of other Luxor towers. Any time I tried to contact the staff for things like towels we only received lip service and no towels. The whole experience was just bad."
10,No hot water ever torn up carpet and wall paper. Elevator shakes so hard a man fell against the wall. Long hallways to your room. Escalator always broke. Hard to find anything no signage. Slot machines are set to literally never win.
20,Bleh. Hotel was musty shower was clogged didn’t have a fridge to store anything but the casino was great. Don’t stay just play! Honestly stay at another place but come for the fun here. It has changed a lot but it’s ok.
10,It's not worth the expense of $40 extra per night for resort fees and you can't even get a cheap cup of coffee in your room 😑 😒. They don't explain anything so if you're going with a group make sure you are all on the same floor same tier and same elevator bank otherwise you'll have to meet in the lobby or worse get stuck in part of the hotel
10,Our room was not very clean they forgot towels we had to call 3 times to get them… next door room people were extremely loud and fighting constantly yelling and cursing and we could hear everything through the connecting doors… however we didn’t get relocated called front desk and we never heard back our tv was broken none of the channels worked they came to fix it but didn’t work… so we hanged out at other hotels and came to sleep… bummer cause this was our 25th Wedding anniversary and on our honeymoon we went to Luxor I was gonna book elsewhere but we wanted to stay there for memories… bummer!!!    I did ask for an upgrade to surprise my wife but manager never came out to talk to me… bummer!    Not sure we want to go back… and kinda surprised for Luxor cause it’s been so different before!
50,Spent minimal time in the actual room but the casino and restaurants were great. The staff was all exceptional. The pool was open and warm (which is the primary reason we chose this hotel initially) . Will stay again!
20,extremely disappointed in the buffet. I will never eat here again. Food was cold hard pancakes no flavor. not happy with food quality for the price. I will not recommended this buffet to anyone. It was a waste of money.
10,Really wish there was more to the Egyptian theme like there used to be years ago. Modern Vegas is way too expensive for what you get. Everything is dirty and falling apart and everyone is trying to get a tip out of you for no reason.
50,Had an amazing stay at the Luxor! Plan on coming back and recommend staying there too! My room was great the view was amazing and my bed was comfy. The staff was very friendly and some really good restaurants.
50,The Luxor is still a fun place. Good food choices. Diablo cantina is a great place for a few drinks and different dishes. If your interested check out the Titanic exposition. The buffet is also a good value although closed at 3pm. Breakfast has a lot of choices and great fruit and salad bar.
50,Staff was amazing. Food was great! Very clean and they don’t put up with the riff raff of the homeless trouble makers! Cleaning staff was always a pleasure! Only issue I had was a staff member at the snack bar before AGT he was kinda rude. All the good definitely out way the bad that guy was having!!
50,The hotel was very easy to check into using the app. Rooms were good size clean hotel. They offered complimentary crib for my daughter. Staff was friendly and food court was easy to get to. Love that it was connected to other hotels for an easy commute
50,Service was great. Easy checked in and checked out. Our room was upgraded during checking in with no cost:) I had good relaxation good 💤 and felt replenished during my stay. Room ambiance and beddings makes your soul at peace🤙🏼
50,I love it it’s in the nice area close to different casinos close to church next to the stadium the ambience is awesome and will stay there again great place They have so many different places to eat or walk and you find something different
10,There were roaches in my room when I went down to front desk and literally showed them the picture of the two roaches that I find all they did was tell me all they can do is move me to the next floor.
50,I have no complaints everything was perfect! Check in and check out was quick. The rooms were nice and clean. The workers at the MGM rewards were very nice as was everyone else from every other department. I loved the buffet!
20,Can tell this location was once something but has not been up-kept well. Access panel on elevator was barely on with wires hanging out. Requested a mini-fridge to keep top of wedding cake which arrived promptly but did not work. Was never able to have compressor kick on. Really expected better but the overall experience felt like well we got you for now don’t care if you return
40,Reading the reviews I expected an outdated room. I got the Pyramid Room (King). The hallways to the room needed vacuum and cleaning at 1:30 PM. The room was very clean and not outdated at all. I liked the colors and tile in the bathroom. Walk in shower was excellent. Bummer there was only one sink. Furniture was I. Good shape though there were some minimal visible scratches but not too much to where it took away from the o real presence of the room. Bed was comfy and clean with fluffy pillows to boot. Chairs in the sitting area was uncomfortable for me but wife was able to fall asleep on it. No refrigerator was a bummer as well as no coffee maker thus no complimentary coffee. Overall it was better than a satisfactory room thus my rating. Last time I stayed here was over 10 years ago. Not disappointed at all.
40,My check in was great with the girl that help me but the room was dirty. I didn’t want to bother anyone on cleaning it so I decided to do it my self had old trash everything was wide with dirty rag. That’s the only thing I would change
10,I'm sure Luxor was amazing when it first opened. However it is now filthy worn down and missing multiple in room amenities including a mini fridge. It is overpriced for what you get -- lights that don't work no hot water showers in the morning terrible internet reception staff that walk into your room without knocking and digital keys that don't work in the elevators or in your room. Hotel pools at all the MGM properties were also booked the entire weekend. Ubers cost a ton regardless where you stay so if the strip out your door isn't a feature you need then you'd be better off finding a cheaper hotel -- at least it would be cleaner staff friendlier and you wouldn't be charged a daily resort fee for amenities you weren't able to use during your stay.
50,Great service check in was fast. The self check in option was very easy. The room was very nice and clean. Parking is very close and convenient to the hotel. Online checkout out was also easy. Overall a great experience.
30,Public areas need updating and maintenance hallways and elevator lobbies. The 24-hour cafe is always a good value so nothing else to say but to fill up the space here to meet the minimum what else but eliminate the 200 minimum
40,The hotel was great. I didn’t expect to see so many animals stay within the rooms. The dogs were dropping poop and it stayed there for two days. I love animals but I am also for tending to the needs as far as cleaning behind them. I think that there should be a floor for animals only. I feel like I have slept in a bed that once slept a pet.
10,Downgraded my suite and tried to spin it as an upgrade. Only after I called them out did they make any effort to compensate me. Even had the audacity to try and charge me a late checkout after all of that. Not worth the money
10,During check in I was asked if I wanted to upgrade my room. I said yes so I paid extra per night to upgrade. Looks like an upgrades comes with bugs in our room! So many bugs. I am beyond grossed out. We were given a new room what an inconvenience other than that no one offered to make it right.  (Which I must add we found a bug in our suitcase as we unpacked in the garage.. we didn't bring our bags inside just in case something like this happened). I finally went down to talk to a manager which I waited much longer for than I hoped. Sultan gave us a $100 credit to our room for drinks/food. Which I noticed I was still charged for on our bill.    2. Our second room we were given was right at the elevators which I understand it's Vegas but come on... we had yelling and screaming for many hours through the night. I finally asked people who were right outside our room to keep it down because my son was the starting pitcher in an important game that AM. They threw a bunch of nasty towels at our room instead.    I have six boys who are all in sports we come to Vegas often for tournaments especially baseball! This time it was only my 17 year old and I thankfully. But we feed them at the hotel restaurants or nearby. It isn't cheap but we love it. This was our first time at the Luxor and not happy.
50,Hotel and stay was fantastic. Stayed for a few days no disappointments. Front desk housekeeping staff at restaurants all were great. Had an issue with the tv picking up channels and a serviceman fixed within 30 min. Everyone was pleasant. Hotel has everything you need but great location on the strip to venture out as well.
50,Great price for game day weekend. Convenient to be close to Mandalay Bay for the walk over. The staff was very accommodating and I would stay here again for the next game I attend. An overall pleasurable experience.  Need the refrigerator back in the room though not for rent.
40,Had a great stay ! Rooms where nice. Lost my wallet at some point they found it for me and returned it with all its cash ! Food Court was a great option for late night food. Hotel was not over crowded.
20,The front desk staff clerk wasn’t inviting! The rooms bathroom was not cleaned properly i was very disappointed. Also the bed was hard and not comfy. I wouldn’t recommend this hotel or book anymore!!
40,Oh I was so excited to stay at the Luxor hotel. This hotel could use updating. There is no refrigerator in the room. My room did not have any heat. I was not providing any hand towels. And there is not a bar in the bathroom to hang a hand towel. The stores could provide hours of operations. There could be more Luxor merchandise added to the stores I was very disappointed in the availability. The Buffet food was very tasty and the lady hostess with the red hair was very nice.
30,Make sure that upon check in you ask questions. Don’t just hand them your card. Be prepared for. Price increase for no reason once you arrive. Inspect that your sheets are new and fresh. The casino is affordable but if they so call upgrade you. You end up paying the price of better hotels. The rooms are small.
20,There were multiple stains on the furniture making it look really dirty also sharp door handles that really hurt when you hit them the movie rentals didn't work on two different nights overall very nasty smell in the hallway not a very pleasant experience at all.
30,The pyramid part of the Luxor is very old and kind of rundown. Rooms need to be remodeled and casino floor was very smokey. The front desk personnel and the housekeeping were great. The food was very good except really expensive.
50,This is a very nice Casino and Hotel. Very Clean and located next to the walkway entrance to the Raider Football 🏈 Stadium. Walking distance to just about anywhere. The restaurants and bars are excellent. The Staff is Very Friendly.
30,Mainly wish there was hot water for the shower and tub! And why does this review require a minimum of 200 characters? That's silly. I guess I'll write more it was my bday and I just got engaged so I paid extra for a spa in the room which was really just a big bathtub with no jets and no hot water.... and I paid $1100 for 2 nights which is insane
50,My wife and I traveled for our anniversary and we had such a bad experience at another hotel so we decided to relocate and it was such a good time at the Luxo I would definitely visit again. Couldn’t be happier with our choice
20,After walking though the other hotels on the strip we will be staying somewhere else next time. Television did not work and kept disconnecting and losing its signal. No fridge or microwave in the room $100/night hotels on the east have these basic amenities.
40,Great vacation nice to get away. Luxor is good hotel not perfect. But a good stay beautiful hotel great shows (blue man group). Nice warm pool. Can't wait to go back definitely would stay at luxor again.
50,I love the architectural design of this hotel. It is one of the most unique hotels on the strip. The entrance and interior have all the touches of Egyptian art. Amazing restaurants and nightlife there
10,Heretofore to be known as the Suxor. There was trash in the room. The handles were literally falling off the shower doors. The receptacle in the bathroom was so old that anything plugged in just falls out. The beds are not queen size they are full size. The paint is peeling in the shower. There are a total of six (6) clothes hangers for two people for a week. No refrigerator no coffee maker no microwave oven. No soap dispensers in the shower. Management doesn't care at all and blamed us for choosing the room saying that all of our issues were addressed on their website. He aslo argued with us about the bed size. We actually have a queen size at home... No upgrade or compensation offered. Housekeeping hung up on me. Never again!    Room number 10023 10th floor. Checked in 10.28.22    We will just stay at the Motel 6 next time.
40,I had a great trip with my best friend. I especially loved the mobile check in. Unfortunately I forgot to get my rewarded card before going big at the craps tables but next time for sure. Luxor has always been a favorite and now it’s so close to the allegiant stadium super bonus. I’ll be back soon
20,The bartender near the sports book area told me to F off because I asked for a Pale Ale happened in front of my father in law. Luxor swing and missed grounded into a double play. Absolutely terrible. Even though the room was free that is the only thing I couldn’t get past. The room smelled like black mold and the room need a major remodel also (not one USB plug in)
30,From yaki at the deli restaurant to the casino cocktails. You cant ask anyone a question without getting a bad attitude or no response and just walked away from. The cocktail waitress slammed drinks in front of us in which one spilled. Another one walked away mid us ordering.  The bellman gave us a wrong ticket so i couldnt grab my luggage and had to physically go inside their luggage room to identify my stuff.  The hotel however is beautiful and they have such amazing amenities within and have very cool things to do once inside!!  The hotel rooms are super nice however they did not have a refrigerator.  The pool is beautiful!!! in front of the pyramid.
40,Hotel is fine no problems with it at all. However this stay my bed was a a creaky rock. Honestly that is my only drawback from staying again. I don’t spend much time in the room but when I do I want a comfortable bed. I was dragging on the last day of our trip because I was so tired.
30,The time has come when your 15yr Vegas travels catches up to you then you realize MGM needs to start updating some hotels surrounding hotels are surpassing the older hotels and the looks and feel are night and day difference. Its time to update we started going there when my kids are 3yrs old now they are in their mid 20’s and they are the ones complaining of how old the facilities are. The beds sink too my back started hurting A vacation sleeping on the floor oh well. I didn’t complain because I value my time with my family and my kids made me promise to look the other way and enjoy out times together. But now here is my chance since the trip is done.
30,Average visit  Room not clean  The mirror in room  Was Terrible  Stains on sheets and pillow cases  Front desk was nice and helpful  Rooms are far away from parking  Room smelled like smoke. Non smoking  Good value  When they upgrade you … is it really a upgrade ?
40,Specifically chose south end location for Raider football game day. Other than long wait at understaffed check in desk in the evening the west tower room we stayed in was adaquate. The room as well as the casino and restraunts were clean and well staffed. Maid service was daily even though we hung used towels as listed to save resources. Connections to other south end casinos/activities is good.
50,I’ve stayed at quite a few hotels on the strip of Las Vegas Boulevard and the Luxor always has one of if not THE best services and hospitality for one of the lowest price! There are always no complaints!
50,For our first time being in Vegas for the hubby's birthday and our anniversary it was great. The hotel was more then we expected it was very nice and clean. The staff was great and the restaurants were good! Can't wait to be back.
40,Location was great for the football game. Rooms need to be refreshed. A little expensive to eat. Directions to rooms getting around a little vague. Everyone was pleasant. Could have had shuttles/transportation between hotels. Taxis are cheaper than UBER
30,I would like the Manager of the pool & bar to contact my friend Patricia Gebor to go over the bill was overcharged already discussed but have not heard back & will call when I return home to BC Canada !
50,Clean room friendly staff and great comps if you have mgm card. I’ve stayed here 3 times and would stay again. My only concern was no heat in my room as it was cold at night but I didn’t report it just wrapped up and went to sleep
20,The rooms are old and smell. By the time I left everything in my bag smelled like the terrible room. The phone and the iron didn't work. Had to walk down to let them know and it never got fixed. Food available is so so but there are plenty of options around. Yes I saved some money but would have much rather spent more and stayed at a decent hotel. I've stayed in motels that were nicer.
20,We just left the Luxor and we had a fun vacation but the room and hotel was mediocre at best. We lost water pressure multiple times in the shower and sink. We would have literally no water. The noise of the elevator pulleys all night long was pretty annoying. There was mold growing on the bathroom ceiling. Long waits for elevators and you have to walk all the way around the floor to the one bank of elevators.    No clock in the room no fridge no extras at all. It’s really frustrating to pay these prices as well as the resort fees and you have no amenities.    The Luxor staff very friendly and kind.    Vegas is just so dang expensive especially if you are from another country. I still can’t get over what it cost to have fun on the strip amd I have been to Vegas many times. It’s ridiculously expensive!!!!
40,The Luxor was lovely with good sized bedrooms. The lifts are a little slow and decor needs updated. Bathroom is a good size with a large shower.  We were in room 7056 and I could hear part of noise from downstairs.  Casino was good and sometimes waitress would ask if you would like a drink.  Could get $7 draft beers or a bucket averaged at $30+  Food was lovely.  Pool area was lovely.
50,We stayed for a few days for a birthday getaway. We used the mobile app to do everything on our trip. The mobile app worked fine except for a little trouble using our phone to unlock the elevator we didn’t understand how the room key worked with the elevator. Everything went well.
10,Room was filthy and customer service is abysmal. When we brought the issue up we were greeted with nothing but hostility and personal threats from staff. This is beyond unprofessional and not what I’ve come to expect from MGM hotels. The banging on our door and intrusion at 5AM from hotel staff was nothing short of intimidation and made us feel threatened in our home away from home. Just for raising a complaint? I have been an Mlife member and staying at MGM hotels in Vegas over 15 years and this was a huge let down not the standard I’ve come to expect. We had to leave and moved to Aria the next day who were a lot more friendly and accommodating. Will not be going back to Luxor ever. Even with the comp offers not worth the drama and disgusting standard of service. Do you train your staff? What kind of people do you hire?
10,title says it all; of all the hotels on the strip do not choose the luxor as you will be very disappointed - on top of the very low quality rooms; staff can be hit or miss... most of them are very rude
40,Overall good. Ac never cooled not the enjoyable type of night sweating. Endless fees and in my pocket - vegas in general I guess. Just be upfront on costs and expenses. Limited room cleaning only got fresh drinking glasses one time in 4 days. The show $90 per ticket.. you would think a AGT pushed event would be the real deal not a show based on it... mislead quite a bit. Also no fridge? Got a little 6pack cooler brought up by HK but cmon....
30,The room was not so clean clogged sink and it was very small so we had to wait for it to clear. The was no refrigerator and space was there and it was removed. The room was cold and no maintenance person came to adjust the thermo to give us heat. No maintenance person to unclog the sink. The noise from the elevator pulleys did not allow you to sleep.
50,We had not been to the Luxor prior to this visit. It is certainly larger inside than we expected and the detail of the decor inside is exceptional. The hotel staff is incredible professional and courteous. We will definitely be going back!
50,This is by far the best place to be on the strip 10/10!! Highly recommend. There’s plenty of things to do. It’s very close to the raider games if you want to go. Me and my wife went to almost every hotel and this one was our favorite.
30,We just returned from our weekend getaway to celebrate my birthday and our anniversary in Vegas.    Positives:  - The room was fine.  - No dirt or noise issues.  - The Blue Man Group show was in the same building.  - Check-in and checkout were supereasy in the app.    Negatives:  - Location: The Luxor is located at the very south end of the strip and therefore requires a lot of walking or an Uber to get to the more central part of the strip. The tram b/w the Excalibur and Mandalay Bay is a little useless at the Luxor.  - Bed: The mattress was worn and the pillows were uncomfortable.  - Price/Value: the difference between weekday and weekend rates were dramatic. We paid way too much for what we got.  - Resort Fee: such a joke to pay for so-called “services” that are standard in all hotels outside of Vegas.  - Elevator access: requires a digital or physical key card to work. Digital key success was spotty.  - No refrigerator: We knew that there wouldn’t be a refrigerator. However there was clearly a space from where a refrigerator was once removed which is a little silly.    Overall we enjoyed our trip but will be looking for hotels close to the Monorail on the East side of the strip next time.
30,I've enjoyed this whole experience at Luxor from Centra Bar always friendly staff members the Raiders themed experience along with The Golden Knights. The location with the Stadium a short walk. Prices have risen but still a fun place to stay a few days. Rooms were cleaned. The hallways are taking their tolls with ripped wallpaper in th hallways clearly seen on all those cameras but not taken care of with a little TLC this place could be amazing again.
40,The Luxor has comfortable rooms great restaurants and attractions. It’s a great location that is connected to Mandalay Bay  Excalibur and the Delano and shopping. Whenever I come back to Vegas I definitely will book there again.
20,Safe did not work even though we called down to desk and they said they would fix. What do you bring to Vegas? CASH!! What do you need in your room? A safe that works! No coffeepot in room no manual lock on the door super loud bathroom fan that could not be turned off if you wanted to have light on. No hot water two of the days. There are so many other better places to stay on the strip. Will not stay here again. Felt like a cheap hotel
10,Not worth the $1k I paid. Parking was a joke most of the time the self parking was closed. Then we got charged for parking at a sister hotel. No heat in room the sitting room sort of blew hot air. Then we take a bath in the tub and the drain has a piece of metal sticking up almost cut my back on it.
50,I thought the trip was relaxing and was alot of fun. Everyone was so nice and I got a chance to meet alot of new people. One lady gave me a hundred dollars to play which I thought wa very nice. My experience was very enjoyable.
50,Loved the mobile app. No lines check in/out and room keys all part of your app.  Clean rooms but sounds from the hallways could be heard at all hours.  With the app I didn't have interaction with any staff. I wish the app explained which elevators belonged to which building/towers a little better. Missed the amenities of a fridge/microwave etc
30,This was the first time I've stayed at Luxor and honestly it wasn't bad. However I found the hotel interior old and dated. The elevators and room (the one I was in anyway) were well worn and overall beat up. The hotel is very dark both inside and outside and overall just did not have a hip vibe like the surrounding properties of not only Mandalay Bay but Excalibur. While not a bad hotel I would recommend to a friend or colleague going to Las Vegas that there are better choices available.
50,We love the shows  the atmosphere decorations and it’s clean !! The room very clean the Diablo food was really good we love that is close to Mandalay Bay we always go back and for the game area is clean we love it !!
30,Value for money was “terrible”. I felt like I was taken advantage of by MGM. I will never pay for one of your overpriced products. My family members had the exact same experience. This was my first time staying at an MGM property. I have shared my experience on social media with my entire community.
50,The staff were very informative and the cleaning crew was always ready to help when needed. There was a lot of things to do for events and the food here is insanely good. I recommend this hotel for anyone looking for a true vegas experience.
20,Hotel is understaffed with constant lines for anything like check in guest services or bag check. Hallways to rooms and elevators were filthy and some spots had the same trash for multiple days. Water pressure for shower sometimes disappeared and just slowly bubbled out of the head. I spoke to someone in passing on the 14th floor from the hotel and he stated that he would send someone up they never came. Ended up spending more time down the street at a nicer hotel my friends were staying at.
30,Nice refurbished room but overpriced. Needless resort fee on top of rate. Found facial hairs in sink from previous occupant. Traffic for parking and lines for elevators added an extra hour to arrival.
40,Went for weekend and to watch a football game in the new stadium. Was able to see a couple of shows and enjoy dining at some nice restaurants. And of course do a little bit of gambling. Quite a few options and a great location.
20,Beautiful room but very dirty. Hairs all over dirty shower floor used magic eraser found in the bedroom Very rushed cleaning job was very disappointed in the room. Good decor comfy bed but sad the buffet wasn’t open the days we were there.
50,I rated the value lower because I hate paying a resort fee and for self parking. I miss the old Vegas when these weren't real charges. Other than that complaint we had a nice stay. The room was comfortable and clean.
20,I have never stayed at the Luxor before. Very pretty on the exterior and as you walk in is great but their customer service was awful. Workers were probably having a bad day: rude and unhelpful. Also floors look like they have not been mopped in days. No coffee pots in rooms either.
10,Room we checked into was occupied. Shower was running and the room was a disaster. Front desk agent was rude offered nothing to make the mistake right. We offered $75 drink credit after I told them my wife does not drink. Staff at the Flight bar were also rude and just acted like they did not want to be there. All in all a very bad experience.
40,This older hotel has been updated many times but it is familiar to us and it’s comfortable for us. The staff is always super friendly and check-in is always fast and painless. I especially love the location of The Luxor and the tram that goes between it and Mandalay Bay & Excalibur. Great experience.
10,Entry level resort for $50 more you could stay somewhere where you're treated better. Issues with elevators and hot water. This is not a gambling friendly casino; you will not get comped if you lose here.
30,For the money the Luxor is a good place to stay without breaking the bank. Close to sporting events. Clean Rooms. Small things to note: No Fridge in Room Bed was comfortable. 2 Starbucks on site.  Overall I would stay again if the price was right.
10,You are just a decimal to them. They are not interested in making you feel welcome enjoying yourself having fun. They only want you to pay them and leave. They will trick you with the insane amount of fees and costs associated with staying there and then become very tight with giving anything back to you. Pay your room rate xxx$ Pay a resort fee 40$ then a parking fee 18$. Why is parking not included in my room rate or at least the resort fee? It is not the Vegas it used to be. They no longer care about visitor satisfaction. We are done after 20+ years of annual to bi-annual Vegas getaways. The luster is gone the old euphoric feeling one would get from being there has not been strong but declining steadily for several years.
30,We stay at the Luxor because we were told it was a requirement for the baseball tournament. We have been to Vegas numerous of times and stayed at the Mandalay Bay Stratosphere and Paris. The Luxor smelled of cigarettes and mildew I think the ventilation was not as strong as other casinos we visited. We walked thru the MGM Park Casino and it was a breath of fresh air no smoking was allowed. We had a problem with our shower and Sink being clogged we called the front desk and someone showed up in less than 10 minutes the repair man fixed the issue and we were satisfied with the outcome. There was some dried blood on the bottom of the toilet paper holder we made sure not to touch it for $300 plus a night I think it should have included a free breakfast or at least a drink. We also never got service when playing slots Maybe they are short staff but we never got a complementary drink.
10,Lets start by saying the front desk rep was rude! She clearly did not want to be a work that day and was very short with me. She literally hung the phone up in my face. It got worse from there.... There were bugs crawling in my friends bed! Big enough to kill with a shoe. That should be enough to not stay here but let me help a little more..... not 1 not 2 but 3 ppl walked in our room unannounced. they did not knock at all. They all had keys that worked and walked right in. one at 8;30am another around 10am and the third about 30 mins later. Yes I understand sometimes the maids come to make sure you're up and leaving however not at 8 in the morning and def not without knocking!!! the bathroom is next to the door...what if we weren't clothed?? Not to mention we had a late 12pm check out so that wasn't communicated either! run! don't walk! run!
20,This casino is old and it shows. Very disappointed in the shape of the room. Bed sheets were torn and heard of another customer having mold in his room. Very expensive and hidden fees in the fare. Did not know about.
10,I’m not sure where to start honestly. For the price paid the quality and service just was not met. I know it’s one of the older hotels on the strip but the upgrades are so needed everything is older then 20 years at this point. Cold showers every day never once got warm much less hot.
50,We came to Vegas for the Raiders game so we picked the Luxor because its close to the stadium. Our stay was good the beds are to small they need queen beds and they were a little hard. Other than that it was great staying there I will stay there again.
30,Poor ventilation in room. No heat and we were cold. Brrrr...  Room dated decor and maintenance issues. (A/C and some of the lights. Also no hot water in shower during busy hours)  Very long lines at VIP check-in  Has coffeemakers and fridge (kept thing cool not cold)  Close to allegiant stadium.
30,Suites are in such bad condition. Rooms and casino needs updating. I will not recommend staying here. My friends checked out after first night and moved to a Caesar property! At the same time staff were friendly.
40,I like the location because you can access numerous properties without risking your safety by going onto the Strip which has become a factor. The ekey for your phone doesn't work in the pyramid room area so precheckin is useless as you have to go to the desk for keys. Employees lack a since of urgency and don't start the opening procedures at the players club and Pyramid restaurant until the posted time for opening. The comp system was down when I attempted to redeem my comps and I had to postpone my use of my comps. The room was clean and comfortable but it did lack a clock and the location was as far as you could possibly get literally from the elevator. It was not designed with the elderly in mind (26097). The casino is as good as any and there are numerous dining and entertainment options available. I am a Pearl level military vet player(low roller) but MGM didn't charge me ANYTHING for the room which is a HUGE plus to me. Caesars would never do that at my play level. I wish MGM had a property close to my home as air travel makes their properties undesirable when it takes 9hr10min on a nonstop flight to travel door to door to reach them in Vegas.
10,enjoyed the stay nice atmosphere. pretty easy going place.not too many crazy ppl. laid back good for lowkey stay. staff is very friendly. one of the staff gladly helped me when i was having a hard time locating self parking
50,Went out to LV because I was gifted a plane ticket. A cousin and my brother were there for different conferences so I was able to hang with family. Staff was great. Room had some minor wear and tear that a picky person might not like.
40,The rooms did not have a closet or refrigerator. TV was poor quality. For the price paid was expecting a little more extras such as bottled water. The room did not have enough electrical outlets especially next to the beds.
50,The hotel is easy to navigate. The staff was extremely friendly and accommodating. I would definitely stay again. The rooms were clean and looked just like the photos online. We have no complaints at all. Being able to check in through the MGM app was super convenient. The hotel offers multiple late checkout options which was extremely helpful because we were flying out late. Our experience at Luxor was amazing!
30,The Luxor isn’t a bad hotel but when compared to the aria park mgm mgm grand or bellagio it lacks in the cleanliness luxury and comfortable department. For the price it isn’t bad but I probably wouldn’t stay here again especially if any of the hotels listed above are available
40,Had a fun experience. Overall customer service was good. Nothing bad but nothing special. Have old tvs in the rooms but that's my only complaint. I know who's in Vegas to watch TV in their room but still a smart TV with apps would be nice haha
50,I think Everyone should come there and stay it was easy checking in and out and everyone was so helpful and the room was clean and when you need something they are on it I would love to go back there soon
10,I was given a room that was a total dump the AC didn’t work lights were flickering some light bulbs were out the paint on the walls peeling and totally filthy. You could actually see the layer of dust on the furniture like they have not wiped that furniture in months. It was disgusting . I was changed to a better room but after going thru the bad experience. Go somewhere else. Save yourself a big disappointment and a bad time.
50,The staff is second to none; everyone is super friendly and helpful. Our host Ott ensured that our vacation experience was memorable. We will definitely be back. The rewards program is better than any other!
20,No hot water in any of our 3 rooms on the 6th floor for most of our stay. I would not recommend this hotel. It is not worth the price of the rooms. The food is only so-so but the servers were friendly and good.
20,Enjoyed the look and feel of the hotel. Unfortunately room service was impossible to get there are NO amenities in the room. No refrigerator microwave or coffee pot. In fact when called to try and use the phone to order room service was directed back to a site that I'd challenge the staff to use successfully.
50,Great location with the best show on site...carrot top! I've been twice and plan to go again next month! The tender steakhouse was amazing with the best wait staff. Drinks on casino main floor were awful and no booze but high limit servers were amazing with great drinks. I tipped well in high limit room 🙃
10,I will not be back. The hotel is nice essentially but the experience was not the best. The food was good but the staff was not friendly. The drinks are watery but the machines are clean. The bathrooms are very unclean.
50,Nice Property! The rooms are updated and modern. The resort is located in a very convenient location on the strip. The rooms were spotless and comfortable. We will definitely stay here in the future!!
10,Hotel appears to be clean but The pyramid is trashy and the room had mold. You can actually see trash bedsheets clothes in the pyramid. Not a sight that I want to see when I’m entering my room. The staff was nice. Everyone we encountered was pleasant except for the lady who checked us in.
50,This place is visually amazing and the staff is always friendly helpful and welcoming. When I book a trip to Vegas and I know I want a great experience I always choose the Luxor. They place and the people never disappoint.
20,We had bugs coming out if the sink drain. No help resolving with the staff… Bathroom door would not shut. Had to slam it really hard. Fan in bathroom was loud and sounded broken. Nephew’s room had no hot water. For the price the conditions are very poor.
10,Unfortunately this was not a good hotel experience. My sister and my daughter both got a rash from the room which they had to drink meds for and the rash took 3 days before it started going down. I did call the front desk they changed me from rooms but ti was the same outcome on that other move. Rooms are so old & more than anything they are so under cleaned carpets were disgusting I wanted to place blankets all over just so we did not need to touch carpet even with shoes on. The rooms smelled very bad and all in general was very disappointed will NEVER stay here again. Only God knows what were in those rooms the lack on sanitation & cleaning was very evident and this was not a regular room I had a suite you would think they would have it at a certain standard of cleaning which every room should regardless but it was a waist of money & made the trip unpleasant for that fact.
20,A very dated property and a poor ventilation system. The smell of smoke is overwhelming. A big win is that it is so close to the stadium so the convenience was terrific. Room TV didn’t work and the room had a crusty carpet.
10,This hotel was disgusting . The plumbing is terrible . There was hair from previous stays all in the bathroom and room floor as if it wasn’t swept . No refrigerator or microwave. Waste of money. RUN!!
40,When you are in a hurry use the MGM APP... its amazing. One issue was the first floor though.... no security and it was very noisy. The food and service were good clean rooms and great location. I would suggest it.
30,This is a decent choice for a trip. The location is a little out of the way from most things on the strip and is overall looking a little worn. The food and other non gambling facilities (gym spa pool) are nice.
50,I travel a lot for work and when I'm in Las Vegas I stay at Luxor. I don't like Vegas outside of the hotel. With Luxor I am able to travel between Excalibur Luxor and Mandalay Bay without ever leaving the hotel. Plenty of shopping and food to experience without going outside!
50,Me and my fiance stayed at the Luxor this past weekend and had a great time. Rooms where very nice. While on the floor thr staff was amazing and quick with the drinks. So far I have stayed at 4 different MGM resorts this year and all have been great.
30,Upon check in the room was not clean. Visible crumbs and debris on the carpet and we had to ask twice for it to be taken care of before it was tended to. Thermostat in the room was wrong; read 72 but it was much warmer and never cooled off. Even when we turned it down to 65 it was more like 75 in the room and then it would auto-reset back up to 72. Very difficult to sleep in such a warm room. And I'm always ALWAYS cold. This room was just never comfortable. They only cleaned/made up the room 3 of the 5 days we stayed there and one of those was after repeated request. Overall for what we paid I was unimpressed. I've stayed at Holiday Inns in the middle of the US that were better kept.
50,Everything about our stay was a plus except entering the room there were spill/liquid stains on the floor like they haven't mopped it. Went to use the bathroom and it was the same thing. Gross!    Other than that the staff members were very friendly & helpful! Maybe we'll visit again.
30,Check in line was crazy at 2am in the morning (and even then I heard rooms were not ready). Luckily some lady was nice enough to help me check in faster due to a medical condition. If you can highly recommend using their MGM phone app to check in.    The weekend rate I paid was really expensive compared to other weekday rates that you could get for cheap.    Rooms are very dated but overall I had a good sleep.    No free parking for hotel guests.
50,30 year anniversary for me and my wife and brought our son who recently had his 21st birthday. This was my son's first time to Vegas and he had a blast and is eager to return as soon as we are all able.
50,I enjoyed my stay at Luxor! All staff were very helpful and friendly! I would stay here again if I get to come back to Las Vegas! My room was very clean and spacious. Had several food options between the food court and numerous restaurants on site!
40,Rooms in pyramid could use a makeover. Resort was great staff was helpful the room was dated. Also AC didn't work well it was either way too warm in the room or freezing. We had a great time but would probably select a different resort next trip just to check out something different.
10,The rooms in the West Tower are the worst. The tile in the bathroom have permanent stains which almost looked like dry blood stains. Housekeeping cleaned the room once in 4 days and didn’t supply the room with the basics like soap. We only stayed because of the close proximity of the hotel to the football stadium. Huge mistake on our part.
10,Cheap stinks and too far. We had to Uber everywhere. It’s too far and it smells horrible. They have a problem with their sewage. My tub backed up twice. The came with a plunger and it did it again. Second room was ok but stinked as well. The entire west tower smelled like a drain.
50,Great Casino in fact the only Casino we visited that did NOT smell like cigarettes. For the price you get a great value for your money with very nice amenities including huge pools and lots of area to spread out. The atrium is gigantic and the open feel is very welcoming.
40,A lot of reviews of the Luxor mention problems with the pyramid rooms so I will start bu saying the room was spacious and clean (and regularly cleaned) and we had no issues with hot water or smells. Bed was comfy and considering you can walk out of your room and look down at the hotel floor below you it was incredibly quiet. The thick curtains and tinted windows also meant really good sleeps.    We were on floor 23 of the pyramid at the back looking out over the pools and the Allegiant stadium. Check in was quick and painless. The elevators (inclinators) climb at an angle up the pyramid and you can feel the incline as you go. They tend to rattle a bit but we had no issues with waiting and their unusual properties are part of the fun of staying in a pyramid.    Room was a nice size and basic but this is what you expect for thos hotel level on the strip. We only really use our rooms for sleeping so while the Venetian and Caesars have much nicer rooms they are a bit wasted on us. Shower was decent.    The hotel itself is fine but a bit out of the way if you want to be in the middle of the action. Only the Mandalay Bay/Delano are furthwr down the strip. There ia direct access to both the Mandalay and Excalibur by walkway or free tram but it is a decent enough walk from the Luxor to the Bellagio or Harrahs (especially in the heat). There is a Deuce stop outside coming back - if you want to get the Deuce north you need to cross the road to the Tropicana or MGM Grand. Uber pick up is reaonably easy to get to unlike some other strip hotels.    Wifi was good throughout hotel. Casino was fine but I prefer to gamble in others. There is the usual food court 2 Starbucks and a buffet. You also have Public House sports bar for food and Diablos for tex/mex.    Now I have the pyramid out of my system I would probably try a tower room if staying here again although we try and stay in a different hotel each time we go to Vegas.
20,I booked a Tower One Bedroom Elite King Suite (1050 sq ft). I booked it 4 months prior to arrival.  The day before arrival I checked the MGM Resorts App. It showed a One Bedroom Suite (780 sq ft). I was downgraded.  I checked in on the App. I was given a low floor (3rd floor).  The room itself was a disappointment.  ✅Specks of rust or dirt continuously flowed from the faucet of the bathtub (so I couldn’t soak in it).  ✅The stool at the foot of the bed was soiled and stained. Heavily. Nasty.  ✅The two TVs constantly turned off while I was trying to watch the news.  ✅In the hallway right outside my suite there was some type of machine turned on (the entire stay). It was apparently drying the wallpaper that was hanging off the hallway. I don’t understand why I was given a suite literally right beside this noisy little machine.  I have a video of the suite I may post.    On the positive…  👍Housekeeping was amazing! The lady was helpful and friendly and very professional.  👍The bed was extremely comfortable.  👍The shower was good; nice water pressure.  👍The couch was old but very comfortable.  👍Fridge in suite was nice.    👍On a side note I did my best gaming at Luxor. I returned home with more than double my original bankroll. The casino was very busy and fun. I recommend the Luxor Casino to everyone. Not so much the hotel.  (In all my years on TripAdvisor this is my first negative review of a room/suite). I hope MGM gives Luxor the love and updating it desperately deserves.    Feel free to reach out to me with your questions or comments.
20,God help you if you have bad sinuses or need to sleep. Second-hand smoke everywhere loud hallways and people long lines and nonexistent service made this a very unpleasant stay. I didn’t want to stay here in the first place because I’ve heard horror stories from others but the price must have been right for my small firm.
40,We stayed in a newly renovated pyramid room and have no complaints! Very fair experience from beginning to end for the value/cost ratio. Super friendly staff averagely good food at all the food outlets we tried throughout the hotel. Awesome casino.
40,Luxor must pay more points for our stay in ur place and get better food for ur buffet food was not great and not open for dinner was a bad idea please try to make a change for guest to not go out of ur casino for food
10,From the start the experience was bad. My company sent me here as an alternative to Mandalay Bay for a conference. Although it was called in and planned they wanted my personal card when I arrived to bill over $400! I told them this was a company trip and was paid for in advance. After giving them my personal card so i can check in they assured me it would be swapped before I checked out. After checking out I was billed another $300 on my personal card!    I called and nothing they can do the worst part is the service was subpar for my entire trip and I didn't complain once. I'm handicap and when I asked if the front desk could assist with a cane or chair I was only given rental information for a mobility scooter. No breakfast buffet was closed I thought this was a credible hotel?!    The luxor is next to mandalay Bay but the walk is horrible and hard to navigate.    Now after my trip the operator guy said he can't help me because I'm not a rewards member. I tell him that I am and he says they must not have added my trip to my account. What?!    My experience has been bad from the start and I wouldn't be able to recommend your hotel to a friend and I will make sure that others are aware of it as well.    Accidents happen miscommunication happens but every step of the way I've had an issue. I've stayed in hotels for half the price and had better communication and service.    Save your money and don't waste time with this hotel. Bad service is going to cost them. Save money by staying at another hotel than taking an uber or free shuttle to the hotel your convention is at.    Brandon
30,"Staff helpful and tables well managed. Would have been nice to know that the Las Vegas tram (monorail) was ""disconnected"" between MGM and all points south (Mandalay-Excalibur). Good shows and exhibits."
40,Stay away from Wyndham reps unless you want a guaranteed 2 hour presentation without your phones as they try to sell you a business that already has horrible reviews. It’s a great idea with a horrible execution.    The Luxor overall was a decent hotel.  The pyramid rooms on the 16th floor aren’t too slanted and are very spacious. Getting to the elevators though we’re somewhat difficult as it is a large hotel. The food was exceptional and the location was great for everything on the strip. It was an over all ok trip
40,Overall this was a good experience. Had some issues with the room but the hotel staff was friendly and promptly corrected the issues. All food and drinks at the hotel are very expensive. Prepare for that but everything in vegas is expensive.
50,Most of you who are booking a room at the Luxor is chasing value (like myself). We had a clean room and the staff was friendly. I recommend staying in one of the towers if you can and DEFINITELY download the MGM Rewards app for the mobile check in to save you some time. They have a kios that you can use to get physical keys if you want but you never have to wait in the long line at any point. The only down part is you're a little farther away from the action (hence the price) so just be prepared to walk. We'd gladly trade off the lower price for a little extra walking any day. Fitness room was clean & pool area was clean. 3 Starbucks on the property (2 open in the mornings). Food court has a sandwich place pizza Nathan's Johnny Rockets and an Asian place.
50,Everything about this vacation was amazing! The staff was amazing the food was incredible the view was unmatched! I will most definitely come back soon! My boyfriend and I had the time of our lives it was great! Thank you for the best experience ever in the city that never sleeps well except for me….I got some wonderful rest at the beautiful Luxor
50,Nothing is more romantic than soaking in a hot tub under a corner window sipping champagne and nibbling on chocolate covered strawberries. Friendly staff great room still out favorite. Call the concierge desk beforehand to order gift baskets and alcohol delivered to your room. Eat at the Diablo Cantina delicious!
30,Was there to celebrate 60th birthday! We did love the Mob Museum and the Shark Aquarium! But wish they had more things for older adults. We are tea drinkers. We couldn't find cold tea in or around the hotels at all.
20,Hotel was great the only problem I have is the homeless people walking around the hotel asking for money and digging through trash and what upset me the most there is a fountain in the lobby and a homeless climb in and was stealing the coins people threw in and the staff saw her and did nothing.
50,Went to Vegas for the NASCAR weekend and had a great stay at the Luxor! Service was great room was clean and a good size food was good and the bar staff were great as usual…they are very knowledgeable about Vegas
10,Absolutely no water my first afternoon never told why or reimbursed. No hot water except at 11pm. Pay extra to stay anywhere else.  Making me write over 200 characters so my review will submit. Gladly.  The one bright spot was seeing Black Adam. Please go see this if you're still reading 👍
10,1) Bluetooth room key stopped working after one hour - the app locked up - had to go in and stand inline to get hard keys  2) How water was non existent 75% of the week - barely lukewarm the rest of the time.  3) Water was 100% cutoff completely for 3 hours during a hot water main repair on 10/20 and just before dinner when we were trying to get ready for dinner. I went and looked at the repair in person - 30 year old copper piping is corroding and this is probably not the only time this happens. The plumber performing the repair was very nice to answer questions.  4) Front desk did not answer the phone ever during the week only once did operator answer.  5) Phone in room was falling apart in pieces really.  6) SPA was advertised as available this week but no one was there door was locked that was the one time the operator actually answered the phone and transferred us to a dead phone should have been easier for staff to be informed that there wasn't really any spa services available. We had a SPA down at Venetian far better for so many reasons.    All in all I give this hotel a solid 1 out of 10 and if this represents the MGM brand no chance of us returning to spend at MGM ever again. The only reason that LUXOR get a 1 instead of a ZERO is that the TENDER steakhouse and the BLUE MAN show was good. But neither of those are hotel staff related. This MGM branded hotel is focused on the bulk masses of corporate conferences and not the individual traveler.
10,I’ve been to Vegas dozens of times. I chose the Luxor this time because my work convention was at Mandalay but some of my coworkers couldn’t afford to stay there. Never again! I understand that you get what you pay for but honestly I wouldn’t have stayed here for free! Filthy. Moldy. Corroded bathroom fixtures. Housekeeping was a joke. We requested a new room and it was no better than the first. We were grossed out the ENTIRE time.
50,We decided to make our stay at the Luxor for a family member birthday. Our stay was very nice only problem was that luck was not on my side I couldn’t win for nothing. That was the only disappointment. Thank you
20,Room definitely needs a refresh… poor condition and dirty build-up. Room smelled moldy and was super humid/damp. A few good “housekeepers” went above and beyond when we complained… but could only do so much with what they have available to them.
50,Just need to upgrade your AC cuz rooms get hot and stuffy at night. Also maybe put some small refrigerator units in the room or some microwave because most places are closed at midnight. Other than that Great!!
20,I guess it is a good place if you’re just looking for a place to sleep. However the amount of hot water we had was low and the tv was not clear. We reported the hot water but unfortunately we werent able to get hot water for our last shower of the trip. Granted we also noticed at 0800 when checkout is 1100.
30,My non-smoking room became increasingly smoky over the course of three days. It seemed as if it the cigarette smoke was coming in through the air conditioning system. Had minor issues with the sink and shower. Two other work colleagues were on the same floor and had similar issues. Otherwise a relatively decent place to stay given the price. Staff member was extremely helpful and friendly with avoiding the long line and instructing a colleague and myself how to quickly utilize the mobile kiosk to check in. There were an adequate amount of places to eat within the hotel.
40,Although it was not perfect it did the job. I was very disappointed to have to use the same towel and that the tv didn’t work at all and when I asked nothing was done and we couldn’t even get clean towels being that my son had games all weekend we showered a lot
50,Definitely will be staying here again! Beautiful hotel inside with interesting exhibits and a good food court. I love that he has an inside connection to the Excalibur which then leads you to NYNY and you walk to MGM Grand and can catch the monorail 🚝
30,Price wise good cleaning wise ok  customer service good room service perfect  I seen many older people than younger people  you guys need to attract younger generations outside window advertising make room more darker
50,The team went above and beyond. They were so friendly accommodating and gave excellent service. Every time I asked for something they went above and beyond to provide that service. They provided service without expecting any tip. They honestly were super friendly!
50,My room is always clean when I arrive. Staff is always very courteous and helpful. Housekeeping is always good. I left an irreplaceable sentimental item behind. They made it painless to retrieve the item and shipped it out to me right away.
40,Overall staff was ok nothing special. Kept getting stopped for vouchers. The bathroom had used soap in the shower and house keeping didn't change sheets just made the bed. Price wasn't terrible. Alot of our shows were at other hotels so it was a bit of a walk to get from them from this particular hotel.
20,Bathrooms are falling apart AC didn’t cool the space properly and my room was not clean when I checked in. Dirty floors and dust all over the lamps/tables. Non smoking room smelled like marijuana and cigarettes
40,Stayed in the East tower for convention. Room was decent for the price. Window looked out to Rideshare area which was blaring music seemingly 24/7. Colleague stayed in the pyramid and had a much nice view inside and out would definitely not stay in a tower next time.
10,The hotel started off decently. I went to my room and they smelled like stale smoke. The entire property franky smelled horribly. During the first night I woke up to water splashing on my bathroom floor from the ceiling above. No replacement room was offered. No anything was offered. It took 2 hours to fix with maintenance. I had a colleague who had someone enter their room in the middle of the night with a key card. Yikes.    The gym is poor. Old equipment and crowded. Needs to be bigger. Food options were poor.    Housekeeping did a great job.
50,Super clean and close to the strip. Online check in was extremely easy. Had to have front desk assistant because of a problem and they were nothing but helpful and kind. Will definitely stay again in the future.
50,I have a nice stay I enjoyed the luxor and Mandalay Bay. My room in the West Tower was nice. I will be back there again next month. Martin was amazing and took very good care of us I appreciate him..
10,"Went out for a walk. During my reservation I refused housekeeping services and on that day I placed the ""Don't disturb"" sign outside on the door handle. After came back found my room door unlocked and open so anyone could sneak in and steal my stuff. The ""Don't disturb"" sign was replaced inside on the back handle. Unacceptable accident."
20,The location of the hotel is far from the central strip and nothing really around the hotels to hang out or do. The bed was clean but other than that the hotel looks and feels old overall outdated. Shows in the hotel needs much more work and nothing was lively how Las Vegas is supposed to be.
10,Room’s are very old nothing has been updated. Very dirty floors windows and restrooms with flies. There was a bad smell as soon as you enter the room. Only good thing about this hotel is the titanic museum.
40,We stayed at the Luxor before that's why we went back. The room was dirty no hot water one morning we requested additional towels numerous times (had to use some to cover the chairs) and never received them. Won't stay there again very sad because the time before over overly exceptional
10,the Hotel had to be the dirtiest I have every stayed in I called the front desk multiple times and no one answered them when they did answer they told me to I had to come down to the front desk nobody wanted to do anything the bathroom was never cleaned from the previous Guest the room was so dirty I couldn’t sleep in it I left at 6:30 in the morning just to get out of the hotel definitely would not recommend it to anybody
20,The expensive “higher-end” room was very outdated. The mattress was sunk in on one side. The shower drain was clogged and it took two calls and 10 hours for someone to coke clear it. What a huge expensive disappointment.
20,When the app doesn't work and you have to stand in a huge line that kind of starts it off in the wrong direction. 'Must be too many users she said'. Then we buy late checkout (price changed 3 times in 3 hours). On our last day we were woken up early as we had 'already checked out'. We did not! We had to tell them we had late checkout.
40,Prior to our stay I read some bad reviews; was not nearly as bad as what the reviews said; nice staff not always very helpful but very friendly and professional; Hotel is dated was Happy to Stay at this ICON of a Hotel I do Prefer other MGM properties
30,Cold showers and need reno ...plus air conditioner didnt work ...staff are great at front desk ..casino was good but dirty ... buffet wasnt open when it stated online that it was ...expensive dining restaurants there
50,Great place to stay - Beds are super comfortable. We really enjoyed our stay; this was our first time at the Luxor. Saw Carrot Top while we were there and he was super funny. The staff was very friendly.
10,The Hotel and room felt very old/outdated and just in very poor condition. We did not have hot water in our shower's whether we took one in the morning or evening The pillows were horrible it was easier to sleep without the pillows.
20,Over priced!!!!! Needs luxury upgraded since charging luxury prices. AC went out and all I got was $100 off night stay for each night. Mind u I was sweating. I feel more accomodation should have been made
40,We had a ground floor room which starteled me but not having to ride an elevator was a plus in hindsight. View of the Spynx was pretty sweet and the pool was not too crowded. We enjoyed the Titanic exhibit Sportsbook and some snacks on site. Location is convenient to walk to other venues.
30,Somebody crapped in a sink outside the casino floor. Somebody wading in the fountain grabbing coins. No fridge in our hotel room. I’m the late AM casino tables were few and under staffed. Probably not going to stay again.
50,Absolutely loved it! Couldn’t have been a cooler experience! The MGM rewards desk was super helpful and turned out to be more than beneficial. I received several $20 off meals at different restaurants in the Luxor as well as a couple free plays.
50,Over all good experience I would recommend Luxor to anyone looking for a fair priced casino/hotel to stay at clean all around and the remodeled tower has great rooms clean comfortable beds restrooms are good casino floor is nice and clean too with friendly staff
10,The rooms needs to be clean very dusty and bad smell. Staff was nice. Furniture in the room need to be thrown away and replaced. Smoking made my experience not good. It’s was suppose to be a non smoking area
40,This is a nice upscale budget hotel. If you are looking to stay for cheap and want a good location than this hotel is the one for you. Only cons are the cold showers in the morning and the pressure is so high that the drain can't keep up. Other con is beds are budget beds as this is a budget upscale hotel. Casino cons are homeless freely walking around collecting the cash out tickets that people didn't retrieve from machine. There are also prostitutes in the casino.
30,It's a good cheap option to choose if you have a convention at Mandalay. The rooms are tired and the entire place is always dark. Not many food options there so thankfully its connected to Mandalay and Excaliber. Blue Man and Carrot Top are pretty good shows there.
40,Not a bad hotel! There is a free tram that takes you right to the main strip which runs every few minutes. Everything was clean and the room was pretty clean. We stayed in the tower. We didn't really hang out at the hotel itself at all so can't rate food or gambling here.
30,Came here for 4 nights in October . Mixed results . It's massive inside  all Egyptian themed . Which is good . But it's always in semi darkness and a little to cold in there . Rooms are large and got air con but a little dated . Clean thou . Two large double beds in all the rooms and a nice table . Iron and ironing board and hair dryer . Not really any ward robes thou . So lived out of the suitcase . Also if you suffer from vertigo definatly dont stop here . All the rooms doors open out onto corridors with low walls and we were on the 20th floor . Not for the faint hearted . Easy access to other hotels via connected corridors that are full of shops restaurants etc . So yy don't need to go outside to get around or there is a free metro that runs along the hotels aswell . After visiting all the other hotels in the strip we decided ours was the worst . ( personnel opinion I know) . Also be prepared to spend money ! Vegas is very dear . Average beer is between £8 to £12 a pint .. average meal between £13 to £30 a meal . So in conclusion Luxor is ok no problems really . Just looked dated . But hay it's in vegas so enjoy .
40,The luxor has nice rooms and a nice pool. It is also very affordable and is the reason we stayed there when our conference was held at Mandalay Bay. I loved that there was a starbucks so close to our room. The workout room was a little small and cramped for a hotel this size but it worked. I don't love the location of this hotel but overall it is a nice hotel. My biggest complaint is how dark the rooms are in the west tower.
20,Room key didn’t work. Several staff members seemed rude or inconvenience when asked for something. The pool was amazing. And definitely the highlight of the hotel. I probably won’t stay there again. I was disappointed I was really looking forward to staying there. Unfortunately that probably won’t happen again.
20,Day one Monday at Luxor  First room was not clean had water stains on floor and what looked to be water/pee stains around the toilet.    The moved is rooms from the 6th floor to the tenth floor.    The second room (replacement room) only had2 pillows on each bed our other room has four each as shown in the rooms photos on the website when we asked for 2 additional pillows each bed they only brought us one up.    We had to request towels for Tuesday.    Tuesday went well came back to came back to a clean room beds made.    Wednesday we left the room around 9:30 when we got back we noticed the beds were not made and that the room had not been touched. We called housekeeping at 4:30pm to ask for the room to be cleaned and for new towels so we could shower but it wasn’t cleaned and we didn’t get new towels by the time we got back again at 11:20pm! So we called again and this time we got Lashae who said she would send someone up.  We just want to soak and go to bed but here it is almost 12am and our room just  Got cleaned.  (The cleaning ladies were super sweet and did a great job even at 12am!)    We are here til Saturday so we’ll see how the rest of the days go….so far we’re not impressed. We shouldn’t have arrived to a messy room at check in on Monday nor should they have skipped cleaning the room on Wednesday.
10,First off this hotel is nasty! Smells of weed all through the hotel. Smells of cigarette smoke everywhere. The casino staff harass you to do their stupid time share crap every single time you walk down in the lobby. They don't take no for an answer so irritating. The parking rates are outrageous and the resort fee on top of that! The room we stayed in didn't have a fridge or a microwave making it impossible to keep drinks cold or even have meals in tour room. The pool was huge but they only had 1 part of it open so wvwryone was on top of each other. The pool are smelled of weed and just stunk in general. The carpet in the hotel is coming up I tripped countless times walking from my room to the elevator because the carpet is coming up. The hotel is just nasty I would never stay here again!
50,Great stay. Walking distance to Mandalay Bay Pool and Conference Centers were amazing. The restaurants shops and show within the hotel is fantastic. The casinos are a great attraction as well. The staff was friendly and the room was clean and comrfotable.
20,No Wifi TV movies or room service. Bed was lumpy and uncomfortable which made it difficult to sleep. Music outside all night kept me up. Service in Mexican restaurant was terrible. Food was just ok.
20,Peeling wallpaper in the halls. Casino smells like an old lady’s house that owns too many cats. Homeless people all over the place near the Uber pick up. Do better. The room was fine but you can get far better with other Hotels in Vegas for her price.
30,I was ready and excited at first to be there and check in when a lady named Mari with short black hair refused to check me in when my husband was just parking the car. I showed her my ID with my last name which is NOT a common last name (Pisha) and she said that he had to be present so she can check that the reservation name and address matched. I told her to look at my ID at least to corroborate it’s the exact same one on the reservation and she refused. I couldn’t believe I just got to the hotel and I experienced awful customer service first hand and in too of that have to stay for a week. My thought at that moment was -Never again!!!    The lady made me get out of the line and re make the line until my husband could check in.    Lastly during the stay we had to call to get the room serviced the carpets in the room common areas were worn out and dirty. It looks like they need to do better at cleaning them.
50,Really nice stay. Lots to do and everyone very friendly. From check in to check out your hotel did everything right. Couldn’t ask for a more clean friendly hotel. Thanks for the great stay and will be coming back soon.
40,Don't let the staff trick you into going to a presentation cause you'll waste at least 3 hrs of your day getting convinced to buy into a time share. Yes they offer discounted tickets to any show but I personally don't think it's worth it especially cause they run your credit and sign you up for a credit card without properly explaining what they're actually doing.Once I denied the timeshare I felt like we were treated in a hostile manner.
30,Good location if you're there for a conference/convention. Great value for money. Not a lot of food and beverage options and what is available is quite expensive but that is typical of The Strip no matter where you stay. Check-in/check-out was quite easy. Rooms a bit dated but clean.
10,The room had a smell the sheets were stained the duvet was nasty the plug didn't work they were out of hand towels at check in so i had to wait for clean ones Never Again will I stay here a waste of 350.00
50,Very great experience from check-in to check-out MGM and the Luxor provided a very memorable stay! We started with a complementary early check in as well as a clean room to relax in after our journey then we were greeted by hotel staff and were provided great deals on some awesome shows and exhibitions! We will definitely be returning soon!
20,Hotel room was updated but elevators were not clean and need refreshed as well as Casino. Casino public bathroom was in horrible condition dirty and needs updating. This hotel was in need of SERIOUS updating and care. Will not stay at Luxor again. Even pool area was dated and not refreshed...a disappointment for sure.
20,"Shower door was not secured and almost fell on me (maintenance person was amazing though). Room A/C kept dropping to 62 every night and we tried everything to override it.  There was no hot water multiple times during our stay (unacceptable)  We ended up having to extend rather than pack up and leave but the room rate was ridiculous. (We also had a food credit that was not transferred over I don't think?) When I called to ask the woman said ""sorry they don't transfer"" So when we extended they should have told us to use the credit or loose it.    We did not receive room service 2 of the days we stayed there. :(    TV was horribly complicated and fuzzy and the fact that there was no ability for in room dining after a long day of conference meetings was HIGHLY disappointing."
20,"We had no hot water for our morning shower. I called the front desk. Their solution "" You can go to the spa and see if you can use their showers"" Really? Like we want to travel thru the casino with our toiletries to take a shower. What a joke"
10,I was not impressed with my stay for the very first time being in Las Vegas. I paid extra to have an upgrade and then I find out three days later on YouTube the upgrade I was not promised us of the money that I spent for this trip for being the first time it was not worth the time nor the money. I thought the staff was very not informative about what was going on when they told me about the upgrade she rushed me to the service and upgraded me at $10 a night there was no fridge and there was no coffee maker or a seat for the money that I had to bring down. I would not recommend this for a hotel unless you have a Lotta Lotta money that you love the waist high unfortunately and my son did not have a lot of money to waste but we felt like we were taken advantage of because we were new to Las Vegas so with that being said I wrote corporate and email explain more detail .
50,Loved my stay. Wish the resort had perks such as drink and food vouchers. Overall I had a blast. I don’t have anything else to say but it says I need a minimum of two hundred words. Thanks again for everything
40,The room was somewhat dated and worn. The carpet had puckers in it and the furniture was scratched up and wobbly. The bathroom sink faucets were hard to turn. The bed was reasonably comfortable. The resort fee was $75 for that they don’t even offer a secure Wifi connection so what’s the $75 for other than money in their pocket. The American flag out front was tattered and shredded disgraceful. I informed an employee who wrote it down.
40,The resort is very clean and in a safe area. Plenty of places to enjoy gaming and eating. Rooms are clean and beds very soft. All of the bartenders were very nice with the exception of one. I don't recall his name but he was at the flight bar. Overall had an amazing experience and will definitely go back. Thank you luxor .
50,Got a lot of comps won some money seen some shows. The rooms are amazing. I love how you can’t hear the music from the main part of the hotel. Fast check in and check out. Suggest getting the MGM rewards and app.
50,Was super clean and friendly place amazing time amazing drinks good prices food was bomb big bright amazing thing to see super friendly staff super hopefully with anything u need cleaning floors and all
10,when I checked in they were overbooked so I was downgraded to a pyramid with no discount or comps included. The tower and pyramid room's quality is night and day different. the room had dust or was dirty on almost all surfaces and I was offered cold showers 4 days I was there. Overall 1/10
40,Luxor is conveniently located rooms were clean and even though there was a long line for check in it moved really fast. The guest service representative was very helpful she went above and beyond to ensure me and my sister’s rooms were next to each other.
10,The rooms were very dirty stains on walls that never got cleaned stains on the bed sheets and pillows. Smell in halls that were unbearable. We came to find out the health inspectors were there due to pipes breaking and were there all weekend should have told their customers and moved them all to mgm grand.
30,If you can overlook damage and other public area maintenance issues this is a cool hotel. The elevator reminds me of a Harry Potter movie. I felt safe but it’s not for the faint hearted. Great staff and neat hotel considering the pyramid design and decor.
20,"I visited August 2021.  I brought my fiancé here for the first time and he was disappointed. I upgraded to a suite because I booked a comp king room and I understand the room types are based on availability. My fiancé is 6'8"" and those small two beds weren't going to cut it. The suite had a king bed and I paid more. The hallway carpet looked filthy appeared to be permanent stains on the tile and the elevator had missing buttons and it was also dirty. The room has potential however but the furniture looked worn and dated. I should of contacted front desk about these issues; the TV did not work in the bedroom and we watched the TV in the living room from the bedroom since it was literally within eyeshot from the bed. Second day we were there I found 3 small roaches crawling on the living room table near the sink. It was late at night and I did not feel like room changing. My fiancé having a bad experience he doesn't want to visit again. I used to love Luxor and have stayed here plenty of times before but it has dropped the ball. Luxor isn't an expensive hotel but sheesh cleanliness shouldn't be neglected. Not to mention the sketchy guy in the hallway in the morning basically begging me to buy a used blunt off of him when all I wanted to do was buy a drink at the vending machine!"
50,We had a wonderful time. The staff was helpful and the rooms were very nice. Unfortunately we stayed in a wing and would have preferred one in the pyramid but other than that top notch service. Love the phone app btw
10,If you are looking for a dark hotel with old amenities and poorly informed staff you got the right hotel. I felt like I was running a 5K to get to the elevators from our room and then had to wait forever to get an elevator. Dirty sheets outlets that didn't work and poor plumbing all describe the poor experience during my stay.
10,Outdated decor no amenities broken elevator slow housekeeping  Also housekeeping opened my door and let herself in without permission to ask me if I need additional assistance my first morning there.  Then upon telling her there were no face towels they weren’t delivered until late that evening -
10,My wife and I came to town the catch the NASCAR race as part of a package deal. We had reserved a king standard and instead was given a handicap room. The mattress was terrible and the bathroom had issues.
50,Stayed recently to celebrate my birthday and see Notre Dame play at Allegiant Stadium. My MGM host Britany Blackwell made reservations for our group and everything was perfect as usual. A beautiful suite on the top floor of the East tower. Housekeeping kept everything immaculate. We also booked a cabana at the pool. Miguel Andre and the rest of the pool staff made it a very special day. Can't thank them enough. Getting to the stadium for the game was easy. All and all a terrific time. Going back again in December! Thank you MGM and Luxor for everything!
30,I stayed here because I had a convention at the Mandalay Bay and didn't want to pay their prices. It was nice that it is connected so I didn't have to drive to the convention center. There are plenty of restaurants but there was smoking around the Starbucks and the dessert place. The walls and windows allow all sounds to come through. I heard helicopters through the evening (tourist activity?) every evening. I heard my next door neighbor's laugh alarm blow dryer etc. Any time someone walks down the hall talking it can be heard. I wouldn't stay here again.
50,"Couldn't be happier with our stay. Rooms neat and clean. Wonderful staff everyone was very friendly and helpful. Although I've heard others say that the Luxor was ""getting old"" we visited several other hotels / casinos but when we planned our next trip to Las Vegas there was no doubt where we wanted to stay and already made reservations for our return stay at The Luxor."
10,We stayed for a whole week because my wife was at a Convention in Mandaly Bay. It was our first time staying at an MGM Resort Facility and maybe it will be our last. First I will start with the dust in our room at the Tower ( it was all over the room). MGM needs urgently to make some renovations to the hotel and be sure that housekeeping and maintenance keep this hotel at 4-star rate standards not a 1. $35.00 for Resort Fees that include (Wifi and Facilities) Wifi is spotty and always down and the pool is always crowded and they charge additional for a chair etccc..
10,This hotel is very much past it’s prime smells of cigarette smoke in every corner and staff seems generally bothered. There is really nothing redeeming about the experience…quite the contrary! Check-in staff was rude wires exposed in elevator trash in public areas.
10,Upon checkin the hotel was old didn't have many amenitities and the rooms for disabled folks (I am a double amputee) were so far from the lobby that it was horrible to try and get to. Beyond that the room smelled horribly of marijuana and they couldn't clean the smell out. They also couldn't move me to a different room so I was stuck with this horrible room. Room seemed clean but it smelled horribly gave me a headache and beyond that was very old. The bathroom wasn't very accessible ie the sink was poorly designed for a wheelchair user and the shower leaked water around the entire bathroom each time. The location wasn't very good its far from most of the action and the monorails from this hotel to next door hotel didn't work which meant it was difficult for a disabled person to access the rest of the strip.
50,Very helpful staff rooms are clean casino is great dinner choices are excellent. Being able to jump to Excalibur or Mandalay Bay was convenient. I recommend staying here if your traveling with your family
40,We stayed in a 2 BR deluxe suite which was decently appointed however the walls and carpets are showing wear and tear. The staff was very friendly. I was not awarded my free play which was to be a part of my package and when I asked the casino about it they told me I had none. Very disappointed. I prefer to stay at this end of the strip as it is not as crowded. The new MGM rewards program is disappointing to say the least. It is more difficult to maintain current status and definitely difficult to elevate to the next status. I will be checking in to the other programs.
10,This is one of the worse hotels I’ve ever stayed at. It is said to be haunted but I didn’t experience any paranormal activity. Hotel is dark gloomy & dirty. In dire need of renovations. Our room overlooked a rooftop. The walk paper in the hallway was falling off. They started repairing during our stay. So there was a construction zone right outside of our door. Woulda been nice if they had given us a heads up or comped at least one night. That area of the hotel should’ve been closed. Stay away
50,The pillows are the fluffiest I ever felt. Room was clean. Casino was clean and fun. Structure of the lynx was so cool. I was able to check in early and checkout late. Comfortable bed. Super clean and fancy
30,I guess I expected more for the money. What has happened to customer service? No doorman or valet. No help getting luggage in the building and finding the reception desk. Uber doesn't drop off in the front so you struggle getting in and to the reception desk
10,Sadly the reputation is true. I was naive to give this property an opportunity comma especially since we usually stay at the Aria. The staff does not care about the customer or pride in work. Save time.
10,Just recently stayed at the Luxor which was the worst stay I’ve had in Vegas. No warm water for showers rooms had mold on ceilings room service didn’t work nor did anyone help fix our issue. I definitely won’t be staying here at the Luxor again especially due to not one employee trying to help us.
30,Stayed at the Luxor for a conference. They overbooked rooms so part of our party had to stay in a downgraded room which were subpar. The elevators for the downgraded section of the hotels were slow which impacted us to get to our conference on time.
20,Perfect place to stay if you enjoy the smell of raw sewage and prefer cold showers. Elevators look like they are being held together with duck tape. Sad to say but it’s time to tear down the Luxor. RIP
10,Very bad experience made me never to choose staying at Luxor again.  1. Bad check-in experience. The front desk stuff is not friendly and the rooms was not ready when we had been told ready and given with the key  2. Bad staying experience the room furnishings are very old and toilet seat is broken.  3. In the morning of check out date around 10:00am the shower water is cold could not get it warmer than body temperature
50,We had a great recent stay at Luxor. Staff were friendly and professional. Housekeeping really went the extra mile to make us feel welcomed. There was ample dining and gaming options and room was clean and comfortable. We really could not have asked for anything more.
50,Excellent stay. While some public areas show a bit of wear and tear Pyramids rooms were excellent. All staff members we encountered were excellent. Not sure we why people complain. Hotel was great for us. Check in line was short.
20,I was guest on October 13 I was charged a fee online when I checked in I had to pay resort fee of 200 which was not a problem our house keeper did not change my sheets I had to ask for extra towels and I was charged 345 for no reason lstill haven't been refunded
40,Average room that was clean and very comfortable. AC and shower work well. Wish it had a refrigerator and a coffee pot. The bathroom vent fan comes on with the light and is very noisy. That was obnoxious.  The hotel has a major problem. When you are on the walkways outside of the rooms you look down onto the tops of buildings. All of them are filthy dirty and covered with trash. Some of that trash looks like it’s been there for years. Really looks horrible.
30,Ignore the dust in the place they removed the refrigerator from. Ignore the trash that is visible from the walkways on top of the interior buildings. Good luck following the signage to locate shows or the pool.
10,Hotel has aged badly and needs major updating. Rooms are dingy and outdated and overall facility shows deferred maintenance. Colleague had laptop stolen by housekeeping. Avoid if you want to enjoy LV.
40,I paid for a reservation for a King room. When we got there they switched us to a double queen. When I went to go back and get the King room I paid for they said it was no longer available and “upgraded” me at a cost to me of an additional $200. The large windows you can hear EVERYTHING outside yet you barely get service (the group we were with- we could never get texts to go through to). The air in our “paid for upgraded room” whistled when it was on.
30,Issue with check in and staff- however other staff was accommodating. 1st room was horrible- 2 nd room acceptable. Missed a large portion of day 1 sessions due to this issue. Walking distance to convention was 1 mile- not convenient at all.
40,"Not a bad hotel. If you are looking for something a little more upscale you should look at other options. We were told that the West Towers were upgraded unlike the East Towers. We ended up staying 1 night in the West Towers and the rest of our stay in the East Towers due to a really bad ""weed"" smell in the room. The room was nice but I could not live with the smell. We actually thought the East Towers were better. Overall not a bad place to stay."
10,Room had an awful cigarette smell. Mentioned it to the front desk to which they offered to spay the room which would have made it worse. Lots of availability they should have offered us a new room. Also the hallway had a pungent smell
30,Rooms are very old (we were staying in the pyramid) but cost the same S much swankier and cleaner Delano. Layout is confusing. The entrance and theme is cool but try finding your elevator to your room!
50,I stayed here for a Training & Conference I was attending. The employees of the hotel were so nice and helpful. My room was clean & everything in working order. I wish some of the other guests had been as considerate as the staff but I guess it IS Vegas so I can't expect all of the guests to be quiet and pleasant all the time. Overall I really had a great time.
50,Very clean so close to Allegiant Stadium and excellent location to nearby casinos! Really enjoyed the staff and the Public House. Food was excellent! Location on the strip was so clean with plenty of access to each casino.
30,Overall not a bad stay but it is very dated and filter system may need replaced. The entire casino and first floor smelled awful to the point your eyes sting and water. The smoke smell is so overwhelming you need to shower multiple times a day to feel clean. Even with that turn off I did still enjoy my stay I just spent most my time in other casinos.
40,Although it certainly is not new the rooms were nice and the gaming was fun. Definitely could use some additional restaurants though. Parking fees for guests staying at the resort on top of resort fees and room fees seemed excessive. Parking fees should be for people not staying at the resort. Also only one of the swimming pools was open for swimming and was a bit crowded.
10,Checkin clerk was very rude. Asked to be near an elevator and ended up the other side of the hotel. Far away from one. Hotel was filthy with peeling wallpaper and paint. No towels. Dirty hotel room. Never again!!!
10,The hotel is pushing digital check ins. This process was horrible. I walked around the hotel for an hour going back and forth trying to get the room key to work. When I finally got to my room it was hot smelled like cigarettes had a loud fan blowing outside the room the entire time. I feel like the staff knew there was an issue with my room and instead of being proactive waited and hoped that I would complain. I never even got a chance. I had to leave early and their cancellation policy is horrible! You have to pay for your entire stay even if you have to leave. 100% would not recommend.
10,This hotel is old dated borderline dirty. Hands down the worst smelling hotel in Vegas and the rooms all smell like smoke the entire trip. The elevators need constant maintenance. The staff is definitely the most rude and under trained staff I have ever experienced in Vegas. Asking for simple directions seems to be a chore to everyone you encounter if you can get them to even respond to you. Most of them just stare at you and point like a bunch of mindless drones. The dealers in the casino are just flat out rude if they talk to you at all.
40,Good place to visit stay. Check in was quick and easy. Parking Valet service was exceptional. Room and bathroom were both clean tho bout are badly in need of an update/upgrade/refresh. Shower floor was very slippery so much that a bath towel was available to place in the shower floor. No USB ports. No I’m room coffee. TV had some volume problems. Overall 9 out of 10.
10,Old dark and dreary. Most unfriendly staff. Overpriced to start and then you pay a resort fee and if you want to use the pool and have shade it's $125. On top of that the drinks are watered down. I suggest staying anywhere but here.
10,I truly wish I could give the Luxor hotel a 0 star. I stayed for an entire week for a work conference next door at the Mandalay Bay. My friend and I had multiple things STOLEN from our room- including laptops expensive clothing items camera equipment and much more.    We left the room for a few hours to attend a work meeting and came back to a clean room somewhat. The housekeeping not only made the beds but made off with my things.    The rooms don’t even have a fridge. The TVs are from the early 00s. And the service sucks.    The “company policy” is to only reimburse the resort fee when incidents like this happen as if $35 x 7 replaces the thousands of dollars worth of merchandise stolen.    I will never stay here again and ENSURE my entire company (6k attendees all together) never come here to get stolen from and treated poorly while paying a premium for a glorified Motel 6. I recommend staying elsewhere unless you are staying here for FREE and even then - bring a safe.    The safe provided barely fits one purse in it.
30,The hotel is visually awesome. But I payed almost $500 a night and the room was not impressive. It was old outdated and had an extra lounge room that was so small and awkward it served no purpose at all. Also the shower door was broken and almost falling off. And the walls were so thin you could hear your neighbors fart.  Overall it was a good experience but only because it was Vegas and we spent very little time in the room. The rest of the hotel was amazing..
10,First room I got smells like sewage switched to a new room and found a roach. Water temperatures are wild… never warm or hot enough in the AM (likely because most guests are showering) PM showers the water temperatures are burning hot (even when you turn it all the way to cold). Elevators are old and the key card reader takes multiple tries.
10,Service sucks  rooms are gross and staff never were helpful ! Had an event in on of their special rooms and the staff had no clue where it was ! A guests dog peed on the floor and 20 minutes later still not cleaned up
20,The casino was way too smokey and old looking. The rooms were dark so they didn't look clean. Needs a definite remodel. I stayed the weekend in a suite and was not impressed at all. dark and dingy - not even a bottle of water. I moved to a regular room and it was better
50,I would highly recommend staying at the Luxor. They provide excellent service; rooms are spotless; have several tasty restaurants and offer excellent entertainment such as: the Titanic Exhibit; The Body Exhibition; The King Tut Exhibit; not to mention the Blue Man Group + you can go on a helicopter ride and really see Las Vegas! Maybe I'll do that someday....
40,First time staying at Luxor. I had been hesitant to stay here after reading more than a few unfavorable reviews. I was pleasantly surprised. Great location friendly staff clean room. We really enjoyed the Fantasy Show.
10,Save your frustration and find a venue that offers more value options customer service and spends the money to keep their facility clean and updated.  There are not any real amenities offered- for example- there is a lovely pool but you do not have any access to shade or a pool umbrella unless you pay for it. Really? That should be a standard offering.  It feels like the owners of this hotel are just squeezing revenue from the property and not reinvesting in it.
20,Parking valet monorail other casinos general signage is awful. Most of the casinos are this way it seems. However if you are going to cut staff or hire fewer then you need to increase the budgets for signage on how to travel about on and around the strip. Further when there is a game at this ill-planned stadium why in the heck would you penalize the people that are staying at your hotel by blocking access to their vehicle or the parking structure? Why not explain it to us upon check-in? Why not have a posting in the room explaining some additional logistics?
50,We had a great experience at rhe Luxor. The Notre Dame Shamrock Series game was that weekend and the location was perfect. Check-in was fast and easy. The service was terrific. Our room in the Tower was clean and comfortable. I definitely recommend the Luxor.
10,From the air traffic noise and rubbish tech to the stale sandwiches and soap that removes ALL liquid from not just your body but your soul this place needs to be knocked down and rebuilt. It’s VERY tired. Even the Golden Nugget is newer!!!
20,I can look past chipped furniture or peeling wall paper for the location but what I can’t understand is how you wouldn’t try counteract the age with some standard amenities.. ie: a refrigerator a clock a pen and note card a iron etc. the room
20,Inexpensive but in need of a refresh light fixture dangling from ceiling by its cord. Windows we’re dirty. No hot water in the morning for a shower. Elevators were all banged up and the small service panels were kicked in.
40,The overall stay was great only two minor issues no fridge in the rooms and the A/C blows on the bed which makes it a little uncomfortable to sleep. Was able  To turn vents but slightly difficult due to the paint on them. Maybe update the a/c or provide a way to divert the a/c from the bed
50,I thought the the place w a nice. I wish there was a mini fridges in the rooms. I stayed in two different rooms. Both rooms were clean. I’ve always stayed at the Luxor. I’m a big fan of the south side of the strip. I will be back again soon.
30,"I enjoyed my stay BUT there were definitely some issues. I tried the app check-in which said it worked but didn't give me a key so I had to wait in line anyway. The first room was right on the casino floor - not at all safe for a women traveling alone. No security or anything to keep any casino visitor from knocking on your door or seeing that a woman went into the room alone. The room had zero internet service no window at all and no WiFi coverage (take this out of service Luxor until you can get this fixed). The deal-breaker though was that the room was not even slightly clean. Hair on the counter and toilet beds turned down and a used hand-towel. I think someone else had checked in didn't like the room the moved and nobody checked to clean up after those guests. I called ""0"" and the lady said they'd send housekeeping because they ""had no other rooms"" and they would NOT move me - she was emphatic. But after 30 minutes of standing around waiting (because who even wants to sit on a dirty bed) no housekeeper showed up so I trekked back to the front desk dragging my luggage and arrived very unhappy. I asked for a manager but was given another agent but at least I didn't have to wait another 30 minutes in line. They didn't have anything in the pyramid so I got sent to the East tower. This room was clean and nice if worn out they said it was an ""upgrade"" it had a bathtub which I enjoyed having. I had to sent out for TP the 2nd night I was left with a 1/4 roll and no spare. The TV service was intermittent like it was on Wifi and worked sometimes but not others. I called and waited for a tech but then gave up and went to bed. TV service was intermittent during my entire stay. Not a plus.    I enjoyed the Diablo Restaurant and the Public House bar and had a good cocktail at the main level bar name unknown.    I checked out via the QR code on the TV but again technology was not my friend. It said I was checked out but I never received an emailed receipt after 20 hours and will have to call them to get the receipt. Trying the app it said I was already checked out but again no access to a receipt. If you're going to have apps and automatic systems Luxor they need to work otherwise they're worse than nothing.    Would I stay again? I'm not sure. The price was right and I saved money over the conference hotel but the systems were frustrating. My second room was nice but that shouldn't have needed to"
20,The Luxor is an older property and it shows. The entire property needs an update. The thing that grossed me out was that it was dirty. The elevator area and view walking to the room was dirty. I had a toe nail in my room and it didn't belong to me. It's cheap so if you are OK with old and dirty then it's perfect for you.
20,Really hard to get you room serviced .. had to chase someone down after not being cleaned for 2 days .. also spent $200 in cantina restaurant.. food was terrible .. I feel like Mexican food shouldn’t be that hard NOR that expensive .. I don’t mind paying a bunch of money for food but it needs to be good !
50,Overall fantastic time at the Luxor Hotel Resort & Casino.....I was able to relax with a drink (or two) daily at the beautiful and soothing swimming pools....the Casino was extremely fun and the sheer size of the building made it super easy to move around despite the traffi inside.....I am a big Sports guy so i spent alot of time laying down some Pro and College Football Wagers where I was also able to recieve some free drink comp tickets....The Room was incredible too and provided me with all the necessities i need to relax and rejuvinate myself for the next day....like most of the Casinos on the strip.....Luxor provides some great Shows and Restuarants so I would absolutely reccommend this Casino as you will be extremely impressed by not just the attributes but also the great price.
30,The hotel was just ok. I pre-paid for self park but the lot was full. I was told the valet parking fees would be taken care of. Not the case. The elevator situation is too crazy. The wait times were very long.
10,Air conditioners don't work properly and you sleep hot. Tub drained very slow. Friends had a water leak in one and a room broken into in another. When we complained about our room they were annoyed. The place is very dingy and frankly I would recommend spending a bit more staying at another hotel for a better Vegas experience.
20,"Check in queue was long and my partner was made to wait apart from me to try trimming the volume of the line but once at the counter the experience was fine. One guest was openly complaining over the number of check-in stations that were not staffed but anyone who's been to Walmart knows about that experience.  Staff interactions were superb. They were always helpful and friendly. The room cleaners seemed professional and effective.    We enjoyed the view from the room and it was what I expected from the Luxor.  The bed did not feel especially comfortable compared to other places we've stayed but was clean and well dressed/made.  Perhaps it's my fault for not checking before booking but we were underwhelmed at the lack of a refrigerator or coffe maker/anything that can heat water. It didn't ruin our trip but something to consider if you like to do more in your room for meals.  I also expected more things to be open 24hrs. It'd be nice if you spent all day traveling crash and wake at an odd hour. To be fair they do have an in hotel 24hr minimart.  I just feel so much magic has been lost since my first visit in the early 90s. Very sad to see multiple adverts across several faces of the once glorious pyramid.  We enjoyed the gallery spaces of the Bodies exhibit and they are on par with other world renowned museums.  That said given the choice between Luxor and a similar priced venue I will likely choose the other. It was my partner's first time in Las Vegas and I thought this would be one of the most unique hotels to stay in. She is very modest and does not keep especially high expectations yet she was not at all ""wowed"" the way I hoped. It really just made me sad to see these huge attraction hotels dim and be bought out by each other to drag along a few more years.  I have family out here and have been visiting every few years for 3/4 of my life and the vibe is just different now.    Objectively: It's a pyramid hotel. The view may be great from your unit. It was one of the more affordable on-Strip sites I found. You will have a place to sleep and cordial staff to help you with any questions. Prime location for Strip-goers."
30,Everything was great other than the fact that the staff saw my dog and most people had an attitude with me or did not want to help me get what I needed. Glad for self check in through the app though. Don’t prepay for parking tho it was a Gaston to get that through so I ended up paying twice and no reimbursement. Hotel itself was nice couldn’t hear neighbors. But first time there it’s very confusing and again the staff does not like to help. Probably due to understaffing
50,Family vacation. Good value and a nice place to stay. Staff was friendly. Several restaurants to pick from. Slept great. Easy self parking and super convenient to the rental car return and the airport.
10,Sink wouldn't drain. Keys failed multiple times. Long lines at desk just to be able to get in my room after long day at conference. Shower drain popped off. Hotel very dirty. Wall overlooking hotel floor was rickety and seemed unsafe.
50,Great staff clean rooms good casino games close to the MGM free tram and other attractions. For example shows alleging stadium Excalibur and Mandelay Bay. Fun sports book and sports bar right on site absolutely would stay here again.
30,You get what you pay for less expensive room than others on the strip. It’s certainly not as fancy and even a notch below comparable MGM properties like NYNY or MGM Grand.    It’s a 20-25 minute walk to the more central part of the strip (Park MGM / Aria) so if you’re prepared to do some walking or waiting for the tram this hotel is worth considering.    Not recommended for travelers with mobility problems. The movators along the walking corridors connecting Luxor and Excalibur were down or under maintenance most of the time. I saw an elderly woman in her walker struggling to get up a slight incline having to walk the part instead of catching the movator.    Rooms are decent but not a 4 or 5 star experience if that’s what you’re expecting.
50,The staff is extremely friendly and the property is clean and well maintained. Service is also exceptional. Rooms are spacious. Great location and easy to access in/out without being in the middle of the strip.
20,If you don't like coffee or a refrigerator to store your leftovers...this is the place. I've stayed in Vegas before at the Mandalay and expected the same type of luxury given that they are both MGM. I was dissapointed in the added fees for parking. I have never paid for parking or valet if I was a hotel guest. This was not the case. The extra charges if you get a good deal could be equal to what you were quoted. There should be transparency in order for families to prepare. Although it might be in the fine print and you never take advantage of the pool it should be optional. Resort fees are tricky...beware.
30,The room was clean but the shower temperature wouldn't go above lukewarm. The $30 breakfast buffet is definitely not worth the price! All the food was cold. The pool was nice but cold and closed at 3PM. The Blue Man Group show was great!
50,We stayed in a remodeled king corner suite in the 14th floor. The room itself was excellent clean and plenty of space. The TV was a little wonky and the lighting for doing makeup/getting ready was awful according to my wife but she made it work. The staff were nothing but helpful and we would gladly stay here again any time already have another stay coming up in January!
40,We had gone to a show at the Luxor - America’s Got Talent. When we arrived at the hotel security immediately offered a wheelchair to transport my husband to the venue from the front desk. The security person told us to call security after the show for a ride back. That part of the encounter was flawless. When we finished dinner an extremely nice man from the deli called security. The first call told us they would be there in a “few minutes”. The second call 15 minutes later said they were on their way. The third call said they had no one to send. The gentleman from the deli suggested I walk over to security myself which I did. A less than helpful person said she was sorry they were busy and this was not a priority and that I could rent a wheelchair to go from the deli to the front of the hotel. I asked to speak to a manger at which time I was referred to as an irate customer.    Thank goodness Paul Hill a security manager came. I explained the situation he reiterated the staffing shortage and priority for people with medical issues and then proceeded to find us a wheelchair. He then helped my husband into the wheelchair and drove him through the hotel to the Uber stand. He was kind compassionate and professional - he changed a nasty frustrating experience into a good one. We need more people like Paul Hill in the world! Thank you!!
10,I had a work emergency and needed to call someone. I was on the third floor of tower east room 371. I could not get cell service or internet access. .08 mbps but that was only for a few minutes until I got kicked off the hotel internet. I could use my phone for a hotspot but oh wait I had zero cell service.
10,So it was my 6th anniversary on the 3rd drove from Colorado to Vegas with my Wife got a really good rate on the room at The Luxor it all start with check in waited an hour to be checked in after getting our keys to the room went up to drop our bags off.. happened to notice that under the night stand there was a dirty tissue my wife called front desk to let them know and they were kinda rude about it the 2nd day we were there happened to notice there was people by the pool but no one in the pools my wife ended up calling front desk to find out why? she was told they would be open on the 3rd day of being the last day before check out. To say the least they didnt open the pool so myself and wife could not get in the pool and relax!  and then the 3rd day we were there i sat on the chair near the window in our room to put my shoes on i happened to notice there was a dirty mask under the cooler.. ended up having to call front desk again to let them know this was not OK. They did comp us a $100 to spend at the restaurant or bar within The Luxor.. the staff them selfs were very rude and unprofessional.. we will NEVER stay at The Luxor again due the bad experience we had while we were there.
10,Dusty rooms  Long check in wait lines  Lack of attention to detail  House keeping sucks  We could hear neighbor room alarms  Air quality was really bad  Poor Room service  Lack of knowledge by staff  Shows aren’t great
20,When we arrive the room was dirty and it was very dusty. There was hair in the bathroom sink also. We called the front desk about the room been dirty and they said they can't change us to a new room.
10,Every room smells like marijuana. No help with staff. No one will help you find locations. Staff does not help with room keys not working. Security takes forever to response to help. Do not stay here.
20,You are allowing a business to run a desk on the floor of your casino that is scamming customers. This is unacceptable. I thought that I was being comped a gift from THE LUXOR. Next thing I know they are running my credit card for $50 and requiring me to attend a 2 hour SCAM presentation which ended up eating 5 hours of my precious vacation time. COMPLETELY ABSURD. I will spread the word to everyone I know and everyone that I can reach via the internet. This is tarnishing your companies reputation and since its happening INSIDE YOUR BUSINESS ultimately this falls on your shoulders. If I had been gullible enough to be roped into their scam contract for a time share (as many others are and were every day due to you turning a blind eye to this scam) then I would be seeking legal action. Other than THAT my stay was fair enough for the price. I would tell you to take a look into your cheap and barely functioning blinds and tvs in the pyramid. Another strike against you was closing the pool at 5pm when online it says 6pm forcing me to pay entry to another hotel on the strip. Lastly this is the south end of the strip and its really not that convenient spend more money and do vegas the right way.
40,Pillows were too hard for my taste but I loved the bedding. We stayed in the East tower suites. Suite was old worn out table. needs updated desperately. Cleaning crew were fabulous! Casino was nice. Pool was SUPER COLD! You would think that after being hot all summer long the pool would be refreshing but it was too cold for many people to be there. They only had 2 pools open too. Not even the ones with the waterfalls. Kinda bummed about that. Diablo restaurant is a MUST! Fabulous salsa and guac!
50,This was a leisure trip and the 1st time to Las Vegas. Upon entering the hotel & casino I noticed how clean it was. The room was very comfortable with a dedicated work space and good view. The location was right on the strip and felt very safe. I would plan to stay here again.
40,Good casino with dining options across the board. Your going to pay for drinks but shoppette has a good special...buy 2 24oz beers get a free shot of liquor. The Fantasy show is fun and classy...worth the money!
40,"We spent four days at the Luxor and attended two shows there. The shows were great easy to find and the theaters were fantastic. The hotel is older and it showed in some areas but this did not affect our stay. Although the fee for each night is ""cheap""...when you add all the additional fees and taxes they came out to jus over $100 per night..so still not bad. The major negative is the cost of food at the hotel. It's insane!!!! The two of us spent just over $40 at the food court for ""fast food"" our first night. Won't do that again. We walked across the street to normal costing food and also got food at Target to eat breakfast and simply sandwiches. It's a cheap ploy by the hotel to NOT provide refrigerators or microwaves so a person can't easily use their own food. You'd think with gambling et. al. they could make it easier for people to eat inexpensively. Would I stay there again? Yes. But I might at least shop for other hotels to see if they are better."
50,We stayed at Luxor to attend the Notre Dame game at Allegiant Stadium. The location was excellent as we were able to walk to the game. Our room was very nice and had a coffee maker and refrigerator. We would definitely stay here again.
10,Charge me 200 hundred more at check our for nothing front desk guy rude and no housekeeping bed and pillows very uncomfortable the room eas no smoking and it was smoke stinky not recommended never
50,My stay at the Luxor has always been a positive one. Staff is friendly rooms are clean And ready when I arrived. I enjoy staying in the towers. I always go for comfort plus it’s worth it. enjoy your next stay.
10,Check in was disastrous. no options for anyone having disabilities. Waited in the long lines made even longer by having only 7 workers in the check-in windows. rooms were extremely dirty and obviously not cleaned. first room we had the scum was so heavy on the marble tops that my husband was able to write his name in the scum. AC was not working in the room. It was impossible to get someone to answer the phone. the bedding had stains on it and was obviously someone else had been in the room It took 3 days for someone to come up to the second room we had to fix the AC. Which died the next day again. He left a slight mess and asked if we wanted to have housekeeping come up and vacuum and we thought we would be safe waiting till the next day for housekeeping to come. The dust and mess that he made from fixing the AC was still there when we left along with a pretzel under the nightstand which clearly indicated the room was not vacuumed at all. Our sheets had stains on them and both my husband and I developed rashes from that bedding. I have been coming to Las Vegas since 1977 and never have I experienced something like this. My experience was not only shared by myself and my husband but another couple that checked into their rooms had to have housekeeping come to their room to remove poop from the wall. These are not experiences that your hotel should be happy with. Another fact was no refrigerators or coffee makers in the rooms. I strongly advise people to spend a little more money and stay at the Mandalay Bay hotel & Casino where customer service and cleanliness are their #1 priority.
30,Room was clean which is the most important thing but the hotel is old and needs some updating. With the number of places to stay in Vegas this is not one of my top choices. I will choose another hotel on my next trip.
10,Dark gloomy gross dirty…long black hair in shower black pubic hair on edge of tub couldn’t tell what was floor design & actual filth because they looked similar. Dead bug just inside the door w/ a bunch of black stuff. Just shagged out!
40,Great event with helpful venue staff and other supporting hotel team members but the facilities are a bit dated and in various conditions of disrepair. The main issues that I faced with rating this higher are the elevators condition the carpet wear and overall remaining life in the hotel room and general areas along with miscellaneous items like the automatic doors being hit or miss and not present in all or most entrances. Overall a good experience but it is time for a refresh on many of the facilities and building aesthetics.
40,Stayed at Luxor many times but this time its the 1st time staying in the 1 bedroom suite. The place was very spacious with the bedroom seperate from the lounge area. Although its a long walk from the casino to the room you do get used to it.
10,We stayed there 4 nights and 3/4 nights we had ice cold showers no matter what time we showered. The hotel staff was extremely unhelpful and said they would send house keeping to the room and never did so.
10,Not an enjoyable experience at all. Buffet was over priced ($60 per person) cold and tasteless. Rooms were very out dated and in need of serious repair and updating. Oh yes and takes forever to get a drink on the gaming floor from moody waitresses.
40,Room was clean and comfortable newly refreshed. Busy College Football weekend with some staff members stressed out. Close to the stadium easy walk to and from. Close to the airport and a free tram that gets you closer to the middle of the strip. Nice Mexican restaurant Diablo good food and service. Cellular service was horrible compared to other hotels in the area! Full bars but no throughput takes forever to load anything. Mobile Check-in/out App didn't work possibly due to the cellular service or the amount of people trying to use it at the same time.
50,Hotel was clean and beautiful. My room was amazing. I had a great view. Hotel was on the strip plus inside was so much to do. My wife had an amazing time for her birthday. The tub in the room was huge also
40,Over all we were pleased with the staff and the resorts room. overall pleasant stay  bathroom water pressure was low and needed to be updated. cleanliness was good as well as staff's friendliness. my husband and I would return than you.
10,Rude rushed us off and didn’t explain where rooms were located got lost on wrong elevators for a while with baby picked up phone to ask hotel operator was rude like we should of know that they had other elevators. Terrible customer service and rooms dated in “Premium Tower” never staying here again to many options!
40,I had a great stay at Luxor. The elevators are unique if not a bit awkward. I would like to stay in a tower room next visit to compare but I was very happy with my pyramid room. Great drink specials at Flight Bar. Tons of slots and decent dining options make this a great value for you money. Easy access to other nearby properties really help hammer the value prospect home. Just a bit nicer and less family centric than Excalibur right next door.
50,The Luxor is a great hotel/casino that has great food wonderful staff and is in a great location. The DJ vibe on Friday and Saturday nights is awesome. I like that you can easily get to other area hotels without getting on main road or having to go outside (if hot).
20,It’s time to update this place!  Our room had the actual ceiling coming down in the shower. There were small “updates” to the room but if the ceiling is coming down and there’s previous guests hair all over the rooma new desk doesn’t matter. We did not complain while there because why waste our time to have to switch rooms? I’m sure they are aware of their ceilings falling as it’s not a sudden thing. The casino itself is mediocre. The cleanliness is absent as every glass door was filthy. We had to pay to park even though we are guests at $18 a night and the walk to the car is full of filth. Old carpetdirty glassgross!  Also the idea of paying parking on top of the resort fee is utter robbery. Resort fee for not using anything in the resort! Everything we did we paid for what’s with the constant fees?  The nickel and diming in Las Vegas is enough to ruin your experience. If you are nickel and diming at least use the money to update the damn hotel. This is my 5th stay here since it’s opening and this was my last.
10,Room was not cleaned!!  Out dated from photos posted  Staff rushing to clear line  Very busy place I must say.  Had problems with billing also  building smells like an ashtray.  Bed was very uncomfortable.  Carpet was very dirty.
10,This hotel charges too many extra fees charges for refrigerators in the rooms it did not have a coffee maker in the room the sink was clogged poor service at the Pyramid Cafe expensive resort fees
10,Chose this hotel because of it’s proximity to the stadium- It’s only a short walk through Mandalay Bay. Stayed 5 days and not one single morning did we have hot water. Stay here only if you are willing to shower later in the day or you actually prefer a cold shower!
20,If you are platinum or noir and do not care about the perks/privileges than come to Luxor. Every other property ensured we never waited on a line but at the Luxor we were treated like everyone else.  I will say we did enjoy getting the day started with bottomless mimosas at the cafe. Oh yeah no room service. Our rooms were blah at best and definitely not clean. Views were terrible. But security seemed to be on the money the whole time. Things happened but quickly and quietly. Hallways smelled like weed. You can’t really blame casino for that. People are rude and have no consideration for others as they’re walking around with lit joints. Oh yeah NO ROOM SERVICE!
50,Booked another (very colorful) hotel months ago  slightly off the Strip and they tried to charge us a different price than promised after a 2 hour check-in. Stayed one night and booked the Luxor for the next two. Check-in was a breeze I had my dog and there was no issues. They're was a concert one night and a major football game the next day and the staff kept everything going smoothly. Didn't realize until I walked deeper in the casino that you could still smoke in there. You couldn't smell it anywhere else in the resort or in the rooms (unlike other places). Staff and bartenders were very happy to help make our trip great. Don't waste your money at hotel that doesn't even pretend to care about you.
50,We called for a room reservation at Luxor. The lady on the phone was helpful and detailed. The valet was quick on their feet just a little pricy with the resección going on. Check In was quick and easy. The room was clean but no refrigerator. The Pyramid cafe has good steak but the service was mediocre. Overall it was a good stay and definitely coming back.
50,We stayed on the premium 2 queen beds. The room was very clean felt like I was home. I hate sleeping with hotel bed covers but here I had no problem and was comfortable to trust the cleanliness. I did have a hard time parking but that was because of a near by event going on by the hotel. Everything from check in to check out was perfect. Thank you!
40,The Luxor may be older than some others hotels but the staff is great the location is perfect and it has everything you need for a great stay at an MGM resort. I would stay there again and recommend it to anyone that is looking for a great hotel on the strip.
50,Checkin was quick room was recently renovated and was extremely roomy and nice. Shower pressure was awesome. Nice and close to Allegiant which was handy. Several food places near by and lots of entertainment available.
40,The hotel is very beautiful. The staff was very friendly and accommodating to our requests. There was a wide variety of food which made the evenings enjoyable. The shows offered are also amazing. The hotel and casino are definitely a must on your trip to Vegas.
20,This casino should be torn down  the smell is unacceptable inhaling this is not good serious ventilation and sewage mixed together is a hazard to one’s health there has to be something to fix this not just the guest experience this but also the staff! Positive things staff is awesome
30,The room rates are expensive. Even thought get free couple nights and free food rewards. Parking fee too expensive . The buffet food are the same every days. Just the the seafood section a little different
20,I did not have hot water in my shower two mornings in a row. The waiter/waitress staff on the show floor was almost non existent. You had to give up your place at a table and get yourself a drink if you wanted one. I had to go and hang out at a different casino for the night to get the kind of customer service I wanted. There was marker writing on the walls of multiple floors. The maid service did not come. I had to call and request it. The staff I did deal with were very nice. My rating of 2 is based on my experience there. I don't currently plan to stay there again.
30,"I was excited to stay at a ""luxury"" Las Vegas resort that has been a mainstay of the Vegas Strip. What I got instead was a shiny exterior and unimpressive stay. The value of the accommodations paled in comparison with bargain brand hotels that provide what many consider basic amenities: coffeemaker microwave mini fridge..none of which were found at Luxor. The room was reasonably clean albeit a bit shabby. My sliding glass shower door came apart with the slightest touch and came crashing down making me instantly wonder why I had spent so much money for such a hassle? Unexpected charges and contradictory information from concierge left a smack of 'gotcha' in my mouth. An expensive and overrated food selection at the hotel buffet left me with a bitter taste in my mouth; making me regret my choice not to simply get fast food off premises. Next time I go to Vegas I think I can do better than Luxor."
20,Water in our room did not get past lukewarm before 10am. We were told to “let it run “ but that doesn’t help when other guests are also using hot water for showers apparently.  Long lines and crowds everywhere.  Poor directional signage.  Comfy bed and room was clean. HHousekeeping provided daily.  Elevators do not work well. Lots of people complaining during trips up and down.
40,There are a number of restaurants to choose from including a food court. The pools (more than one) look amazing (we didn't use). My biggest complaint there is no fridge or microwave in the room. The Blueman show was fun.
50,I like the modern sleek style of the tower rooms. Cant go wrong with Luxor the best property for the money. Great food options with Diablos and Pub House. Will be coming back. I like the south end of the strip it’s more peaceful.
30,Room was subpar. Required to pay a resort fee for staying less than 12 hrs and the room was way over priced. Staff at check in was rude and didn’t want to answer any questions she was quite annoyed with any questions we asked.
50,Awesome service clean rooms great staff! Will stay again. Loved the location of it as well. Close to tons of attractions. (Allegiant stadium is right across the freeway.) Next time I make a trip I’ll be looking here first.
50,Very friendly clean and an awesome vibe! The check in was easy and fast with multiple options. Also they accommodated us as we had rooms far away from each other. they got us 2 very close rooms at no additional charge. A+
10,Luxor felt like Jail. There was no good lighting in the rooms or outside.  There was no ventilation. Our room smelled like Cigarette smoke through out our whole stay. My clothes that were still in my luggage smelled like cigarette smoke !  The wall paper was coming off. The rug looked awful.  The staff did not have any knowledge in regards to directions in the hotel. When asked where is our room they gave us wrong directions. They were more interested in up charging Vouchers. Luxor should be torn down and start “Brand New!” With the the cost of Luxor they should at least owe it to their visitors.
20,We stayed at Luxor for a week & had a few issues. I’ve been staying there for years but time to change hotels because they’ve really gone downhill. Pool service terrible. VIP was supposed to hold tickets at Bellagio for a show got there no tickets. The lady at the box office went above & beyond for us even asking fellow workers for help. I called Luxor & was told she couldn’t access the system because it was past 5 p.m. Not good in my books. Definitely not staying at Luxor next visit. Bed wasn’t as comfortable as usual. I got comp’d stay connecting rooms which was nice but didn’t enjoy much of anything there except food in pyramid cafe. Everything closed early such as buffet and other restaurants there.
10,Rates weren’t fully disclosed. On top of that they overcharged me. View from room was the dirty towel covered top of Starbucks. Elevators hard to get to. Noise permeates the room making it hard to sleep.
40,The staff was friendly and the rooms kept clean. Not a fan of the smoke friendly casino. There ended up being a big water leak in the hall right outside our room and it smelled absolutely terrible. I do love the MGM app and being able to check in and out on my phone. And having the keyless key on the app. It expedited a lot. Overall a good experience. Just wish we had a choice in our room so we could have had a view.
40,Enjoyed my stay. The staff was friendly and the room was cool. There's so much to do there- eat drink shows the huge pool and spa! Simply put- the hotel is absolutely beautiful! I'll be visiting again!
10,Upon entering my room and utilizing the bathroom I saw long hair and pubic hairs on the outside/inside of the toilet. I know it was not cleaned prior. Also there was mucus on the shower wall that my toddler pointed out. Very very disgusting! I am not even sure if my sheets were clean. Do not stay here.
30,We stayed here with comps from MGM in a stay well room on the 26th floor of the pyramid.    Lets start with the rooms. If you are looking for a comfortable bed to sleep in and not spending time in the room than this is a great option especially if its a comped room. The rooms are OLD outdated and dusty. They were falling apart and definitely could use some love. We didn't hate them but wouldn't pay hundreds of dollars to stay here.    The entertainment dining drinking casino and spa were all AMAZING. We ate at Diablo's Catina visited Carrot Top/Americas Got Talent did a bunch of gambling in the casino and had a five star couples massage/spa treatment at Nurture Spa on property.    We were looking forward to spending time at the pool on Saturday when we were there. Showed up and it looked like they were severely understaffed. Only one of the pools opened at it was a bit overcrowded. With four large pool sections and four whirlpools...only having one of each open on a SATURDAY was extremely a let down.    Overall we enjoyed our stay and would definitely return with comped nights.
10,I am sure the rooms were ok 20 years ago but now they smell terrible bathroom is outdated with patches in the walls for plumbing fixes. I was not impressed at all. The beds were uncomfortable. The TV was fuzzy. Very disappointed in the hotel.
50,Very spacey. Really don’t have to leave the hotel. Good rooms good food good entertainment.Excellent service.Great pool.Not really that far from other casinos.Would definitely go back again.Grat gaming selection.
10,Don’t stay here  Staff is not good not friendly  I wish I stayed somewhere else  Don’t waste your money  Staff is not friendly even if you are a upgraded member of Mgm rewards  Mgm staff is horrible after COVID
50,Need a mini refrigerator because you waste a lot of money on food because you have to threw it out and just have a sitting area for guests also better mattress and smell of room. Over all good lay out
50,We were finishing our cross country road trip with Vegas and it couldn’t have been better. From the cafe and food court to the location everything was perfect. I’d definitely stay here again or check out another MGM property
50,I was only in town for one night because I missed a flight. So I found an inexpensive stay for $18 at Luxor. I expected it to be cheap but it was amazing. Beautiful resort! But the pool was closed the entire time of my stay and I had no access to amenities. Except for the resort fees I thought it was great!
10,Iconic hotel but seriously needs to be updated. Rooms and areas of the hotel were dated and very dusty. Service and restaurants were great!!! But I won't stay there again felt like the room was from a super 8.
50,My husband and I got married on the strip but stayed at the Luxor for five nights and it was very nice. We had a one bedroom tower suite and very much enjoyed the room. Plenty on space to entertain and still have our own space. Highly recommend the Lux. Thanks so much!!
50,My wife and I went to Vegas to get married. We have stayed at the Luxor numerous times before and loved it. This time we decided to try something new. We booked with the RIO and it was terrible! The rooms were old bizarre and dirty. The next day we checked out and went back to the Luxor. It was like seeing an old friend. I won't even waste time at another hotel from now on.
50,The Luxor is easy to navigate clean and is a overall great place to stay. The staff was very helpful. Also the best shows I saw on the strip where all located at the Luxor. The fact you have to have a key to use the elevators is a big plus in feeling safe
20,Stayed here for 3 nights but was not up to par to what I am used to while staying at the Luxor. Bathroom was not completely clean. Water pressure low. Toilet wouldn’t flush all the way. Tv remote would not work.
50,The Luxor was nice and clean during our stay. We had one problem with our stay and the front desk made it right and even took more off of our bill. They went beyond and mistakes happen ( we are all human) so I was impressed. I believe when something goes wrong is when you see an establishments true colors. I was very impressed I would not recommend Wolf Gang Puck at all. Go somewhere else (it’s in the MGM Grand) worst customer service ever.
50,We saw two shows AGT & BLUEMAN GROUP both very good and would recommend either or both shows during your stay. The hotel had enough staff to keep everything running smoothly. The Pyramid Cafe is a great please for breakfast and the bar area's are good also. The Buffet needs some adjustments in improving.
30,This was our second stay at the Luxor. (First time was in 2013). I’ll start by saying that we stayed in a newly remodeled pyramid room. While the room was pretty and clean (for the most part) it’s almost like putting lipstick on a pig. Sadly the rest of the resort hasn’t been taken care of. The elevators need fixed there were times you’d wait 15 mins for the elevator to come to the floor. The hallways to the room are dark and drab wallpaper coming off exit signs sinking into the walls etc.    Our shower wouldn’t drain so my husband called the front desk. They couldn’t give us an estimate time of when that would be fixed. He tried calling again and could tell someone picked up but wouldn’t say anything. He ended up going to the front desk and asking for a manager. We only stay at MGM properties and we’ve never been treated this poorly. An hour later someone finally came to fix the shower which then made a mess all over the shower bed and floor. Said he’d send housekeeping up to clean. They never came so we just went to bed and dealt with it ourselves I’m the morning. We went with another couple they got upgraded to a Tower room and they had the same shower draining issue but just dealt with it since their room was completely comped.    All in all we’re planning on sticking with MGM properties but won’t be staying at the Luxor again. Kind of wish Hard Rock would’ve taken this location and left Mirage alone.
40,Clean  Room was quite  Got to keep curtains closed during day or room gets very warm  Nice bathroom  Water pressure  Beverages while at machines was very good  Diablo was great  Steak taco’s delicious  Elevator a little bumpy
40,Enjoyed the quieter end of the strip and still made our way to the middle via the free tram. Can find wverything we need for food and accomodations at the luxor and still attend shows via uber and the tram.
50,Starting with checking in to food to the room I was extremely satisfied. Me and my family were impressed and are planning to stay again pretty soon. Both restaurants we ate at were very memorable meals
50,The front desk staff went beyond the call of duty. When we arrived early the staff arranged for us to check in at no additional charge due to the fact my rewards card status would change during my stay.
20,I have always stayed at MGM hotels when we come to Vegas. Just checked out of the Aria and checked in here….. wow is there a difference. I enjoy the Luxor for the amenities in the casino area. You have a wide range of food and restaurants to choose from that don’t break the bank. I reserved a Deluxe Tower Suite because reviews all state the pyramid rooms are dated. The towers aren’t much better. If you get west tower third floor I hope you enjoy looking at a dirty roof top with AC units. The bed is barely off the floor and uncomfortable. The lights are probably dim to keep you from seeing how dirty it is. I don’t even know what to say about the yucky bathroom or the fact we set the AC at 60 and it feels like 76. The digital key worked at first and then decided to stop in the elevator making us stuck going up and down and then the doors not opening. I have been waiting to see a specific concert for 2 years and may god have helped the front desk had I not gotten out. Then I had to rush through the huge pyramid to get to the counter where the check in like is huge. Luckily that have a print your own key card and I did that and ran back to change. Honestly I’ve had rooms at Excalibur better than this place and it’s considered the cheap place.
40,Very good stay. They have a few bumps and bruises but all and all the service and cleanliness was very good. Sylvia at the Front Desk was an Angel! She made sure I got my Free Veteran parking straight with my MGM Resorts membership. It saved me no less than $75 in parking! #ThaGRINDERS
50,I got plenty of rest ate good food . I’m not a drinker or gambler. I sat down on a quarter machine and put in a dollar and won 80 dollars. We able buy some nice gifts for my family. I will be back and will bring family
40,It was a good hotel however the elevator needs more improvement. And the outside parking to hotel was overwhelming. You have to park far even if you pay for parking. So getting from the parking to hotel is long from the parking entrance to room is even longer. This hotel is really good but please bring good walking shoes cause you will need it.
50,Great value and location for the Raiders game. A few comp nights made up for the $300 Saturday night. Definitely prefer the Mandalay but they’ve priced me out. The Luxors elevators can be a little rough especially if one is locked down.
10,Cleanliness and/or sanitary conditions needs serious improvement. Amenities are non existent (no fridge no microwave no coffee pot). Parking was not included in the coat of the room. Felt nickel and dimed.
10,1- room was completely dirty with dried ketchup on the garbage can blood in the bathroom on the tiles and up the shower stuff on one of the beds cum on the window and finger prints eyelash spoolies on the ground front desk staff told me i was wrong with my reservation and that I wasn't supposed to be checking in when i had the copy of it on my phone with all the info was given a gift certificate for the troubles.. that we couldn't use. Was double charged at a bar we could not get it fixed. Our myvegas rewards we were told we could not use them because we were not there for more than 3 days our trip was from Sept 30 to Oct 5th...
10,This is the worst Hotel I've been in. If you want to constantly ask questions and never get help or never stop walking and would like to be abducted feel to experience the wrath of the Luxor. First this hotel sits in a bad area. People that are not guests come up the very long walk away and pee do drugs drink and homeless people sleep there. If you walk across the street to the Mini Mart do it on mid day or not at all. I walked from our room to the Mini Mart one morning it was still dark. It took 20 minutes to get to the crosswalk. Once there a young man approached me then a car pulled up and they were trying to get me into the vehicle to go for a ride! No way. The walk back was closer to 30 minutes. It was up hill. The rooms are so far away from casino and restaurants. If you want a taxi you wait in a half hour or to a 45 minute wait in line that took 15 minutes from your room to get to. Forget renting a car and staying here. It will be parked a mile away and you will have to walk there take a taxi or wait for the valet that will get it in for you in their time which was the pace of a glacier moving. Forget the bell hop they are worse than Valet. You are not allowed to use the luggage carts. You have to go to the Bell Hop get your ticket and wait. We came back from the grocery store and waited an hour to get our groceries brought up. I'm giving the customer service here at a 0 because there's none. We only stayed 2 nights of our week and checked out.
30,Nice hotel. Mattress not so good for someone with arthritis or hip issues. Wish we could have stayed inside pyramid but had room in the tower. Good security to floors with card and not letting guests to floors they are not staying on!
20,My husband and I have stayed at this property together multiple times and he has come here on guys trips as well. This is not his first trip back after COVID. He was here last year. The check-in lines have always been stupid long and this time even though we were checking in after midnight it was no different. The lines was snaked three or four times around the barriers they had two people working and neither of them had any sense of urgency.  We planned to spend the days at the pool since the weather was still in the 90’s here. We rented chairs for the week which came with a host to provide towels and water and umbrella service throughout the day and also included bar service. The highlight of the trip was Cameron Brittany and Marta that we had on days two and three. Their service was above and beyond anything we received at the hotel. The service on days 1 and 4 was severely lacking not just by us but was felt by others in the area as everyone was having to chase down the host and server to request items.  Evenings and nights we had show tickets but had planned to come back to the Luxor to gamble. The first night we tried to gamble there there was zero energy in the room. No excitement coming from any of the tables. None of the dealers interacting with people at their tables and all you really heard was the slots. In contrast we went to another property to gamble and it was alive and energetic. A fun vibrant environment.  We have made the decision that we will be trying a different property to stay at from here on because this trip was so disappointing
40,Just few small things here and there would have been nice like my wife’s rewards thing working getting a king. No coffee maker was frustrating even tho knew that going in on the casino floor everything was good until got ID every time we sat down at a table maybe 5 times all on the Tuesday the 4th I dunno if some supervisor was there or something but clearly all parties with me were of age
30,Bed was comfortable and room was dark but it would have been nice if the AC tv and remote worked. This was our anniversary trip we had fun but probably would never stay here again. What can I say you Live and you learn
50,We decided to stay one more night and we chose luxor those legs are which was a great choice wrote easy to check in with the rapid check in with the phone didn't have to wait in the big line They have employees helping you The room was nice and clean just FYI No more refrigerators in the room I was told only Suites have the refrigerators
40,Would stay there again. The staff was friendly and the rooms were clean. Only proem I had was that there was no refrigerator in the room but not being in the room that much so it wasn't that big of a deal.
10,Our first room had mold everywhere in the bathroom when we went to front desk they said they’d take of it. It was not resolved an when we went back to front desk they told us we had no idea what we were talking about. They were extremely rude and kept rolling there eyes. Made us feel as if having our room be dirty was our own fault and we were just another paycheck. Definitely don’t recommend staying here.
50,Luxor was a lot of fun being connected to the Mandalay Bay was great. We will be back for sure. Next time with a group of friends. We didn't get to see everything that we wanted to. Will be back for another Raider game and to hang out.
50,Got one of the cheaper days & stayed here one night to see Blue Man Group on the property. Also has a cheap deli bagel with cream cheese for 5.00. Moved over to Planet Hollywood for business event but came back one evening to see America’s Got Talent show.
30,The luxor is really cool on the outside and inside love all of the exhibits and food selection but the rooms leave a lot to be desired. Everything seemed pretty run down railings warped rickety shaky elevators plaster coming off dark and dingy. Room was technically clean and bathroom was updated and a nice size but the room was a little dated and run down. Bed was hard and bouncy but comfortable enough. Room was oddly extremely humid the entire stay which felt gross even when running the air purifier 24/7 and keeping the air very low. View was great room was a good size nice size desk. We brought our own fire stick hoping to relax at night with our own shows but the TV and remote were completely locked down so we were stuck with what they had on cable. Also every time we turned on the TV or switched to the menu the TV defaulted to a crazy high volume like 30 that just seemed unnecessarily loud especially at night. We had to immediately mute the TV until we were ready to watch something and could turn the volume down. Room smelled a little musty and slightly smoky just from the way the air rises up to all of the room balconies from the casino. That said everyone we encountered was extremely friendly and helpful.
10,This hotel overall is very dingy dirty and smoky. The room had no view no clock no hair dryer and no mini fridge. The beds were uncomfortable and pillows were lumpy. There is no sound proofing because I was awakened multiple times a night by doors slamming voices and music in the hallway. The only positive was the friendly staff. There is a reason the Luxor is one of the cheaper hotels in Vegas. I would NEVER stay here again!
50,The staff was fantastic! From the front area to the casino! This was my first time going to Vegas so it was awesome that everything was close by. Plus the room was very clean and the hot was perfect! Love the idea of needing the key cards to access the room floor
10,Outdated room with a view of the dumpster. Front desk was very rude & not helpful. Wouldn’t let me change rooms. Told me I was stuck with it since I checked in online. I will not return to this hotel.
40,No complaints about the hotel. Comfortable beds. The quality of the buffet was really bad.  I would go back to stay there but would never go back to the buffet sadly.  The rest of the members in my party feel the same way
50,Good place to stay for a good price very close to the airport and rooms were good. It’s connected to the tram that takes you to Mandalay and Excalibur as well so that’s a plus. The food in the cafe that is located there was good also they were huge portions for a good price and tasted well.
30,Many promise broken. Tv turning on by itself in middle of night. Guest far away from us. They were to be next to us. Leaking ceiling/wall. Could tell when housekeepers were off as room cleaning was poor.
20,Didn’t get the room I reserved and there was no cocktail waitresses to be found anywhere in the casino. Place seems very outdated however the shower pressure was really nice. I saw a life guard sleeping on duty too. Lol
40,Was a decent stay for a last minute quick trip. Room was clean and i had a nice view.. shower was a slow drain and getting the digital keycard to work was a pain. And i had to get 4 sets of room keys the first 2 after i couldn't get the digital key to work would not work either i ended up having to make my own at the quick check in.
40,$13 a night get sounds great + $35 Resort Fee + $25 Parking Fee!! Then a Raiders football game on Sunday = $180 a night + Resort Fee + Parking Fee!! Very outdated hotel. Needs upgrades badly. Great location!!
50,I had a really good stay at the Luxur Hotel & Casino. The location was perfect for my needs. The walk to the Raiders stadium was close to the hotel. All off the shops was available for my needs. I felt safe in all of the areas of the hotel. food was great! staff was exceptional!
40,Excellent stay. Hotel was slightly dated although clean. Some restaurants were closed and some closed early afternoon. Spa was excellent and registration very helpful in extending our check out time and then when our flight was canceled they were helpful in allowing us to stay an additional night. We would stay here again!
50,This hotel like the others have lots of slot machines😂. There was a lot of walking maybe need more signs to get around when needed for things other than that room was cozy. Oddly shower door didn’t move so you had to shower with door open🤔. First day water was like warm by third day it was hot!
50,Worth every penny. If you go somewhere else you either pay too much for bad accommodations or you pay too little for any accommodations. Next time when I will return to Las Vegas I will definitely stay at Luxor again. Awesome price helpful staff best location.
10,Key cards broke 2 times in the first 12 hours. The second time my wife just went out to grab some ice in her pajama. She had to go all the way down to the lobby and the staff made her wait in line for 45 min before giving her another card. I went down to the speak with a manager and they said that just because she was half naked carrying her ice bucket that didn’t give her a priority over other guests. My wife got back tot eh room and called me crying. I have never felt so disrespected in my life. The manager did not offer any sort of apology and rolled her eyes right in front of me. I will NEVER stay here again.
50,Beautiful rooms great housekeeping excellent staff quiet for sleeping nice location great value for your buck! Loved the bed extremely comfortable! Lots of events and shows in and close as well.
40,Stayed Monday to Friday for a conference. Arrived early and was able to check in. The initial line is daunting however there were a number of agents at the desk that moved the line quickly. First impression very dark inside. Had read previous reviews so opted not to use mobile key. Check in took maybe 5-7 minutes tops. My room was in the pyramid so accessed the sloped elevators. Some lights didn't work for certain floors which makes you think your key card didn't work but once I saw the light on on the opposite side panel I knew it was accepted.    My room was just finished cleaning as the housekeeping were next door. I entered smelled of carpet cleaner i guess. was disappointed to see two nfl tickets from the day before sticking up from the side wall of the chair and the seat cushion along with what looked like a chip crumb. also disappointed to see drip spots in front of the toilet. Out to the housekeeper i went next door to have the bathroom floor mopped. no big deal just disappointing. Also disappointed to not see a mini fridge to chill water given there are no water stations in the hotel you must either buy or ask at the bar and they will provide you with tap water. The faucet in the bathroom was loose although functional. The windows get very warm on the airport side during the day requiring the drapes to be closed adding to the dark motif. Also found the tv very loud when turned on initially. bed was comfortable and clean. no bed bugs for me. :). two side chairs and a desk and room was relatively spacious. AC worked fine and kept the room cool.    Carrot top and blue man crew were the shows at the casino and did seem to have some action. Looked like Titanic show was being set up soon.    i found the staff to be helpful when asked. The breakfast restaurant was large and relatively quick although for a slightly cheaper ($1-2) a much better breakfast can be had at Ri Ra in the walkway between Luxor and MB. $8 for a smaller tube of toothpaste is robbery.    the pool staff checks your bag (although not that well) for people bringing I presume their own drinks to the pool. Maybe just checking for glass I didn't ask. Whomever thought a maximum 3ft deep pool is a good idea is an idiot. too deep to sit on the pool bottom for most and not deep enough to swim so you pseudo crouch.    for the price not a bad spot. a bit of a walk to the stores after the tram to excalibur. I would probably stay at a nicer spot if I wasn't there on my company dime and needed to be in walking distance to MB. But for the price i thought it was decent value.
10,While the staff was generally friendly and helpful that was the single positive. constantly getting nickel and dimed for everything was a joke. having to pay 54 bucks for self-park while staying at the hotel was a big joke. In the room there were stains on the sheets and stains on the ceiling (room 6-113). There was no mini-fridge or coffee which are standard amenities at a Motel 6. I was forced to pay 50 dollars a day as a deposit for incidentals I was told i would get it all back. we got 51 dollars back so that was just a bold-faced lie. They could have redeemed themselves a bit. we left a two-case cooler with our dirty laundry and souvenirs as well as snacks in the room as we were in a hurry to escape. We contacted lost and found the same day and were told it wasn't found. It took multiple calls and an on-line entry to finally get a call back and one could tell that they A) didn't look and B) didn't care. Seriously a big red cooler and we now have no souvenirs of our one and only trip to Las Vegas. Yes it was careless on our part but we hated the place so much we couldn't wait to get away.  So basically the place was dirty tawdry they treat their guests like crap and steal from them. I think that would pretty much lead to a null score anywhere.
50,Well to start off friendly staff. I get lost in casinos even if there are signs but asking staff made it easier sometimes and they were always happy to help with a smile. Lines go fast at the registration desk even if it's long.    I had the updated pyramid king room. It was gorgeous. Soo comfortable great view of Excalibur next door. It had everything except a fridge but they do provide you with an ice bucket and ice machine on the floor. Can be a walk to the machine but the view is great since it's open to all the floors and middle of pyramid below. Bed was very comfortable made me want to sleep in longer. Wifi a little spotty. Bathroom was nice and had a rainfall showerhead. Interesting thing the elevators in the pyramid to the rooms are at an incline. Feels weird but fun.    The pool was great but crowded. You have to start early with this crowd to get a good seat by the pool. The bummer with the pool is that the water slides were not running. But hanging out at the pool with great company made me also want to stay longer there too.    Didn't do the buffet since I was more interested in going to Eataly close by at MGM Park. Don't be fooled that there aren't enough places to eat just because it's not at the middle of the strip. Soo many places to eat around you.    Getting around was easy. They have a free tram that takes you between Mandalay Bay Luxor and Excalibur. They have a walkway from Luxor to Excalibur and even to New York hotel without going to the public sidewalk. Safer. Just follow the signs.    Weekday prices are of course cheaper than the weekends. For the value and comfort overall I would definitely stay here again.
40,I don’t know why so many people talk crap about Carrot Top but second time I’ve seen his show not bad seats for what I feel is a decent price. And he was hilarious!!! I’d definitely go again!! Must see
30,The room looks exactly like the picture. No refrigerator and microwave is ridiculous. You pay for a resort fee and parking and food storage isn’t included. My shower had hair in it and the bathroom door would not shut.
50,Checking in and out of the Luxor Casino and Hotel was a very new experience for us. Using my phone as a room key was strange but simple with minimal contact with staff. There were some hairs in the bathroom that hadn't been swept up but the large bath was awesome! I think they could use some more maid detailing but I'd go back.
10,I stay in a lot of hotels. This was the worst experience checking in ever. Staff was not very helpful and rude. Manager was arrogant and talked down to us.    Otherwise our room was nicer than we expected. Super clean.    The hotel/casino has some cool architecture. It is a fun place to look at.    Overall it is hard to rank this casino above a 1 because of the poor check in staff and process. If the check in were average I would probably rank this a 4.5 stars and recommend it.
50,The Luxor was located in the perfect vicinity for my purpose in Vegas.. the pools Casino bars and restaurants were all filled with friendly and amazing staff. Not to mention the Starbucks and yogurt land :)
50,We stayed at Luxor for the second time and it did not disappoint! we were upgraded to a king tower room and it was the cleanest and most comfortable room ever! The service was amazing from arrival to departure!!
30,Our room was very dirty and musty for being a king executive room in the towers! The Luxor has not changed a bit since last year when we visited no seasonal decor or any new shows to go see. I will definitely stay somewhere else next time.
10,Very dated hotel. The whole place needs to be renovated. The restaurants food quality was poor. Worn out mattress. Not inviting at all. Next time I’ll stay at the holiday inn instead. Very dirty hotel.
10,Gave us wrong room key. Spent 20 min before got the right room. Entered room filthy poop on bathroom walls bar sink sheets carpet all dirty. Edward housekeeping manager knocked on door to ask how we liked our Suite. He came in so we could show him the mess. He said we had to get out while they cleaned it.. 1 hour goes by and we went to front desk they said we cannot go back to that suite they would have to find us anther because they needed 3 days to disinfect. They sent us to the opposite tower suite and it was not good. Curtains falling down hot dusty  Not good. Back down at front desk. They said they do not have another suite.. so they put us in a Pyramid king.. not happy..  it was our first day on vacation and we lost half the day finding a place to stay..  plus the room we ended up in had some hand cart on rollers with a fridge rigged in the room.. what a joke.
50,We loved our stay at the Luxor and were very suprised with how cheap it was! The only downside to staying here is that you feel a bit far from the strip but we were expecting alot of walking so it was no problem!
20,Was locked out of our room for two hours because they claim we didn’t pay a deposit or resort fee. Anybody know if you’re staying in Vegas you have to pay a resort fee upfront along with a deposit in order to get your room key we booked from September 30 through October 3rd on October 2 a day before we had to check out we was locked out of our room. Somehow no one cared besides one worker who claim to give us our resort fee back and a $100 voucher for food and drinks. Will not stay here again
40,Stayed here for a week at the end of September from Scotland and we were there to get married (not in hotel). Check in was fairly quick room was basic but clean and spacious and comfortable. AC was good tv worked fine and bathroom was spotless. Staff were all really friendly and helpful. Hotel had good amenities and we enjoyed being at the southern end of the strip. Only small criticism would be no fridge in the room which would have been nice and the shower head was extremely low with no movement for my 6 foot 3 husband but apart from that was perfect. Wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.
10,Do not stay here. No security cameras. Staff/managers/security are rude and unprofessional. We arrived Friday 9/30/2022 and were burglarized later that evening. Our luggage/cash was stolen from inside our locked hotel room at Luxor resort. My debit card was stolen and fraudulently used at a local liquor store and convenience stores nearby. We were robbed of close to $3000 of personal items/cash and had nothing the next 3 days of our vacation. Our entire vacation was ruined. We spent most of our time in Ubers trying to recoup what we had lost as well as time spent waiting to speak with hotel managers/security and hours spent filing a police report. Luxor hotel staff was not accommodating seeing this happened on their property. They were rude unprofessional and were not able to help us in any way due to us booking through Allegiant Air football package. MGM corporate is almost impossible to contact to file a formal complaint. Las Vegas crime on the rise. Don’t do it
10,Bathroom had signs of old dirt rings in the shower and at the tub and toilet. Hardly any staff made the stay sterile and underserved. I’m a returning pre-Covid customer and expected better. I get why it’s understaffed however the efforts to automate so much of it was sterile and full of glitches.
50,Staying at the luxor currently. i really like it. nice hotel ans plenty to do and see. Seeing Carrot top Wednesday and mad apple tonight at NYNY. I am having at truly good time here. I would like to spend more time here when i can. there is so much to do
30,Room wasn’t the cleanliness. Air conditioning in room wasn’t working. Room definitely needed TLC and paid a premium price for just mediocre stay. Best part of the hotel/vacation was just being there with my spouse kid free.
10,Room was very average… bathrooms below average!!! No internet access in our room and half the time the tv didn’t work. obvious that they don’t want you spending time in your room! Lil access to my car
50,The hotel room is definitely different from others due to the pyramid shape. Biggest perks for myself and my group was 1) that it has a food court that we were able to get food at after a late night (4am) and 2) the doors are sound proof! I was right infront of the main lobby and could not hear the noise/music once I closed my door.    Only issue I had was the elevators take forever and a day to take you up. Could of just been an issue for that weekend since it was a raiders home game. Aside from that I had a very good experience at the Luxor.
10,No hot water for showers in the morning. Housekeeping made our beds but did not empty out trash. I understand now why we saw trash outside rooms and not picked up during our stay. Charge over $1000.00 For 3 nights because the raiders played a home game is ridiculous. Just stay at another hotel. Staff is also invisible….not trying to help anyone out.
30,Needs total updating! AC not good carpet wasn’t good no channel lineup for the tv no refrigerator or microwave. Staff was good proximity to Raider’s Stadium was great and the shower head was lovely!
20,So many issues with my room air conditioning was not working properly even after two technicians came out to fix and still not working TV not working  spent most of the mornings waiting for them to come fix issues never fixed correctly
20,Do not use the app to avoid check in you’ll end up in line physically checking in annoyed and angry. Staff were useless when we brought attention to the problem. Gave me $50 drink credit that did not even use. ………………………………………………………………………………………………..
50,Everything about our stay was great from the minute that we checked in all the way up until we checked out. Very friendly staff no matter where you went in the hotel. We will definitely be back next year!
10,The bathroom was dirty the floor had hairs make up and seemed dated like chipped; the shower door had mold and hard water in the bottom (not a little all over) the shower walls had hair; the carpet was visibly dirty. The staff in the food court was tired and not friendly. I have stayed in lower stars hotels that are less dates and cleaner.
50,This was an amazing hotel that was aesthetically pleasing the moment we arrived. The hotel had everything we needed food attractions and the rooms were clean & smelled fresh! Can’t wait to go back!!!
50,wow wow wow amazinggggg special I spent my special birthday here with 4 complimentary nights with my wife and we both are satisfy first time to stay here in Luxor thank you guys for making our stay super happy.
40,You are better off to bring your own liquor and make your own cocktail drinks in the room because the cocktail waitresses are very few and expect large tips for the extremely small weak free cocktails they bring you while gambling. And also always took at least 20 minutes for them to bring my drink back. A cocktail drink at the bar cost anywhere from 10 to $25.
30,The room never got very cold there was no mini fridge and the pool closed way too early! I also ate several meals at the hotel I spent hours gambling and never received a single comp. One night at dinner and 15 people in the server wasn’t willing to separate our checks.
40,The beds were really uncomfortable and the AC didn’t work. Otherwise everything else was amazing. Expect for the “drink ladies” I asked for water and never received it. It always seemed to never be around when you wanted something. But not a huge deal.
40,Luxor still has it. It has a decent location good gaming and is kept up beautifully. Still a Las Vegas icon. Not the most prestigious property but it is still relevant and for the price in Las Vegas it is hard to beat.
10,I try to give everyone a good review but this place in my opinion has been one of the worst experiences I have encountered in a long time. the staff was very unfriendly and unprofessional. I would not recommend staying here ever again.
20,Pay for room perfect pay resort fee and pay to park your vehicle. Not a good marketing plan. Room had some dirt left from previous guest like clothing tag and hard pink material on bathroom sink. Bed was lumpy. Not MGM fault but was woken at 3am and again at 4:30 am of people running down hallway yelling.
30,Located at the end of the strip be prepared to walk a lot. Public transport was awful on our trip bus every 15 mins? We waited 50 mins before walking on bus arrived next stop too full. Lost a hour. Not hotels fault obviously but be prepared or stay more central. However easy walking between MGM properties Excalibur NY NY MGM Grand Mandalay bay
30,I think room should have mini fridge and it did not the curtains were falling. The bed however was uper comfortable. No USB outlets. No drinks offered at the casino the first two nights we were there. I really was hoping for unforgettable luxury experience.
10,This place is just old and could use some remodeling. The room was dirty and we found a white sock left behind. How do they miss that. I left a day early because of issues out of my control but still had to pay full price. Staff didn't care and I am gold card holder.
50,I would recommend the Lexor to my friends & family. Very nice room. Very clean & nicely decorated. Great location to all the fun shops and tasty restaurants. Fun gambling and decor was beautiful. We took many pictures. I can’t wait to return 😊
40,This was a really nice stay with lots to do within the hotel and casino. Only issues were that the pool was hardly open and the key cards for the self parking wouldn’t work so we constantly had to call for assistance when exiting the self parking lot. Overall it was very nice.
30,The rooms are old and out dated. The shower was small and it was hard to get hot water. It was far away from the Las Vegas strip. The shows oftered at the hotel have been around for along time. There are no poker games you have to go the other hotel to play. There was only one of three pools open. The pool closed early because they don´t have enough staff.
30,Room was comped as part of an MGM promotion from my membership. Bed and pillows were comfortable. Thermostat constantly kept resetting itself to freezing temperatures on its own. No cell signal or phone service at all no fridge mo microwave no cable TV. Check in was easy through the app. Casino itself felt outdated tables and chips were dirty dealers were not friendly atmosphere in the gambling ares was 100% clear that all thry want to do is take your money rather then create an experience you would want to come back again for. That's the best way I can describe luxor.
30,Not a Bad hotel just not a Nice Hotel. When you are staying at that part of the strip Excalibur is a C- Luxor is a C Mandalay Bay is an A Delano & Four Seasons are A+. It is what it is. Would stay there again but only if the price is right.
10,Place is definitely run down I guess you get what you pay for smells of smoke was not happy. Place is clearly dated. Will pass on the clients who frequent as well. There was a whole in the shower door as well almost as bad as circus circus
30,Room was clean and in good order but the motion sensing thermostat to control the A/C in the room leaves a lot to be desired. The A/C turns off when the room is empty which makes the room feel like a sauna every time you return to the room.
40,The Luxor is in a great location. The rooms smelled fresh and clean which is difficult to find in Las Vegas. The beds and pillows were extremely comfortable. I got really great rest. It seems safe as well. It has a bit of an older crowd which I appreciated. Initially I though it was a bit dated but honestly it one of the cleaner hotels on the strip. I had a great stay. Great value!
40,For the price of the room it was worth the stay. Just small little issues with the room. When we had them clean the room they did not grab all of the trash laying around the trash can. For the price will stay again!
50,"Super convenient for the events I like to go to. 2 over there at the Luxor and one at the Mandalay Bay. ""Carrot Top"" and ""Blue Man Group"" (both at Luxor) and ""Santana"" at House of Blues (at Mandalay Bay)"
10,Pipes burst. Raining in the hallways. Ceiling caving in. Elevators getting stuck. Shower flooding. Springs poking through the beds. Resort fees that literally only get you access to the septic tank of a pool. Cocktail girls that ignore you. No mini fridge or microwave in your room to save your expensive leftovers. Seriously unless you’re rich and want to know what it’s like to live in squalor don’t go here.
50,Our 2 Queen bedroom was on the 28th floor great view. The room card is used for your room and the lift to 28 only which was a slight problem with some of our party on 24. The room was spacious clean and quiet except for the air conditioning which had to be turned off at night as too noisy. It had a safe but alas no fridge although we were close to an ice machine. The hotel had many eating places plus the large casino area and the staff were very polite and friendly. We were out a lot seeing the sights but knew we had comfortable beds for a good nights sleep. We enjoyed our stay here and would recommend it to others.
20,The facilities were nice the staff were wonderful housekeeping and hospitality were great. My room is the reason for the less than perfect rating. Out of the 7 showers I took one was warm one was hot the other 5 were cold (not even luke warm). I also rented a room with a soaking tub in the suite. Couldn't get the water warm for it everytime except once and the one time I did before I got in it I noticed yellow gunky chunks floating around and the tub faucet and handles were so cruddy at their base (didn't notice when filling up). The walls were too thin and my neighbor blared music in room from 6am until late into the evening. I tried to talk to them about it and when they didn't anwer I called the front desk 3 times and finally took some Nyquil and fell asleep waiting for the music to go down/ security to come. My room door didn't lock the door opened without a key and the maintenace man who came fixed it was nice but essentially said you have to change the batteries and hit it with a hammer and the this is a common problem. I noticed the door lock was stuffed with tissue while waiting for him. He stated someone must have done it to hold the door open while bringing put luggage.  The final room complaint was that although it was a non smoking room it smelled of cigarettes and I left there with strep throat from it.
10,Luxor needs lots of improvements. The buffet was horrible. The bed was horrible-sank almost to the bottom. The man cleaning the room on September 30th didn’t line the trash cans nor did he leave any more toilet paper-we ran out!
50,Everything from the casino pool restaurants and all service staff was just superb! Not one hiccup within a hundred interactions! We will be back to the Luxor! Sue was so accommodating responsive and resourceful that we felt like we knew everything there was to know about Vegas in just a couple days!
30,Charge you for amenities but you can’t enjoy it! Very inconvenient!! This is all hotel issues!! Our experience was that only one side of the pool was open only and we had to sit on the closed side and swing around to the open pool area. It just wasn’t enjoyable.
50,The service rooms and hotel itself was great. Had a great experience. I would recommend that you stay there when you go to Las Vegas. It's close to public transportation and has a tram service to take you to 2 other hotels.
30,"The rooms were a bit bigger than your average hotel.  The check in process was slow.  Restaurants should have longer ""open"" hours.  I was on the 4th floor so at times it was hard to sleep as the music level was disturbing.  Found a bug in bed."
50,We just got back and loved our stay. The hotel is very unique we loved the style of it. Lots to do inside.  We will definitely go back.  Thank you for a great first experience  Also go see americas got talent much see :))
10,"Horrendous guest service (40 minutes in queue to check-in express checkout didn't work on the only-sometimes-working app. Room look like original furniture from when it opened in 1993. Not a single USB plug. Despite the ""resort fee"" which was about equivalent to rack rate there was a hole where the refrigerator would have been if they hadn't ripped it out so they can charge you to rent one. Coffee is the buffet is instant."
50,My first time experience in Luxor was really good and it was all because of the customer services. Generally all the staff were really helpful and this made my stay more comfortable and enjoyable. I would recommend all my friends and family. Thanks.
40,This was a last minute stay as I messed up my reservation at the sister hotel at Delano. I needed a last MJ ute add to my 4 day stay at Delano but it was going to be 500.00 for a 1 night stay so I chose to check other hotels and the reservation clerk did an amazing job finding me the Luxor for 50.00 and I only had to walk over to the Delano after checkout. Happy happy
20,Strip location is not great for a Vegas experience. Overpriced food and drink. Luxor charges resort fees and in my opinion it is not a resort. People coming in off the street get the same experience as people who stay there. If your looking for a place close Allegiant Stadium the Luxor will do. Other than that I would recommend staying somewhere else.
10,Don’t disturb me during the day don’t nonstop checking if I’m ok. Your hotel do not have any services so why you care how’s my stay or my play? I don’t need wake-up calls because I never ordered one.
30,The hotel is starting to show it's age at least in the rooms. The water takes forever to get warm (never hot). Electronic check in and out is nice because the lines at the physical check in area are extremely long. Draw back on electronic key is that they don't work well in the elevators and missed our floor a few times because we couldn't get the key to work.
50,Everything was really clean loved the bed sooo comfy just as comfy as more expensive hotels I’ve stayed at. We went to an event to the new stadium and it’s right next door very convenient. We really enjoyed our stay!
40,My trip was amazing! The hotel is old but the rooms are great and really well located! Service was great and the best is the online check in and check out! It saved us a lot of time! For sure I will be back soon!
50,Hotel was amazing and the experience was well worth it! Got in late and they had us booked and in our room in less than 10 minutes. The casino inside had plenty of games to play. They had plenty of places to eat inside as well. Public house a eatery inside with a walk up bar and dine in had the best ribs and steak!
30,The pool has no natural shade to protect you from the sun. You can rent a cabana and that seems to be Management's desire. Unlike the MGM Park pool with its ample distribution of free-standing umbrellas Luxor's pool has none. We've stayed at Luxor before but this is the first time on the ground floor in a newly remodeled Pyramid King suite The windows must have leaked during a morning rain shower as later in the day when we walked bare footed near the window we could feel the wet carpet (I called housekeeping to report the issue to maintenance). Maintenance only required two calls on the second day to replace the failed lamp above the bathroom lavatory. The room was comfortable and all furnishings were new and attractive but no makeup mirror in the lavatory. The credenza below the large screen TV has a media panel with multiple 110v outlets an HDMI port and possibly VGA and/or component ports. Unfortunately I was unable to connect my HDMI device to display on the TV as the TV remote lacks' a media source selection button. I did not ask for assistance with this issue as it was only a minor inconvenience and don't know if it could have been resolved.
40,"This was a quick 2 day trip for a wedding. The hotel was nice! The room was quiet and the staff was friendly. The downfalls were: No fridge in room The buffet was closed Tue & Wed (those were the 2 days we were there) and I wanted to leave something at the front desk for my adult children in another room and they said ""they couldn't do that"" Those are my only complaints. Otherwise it was a good stay and I would probably stay there again."
30,Got back 2 am the ceiling above us leaked soaked bed So switch room and 100 comp for restaurant  2nd room when it rained the window leaked  This the corner pyramid suite  Received some comps off resort fee
10,Rooms are horrible! Totally unacceptable!  Remodel your accommodation! The noise played a major factor windows need to be upgraded to sound proof. Carpet in your hallways need to be changed out. Your hotel has an old smelly odor.
10,The hotel lobby was overly crowded. The staff that checked us in was not friendly at all. There was Hair in shower. The linens were dirty and the room smelled of marijuana . The iron stop working and when bee called for another one it never came. The people that cleans the room walker in on us twice. Now we had music playing each time.
20,Bathroom shower was clogging and it got fixed after I complained. The bathroom light was not working and they did not fix even though I called thrice. I had to shower with my phone light on since the bathroom was dark without the light. To check in to the hotel the line was lo long that it took me more than 1 hour I wish they had more staff on front desk.
40,We were in town for daughter’s wedding and the stay was great except for Wi-Fi service in our room  We would stay again as everything else was fine. Did appreciate the security of the elevator etc  Food and service was good and the ease to get a taxi was great
30,Nice and clean. To be recommended. Check in very slow and not so accommodating. Staff is nice and courteous whitout been “Disney Style” (so it needs an upgrade in formation). Housekeeping is just perfect.
10,It was our first (and last) stay there. I asked for a late checkout as per my MGM gold status. My daughter just needed about an hour and a half to take an important zoom call for work. The front desk said they were completely sold out and weren't doing any late checkouts. Well I looked online and there were plenty of rooms available. I called back and they said the only way to stay longer in the room was to book another night. So they lied about the hotel being sold out! We booked the room and at checkout found they charged us the resort fees that are supposed to be waived with our MGM gold status. I asked about it and they waived the resort fee but only for one of the nights. Just terrible and we won't be back!
40,Good Stay mobile check in and check out works well in a high tourist area. The tower elite king comes with a refrigerator which is not standard amenity in Strip hotels. We were able to view a show and eat at different restaurants without having to leave the hotel.
30,Stayed inside the Pyramid Inclinators need some updating. Most were broken or disabled on our first night probably it wasn't detecting the key cards long lines after a night of drinking and partying. Shakes on the way up but it became a good conversation starter for everyone waiting for a ride. Some water damage on the bathroom door and walls but these are minor details.. Definitely try their chicken and waffles at Pyramid Cafe I heard they updated it ate it for breakfast in 2 consecutive days of our stay. Their staff is awesome and welcoming we couldn't ask for anything else! I wish they rebuild this hotel from the ground up a vintage gem that is quintessential to the Vegas skyline!
10,"Don't waste your time staying at the Luxor in Las Vegas! Check in lines were ridiculously long and slow lobby was chaotic. No help to be seen from a real person almost everything is ""self checkout"" set up. Bags of dirty linens lined the hall on our way to the room."
50,I had a really wonderful time at the Luxor and the friendly staff were excellent. The location was ideal for visiting internal and external actives. I will be staying at the Luxor more now that I am retired and have the time to truly experience it's many actives.
30,Decent place to stay. Staff was nice and helpful. Rooms could’ve been a bit cleaner. Wish all three pools would’ve been open. Mexican restaurant was good and the manager was very nice. Rooms need mini fridges
50,Everyone was great. The room was clean. I will be back. The casino was in perfect condition. Great food choices and reasonably priced. The digital check in and out worked great No need to go to the front desk. Room was ready early. Parking was hassle free. Thank you
20,Las Vegas has a huge problem with vagrants on the strip this is not just an issue at Luxor. However if there were more security personnel I feel that the problem could be dealt with more effectively. I don't feel safe for my family to be outside without myself in attendance.
30,Overall a dated low amenity property. I suppose if ypu are looking for a cheap room it is fine but if you are here for the full Las Vegas experience pass on this and head closer to middle of the strip.
10,The Luxor is a well situated and cost efficient hotel for Business travel especially for attending conferences at the Mandalay. The Staff are friendly and helpful. The value was great considering the cost was about 4x less than the Mandalay but the rooms where extremely disgusting. Extremely outdated technology and plugs AC is not reliable and the room smelled of humidity and mildew. Bathroom fan barely worked and steamed up the entire room. I was with 5 colleagues each staying on a different floor and they all had the same experience. I would consider the Luxor as a peasant hotel when comparing the room to any other hotel in the area.
10,Dried seven on both of the chairs the bathroom ceiling leaked and the room smells strongly of cigars. The remote for the TV didn't work and the ac shut off around 2 a.m. so I couldn't sleep from the nevada heat.
50,We stayed for three nights. Never had an issue. Placed on a high floor which we loved. Nice to escape all the commotion of Vegas for awhile. We used the app for quick and easy check-in and check-out. The beds could use an upgrade not the greatest but not the worse sleep.
50,As always I had a great experience at the Luxor. Pool service with Miguel and Marta is top notch and if you get those two. Please tip them well :). The only complaint which wasn’t Luxors issue was the automated checkin failed. I wish the sushi restaurant was still open. But something new is coming. Room was perfect. Price was right.
50,"Great hotel in a great location with a beautiful resort style pool on premises. We stayed up in the pyramid and the ""inclinator"" elevators were like a roller coaster ride right in the hotel. Even with the hustle and bustle of the lobby/casino area the room was peaceful and quiet."
10,Unfriendly staff at front desk. They are not helpful at all and provide zero service to fix problems. Please train the staff in customer service for you will see an increase in guest stays regardless of price.
30,We found the common areas to be worn dirty and dated. This property is on the far edge of the Las Vegas strip. Everything else seems to be a hike or ride share away. Our first night in we ate at the puplic house restaurant. Traditional chicken wings garlic and Parmesan cold and tasted like the bag it came from. On the other hand wife had the burger and thought it great.
30,Overall vacation was okay. Rooms need updating-had to change rooms twice to find one satisfactory. Luggage was stolen from our room; security could be better (we were only offered $25 food voucher for our loss).
20,Will be checking out tomorrow was completely gas lit and made to feel stupid lied to about deposits and got the runaround. Everyone was so rude let's see if I even hear back from the customer service but probably not because it seems like they don't really care about their guests.
40,The experience was great room and food was amazing. The only thing was the time share people bothering every time they see you. The location was great easy access to everything. Housekeeping was also great
10,Cool outside. Nice lobby. Room was as bad as I’ve stayed in over my last 15 years. Nothing worth 300+…. Staff was very nice. Restaurants tires. 200 words is a lot to write when the review isn’t positive.
50,Our trip was amazing and very affordable. We plan the trip early and got a very cheap rate for our room also when you're there you can ask for early check-in which is usually around 11:00 or 11:30 if you download the MGM app you can get a faster early check in also check out was easy it's located on a great part of it towards the end but connects with two different hotels The Mandalay Bay and the Excalibur it was definitely a great time and I would suggest anybody to stay at the Luxor preferably the tower because it's newer and has better rooms in my opinion the weekend rates are a little more expensive because it's the weekend in Vegas but if you request your hotel Sunday Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday night the rates are usually very very affordable and I will definitely stay here again.
40,The rooms were nice comfortable and clean. The most of elevators were not running well and people got sick in them. That was the only thing that was not good about our stay but that’s a pretty big deal.
50,The lux was better than expected. Place has a nice vibe. Great service all around. Deborah Zook is an amazing employee  she was always there to help or get my players card when I lost it lol. Thanks again Deb. Overall I'll stay again at Lux.
10,MGM use to be a customer service hotel with high standards and expectations. Now they can care less about the customer the upkeep of their facilities or the customer experience. It’s all just riding the destination cash cow! We booked a king bedroom & upon check in was informed there were no more king rooms available unless we wanted to pay for a suite upgrade. When my wife & I explained we reserved a king bed room we were told MGM guarantees only a room not room types. We asked to speak to tge manager who wouldn’t come speak to us and finally found us a room in the old dated West Tower and the room was old dirty & decrepit!
30,There were very few restaurants in the Luxor and most were closed. The steakhouse closed!! The buffet and others closed at 3pm. So for dinner there only 2 to choose from except a small deli. The pool ran out of beer but fortunately the cabana server pulled through after I complained and found a dozen Coors Light for my husband in the casino somewhere. The lux was overall just a soso hotel. I will choose somewhere else next time.
30,Initial check-in was horrendous - extremely long wait and long line; After finally getting checked in the room was not clean at all - dirty towels on the bathroom floor dirty sheets on a bed that was not made up floor not clean. it was as if someone else had just checked out.
50,Great hotel with wonderful amenities. Easy access to conference location restaurants and entertainment. I did have to endure the smell of individuals constantly smoking illegal substances. Other than that I had an excellent stay.
20,Had to change rooms twice because of maintenance issues they were slow to respond. The first room the shower diverted was messed up so I called the desk and they didn’t answer went down and they switched rooms. The second the ac cut off by itself they were slow to respond and I lost about 4 hours of my vacation because the hotel did not wish to do maintenance
50,Awesome place to stay and gamble and several good restaurants on location rooms are clean and short distance to walk from room to casino pool and restaurants also close to Mandalay bay and Excalibur casinos
10,Not realy get a cheap reservations didn't get what I want next time be better deal with outside hotel room way to far from the front desk the bed way uncomfortable to lay on pillows way too soft like you don't have pillow at all.
50,After an undesirable and very late arrival to Vegas we were very happy to have the front desk staff be so welcoming helpful and accomodating to help improve the start of our trip. The front desk staff were friendly and helpful in getting us checked in and getting a late check out to allow us to sleep and shower upon arrival. Our room was clean and comfortable.
50,Room was very nice and close in proximity to the pool and lobby which was nice room was ready early which was very convenient to not have to leave luggage behind at the bell desk until it was ready. Excellent overall
50,I didn't know what to expect from the hotel but I was pleasantly surprised at how good it was! The beds and pillows are very comfortable and the rooms are a nice size. My only complaint is no in-room coffee maker but there are places on property to get coffee so it's not a deal breaker. Would definitely stay here again.
20,We had a very poor visit with the Luxor in September. Two couples were traveling together. Before we even left home I reserved two rooms in the Luxor for one night. When it came time to check-in I decided to do a mobile check-in. I could only check-in one of the rooms. I would have to check-in the other room at the front desk. We had a delightful time with the front desk person however she got names confused and we couldn't check into the other room until after 5pm while the four of us crashed in one room. Not a good experience.
50,Clean and beautiful place to stay. The helpful staff made the stay even more enjoyable. I loved the ease of checking in through the app. All around great experience. I will definitely be staying again.
40,One of the few themed casinos left on the strip. It's location is further down near the airport. It's connected by tram or walkway between Excalibur and Mandalay Bay. Stay in the pyramid portion for best experience. The rooms are average with the basics. No fridge or coffee maker. They have three pools and one hot tub. They got a buffet and a food court to eat. They have Bue Man Group and Carrot Top performing. Great casino and some bars and lounges. For a themed casino it was a fun place.
30,Room was fine for sleeping. Overall missing the general amenities of a fridge coffeemaker etc. Elevator was less than enjoyable and slow. Though I didn’t have to talk to any staff the one interaction I did have was not terribly pleasant and unhelpful. The hotel feels dark compared to others. It’s on the very south end of the strip so okay if all your activities are at that end. Overall it’s fine but would not book again.
30,This hotel is a little dated and could us a little updating. No refrigerators or microwaves in the room we had. The pool closed to early. and it takes along time to get janitorial service if you have an issue with your room like we did.
50,Everything was a success from the time that we arrived the staff was greeting and attentive. Everything is at Luxor don’t need to leave hotel great food restaurants and a food court box offices along with buffet. Great experience will come again.
20,The idea of living in a pyramid seemed exciting and the inclination that brings you to your room os an interesting novelty of the hotel. Once you get to your room beware! Pieces of toilet paper and tiny rocks (I hope) cover the floor so that I wore shoes if not in the tub. Even after asking for repeated vacuums they were still all over. My shampoo was open and half empty and interestingly I received new soaps everyday and each one was a different brand? Cleanliness is essential when you enter a hotel and this one never even got close to clean. On the bright side the sheets were clean and I wasn't planning on staying in the room that much (Thank goodness because they never DID get me a remote for the TV during my 4 day stay.)
50,Location right in the action. Easy to come from and get to airport. Trams made it easy to access more of the strip and there is a lot to see. Pool area and fitness room were clean and available. When quiet was needed the rooms were very comfortable.
10,It's cheap to stay and now we know why. It's old and gross. The casino seems well maintained but the rooms and access to rooms are old dirty and not well cared for. It's a long confusing walk from one part of the hotel to another finding a particular room number was challenging.
50,We wanted to try a different hotel while we stayed in Vegas and we were satisfied. Very friendly staff. I do wish the tvs in the hotel rooms had better channels or maybe even let us use the HDMI so that we could’ve plugged in our game console to be able to watch Netflix HBO or even Prime. But nonetheless we had had a great time.
10,Staff very rude place very dirty and run down location was ok attraction in the hotel were good even food court was ok but the hotel it self was very very dirty looks like we took a trip to 1995 and the sheet on bed were dirty as well
10,Extremely disappointed in my stay here. The price plus the amenities do not add up. Extremely dissatisfied. Would not recommend to anyone. Stay anywhere else. Hotel is dark smelly hole that is in bad need of updates and repairs. Pop machines on all floors are inoperable lights flickering in rooms that smell of mold
40,My wife and I enjoyed our stay at Luxor. Lots of fun things to do all around and they have a handy tram to get to the other nearby casinos. Staff is nice and the beds were comfy. Not as full of people as the middle of the strip which I liked.
50,Great place to stay with family. Traveled here with my wife and her family for a long weekend fun trip to Vegas. Appreciated the mobile app check in and the ability to use the app to get in and out of the parking garage. App also allowed you to go to the front desk skip the lines and get 4 additional key cards for those in the group that may not be as tech literate as you. Great food options and lots tables for blackjack craps and others. The Luxor is a bit off the main strip but a simple $10 Lyft to other locations on the main strip is all one needs.    Easy to read signs on where to go for the ride share/Uber/Lyft was also nice.    Would definently recommend. The only issue we had was the beds were slightly uncomfortable but that is also a hard thing to get just right as everyone is different and how they like the mattress.
40,the room was amazing the stay was fun the food was good but man they have to stop penny pinching and charging for a fridge . its 3 million degrees outside and you have to pay to keep your drinks cold? thats NOT HOSPITALITY thats nickle & dime'ing. you guys are better than this fix that and this place is Gold
20,Totally understand this is Vegas and people get drunk and party loud (been many times and stayed at many hotels) but have never felt unsafe in my room. We called security on 2 differnt instances. Once because women were screaming in the hallway sounding liek they were going to kill eachother and 2 because a drugged our man was banging on doors and moaning in the hallway. The bathroom was dirty there were stains on our pillow cases. Maybe they put people who get free rooms in the west tower because we stayed here a few years ago I believe in the easy tour and the rooms were much better and there were no security issues. If we could’ve checked into our room at the linq earlier we would’ve left that night. Also online check in was supposed to be easy and convenient but the electronic room key didn’t work for anything. Not for the parking pass I purchased or to take the elevator upstairs. We had multiple guests in the elevator let us know they had issues with their electronic key and the elevators as well and thag we should just go get a card. Super disappointed because we stayed at this hotel when we got engaged but honestly after this experience and even though it was free we will never stay here again.
50,Great place to stay very clean smells good people are nice except public sports bar Asian lady( greeting desk) very rude. Make sure you make reservations or otherwise get in line to be seated some thing the greeter does not tell you. Make sure you know what to do and what to expect otherwise she expects you to know it all.
10,Worst experience I have ever had!    Ive enjoyed playing and staying at MGM properties been a loyal player and was even able to reach platinum level at the MGM program a few years ago this experience really changes they way I feel about the properties and was really hoping that by speaking to a manger and even calling guest service I would get a better service/ response than it’s standard procedure now and you owe us money.    This is what happened to me  last night as we were a sleep I get a person banging on my door sounds like they want to break into my room. I jump off my bed and check the peep hole I can only see a man with a crowbar so I ask who is it and then I see a security stand in front of the door and say “security” I open the door and ask what they needed the security guard tells me someone called saying the room door was jammed and they were there to open it. Told them I didn’t call and the security laughs and says “guess we got the wrong room.” The security guards response was a bit upsetting so I call the front desk to complain them how they can just let’s security guard just try to break into someone’s room without asking for all the info I’m thinking how can they come to my room without asking the person who called for at least my full name. After 15-30 minutes on hold I finally speak to the front desk operator so Im explaining what just happened to me and basically cuts me off and tells me that i needed to update my credit card and had to go to the front desk asap. Keep in mind this is the middle of the night and I have always settled any charges when I check out so this was new to me. Since I’m still in a bit shock/upset because they way it seemed like they were breaking into the room I head down to the front desk There is a huge line and I didn’t want to wait in line for an hour since I was already asleep and had a flight the next morning so I headed back to my room. I don’t remember how long it was but I was already asleep again there is banging on my door but this time they do say it’s security before I get to the door. I open the door the 2 security guards say I needed to go down stairs to the front desk to update my card and would not be able to go back in my room if I didn’t .I tell them I’ll update it in the morning since I was asleep or if they can update or over the phone which they said I couldn’t. I get dressed and head down stair with the 2 security guards escorting me I get to the front desk and tell them I’m not waiting in that huge line and wanted to speak to a supervisor/manager because I found they put me in a very uncomfortable/inconvenient position. As I’m waiting for the manager I’m surrounded by 3 security guards now like if I’m a criminal now very embarrassing. The manger comes to talk to me Karla Casillas not the most friendly or courteous I’m getting explaining what happens to me with the security trying to break into my room to which she replies “ you owe us money that standard procedure “….BULLY TACTICS I’m surprised by her response thought she would be more understanding and courteous since she’s a manger and is working in customer service. As I tried explaining my frustration with the whole situation all she would reply is that I owed them money. At no point did I ever say I wasn’t going to pay and was treated like I stole something from her. Finally get my card updated and I don’t even get a generic response like sorry for the inconvenience she just told me “ payment went through you can go back to your room”. Worst experience I’ve ever had
30,Food court cleaning staff was rude. there wasn’t no fridge in room for my drinks. And I move notice lights water stain on the ceiling of my room. For the same money I got charge I could’ve stayed at a better hotel.
10,Worst experience I have ever had!  Long story short… been a long time player/customer at mgm properties. Was woken up in the middle of the night by security sounded like they were trying to break into my room all because they needed my credit card to get update. Didn’t want to update over the phone or wait until the next morning to update my card. Lost sleep and was embarrassed by having 3 security guards surround me while I updated my card info. Front desk manger felt what they did was appropriate because like she put it “ I owed them money”  Bully tactic .
10,My girlfriend and I stayed at the Delano and Mandalay Bay Hotels and loved them but our stay was over and we needed to check out. We wanted to stay in Las Vegas for a few more days so a friend of mine helped me book with the Luxor hotel thinking this nearby hotel would be similarly wonderful and welcoming but it was different at the Luxor Hotel. We booked for a few nights stay at The Luxor Hotel came to the front desk to check in early on 9/18 and I think her name was Rebecca told me she is from New York City and has family in Brooklyn. I thought we connected because we were both from New York she later bought out a heavy set woman named Kim who wore just a regular green T-Shirt. I found this woman more unprofessional and she told me my room wasn’t ready until 12pm and to go find a bench by the Uber and Lyft Taxi to sit there for 12 HOURS! Then warned me not to fall asleep because security will kick us out if we do fall asleep. What the hell? I am a paying guest and I have reservations for the Luxor Hotel. This wouldn’t be the case for Mandalay Bay or Delano Hotels where I previously stayed. Luxor Hotel treated me and my girlfriend who has Rheumatoid Arthritis like some third class citizens. We waited all night and all morning in the cold and smokey atmosphere and even got sick. I finally went went to talk to a manager named Martin who was kind enough to listen to my situation and promptly checked me and my girlfriend in at 8am. After a further exhausting hike to the room with no assistance we were greeted with a dusty room that smelled like bleach had no refrigerator (needed more medications) and no coffee/tea machine. Those are pretty standard in most hotels these days at the least.    I will NEVER be a guest at Luxor ever again even if the other option was to sleep on the sidewalk outside.
50,hotel was Close to airport and Allegiant stadium. Big and clean rooms. Fast check in. Express check out. Would definitely come back. They have great options for food. Servers at the cantina were all nice.
50,Very nice rooms and fairly priced. Would stay here again for sure. I booked through a third party website so there was a bit of confusion during my check in process but the front desk worker was very friendly and helpful in getting it taken care of.
20,No hot water the entire stay and elevators should come with a warning: enter at your own risk! We took the stairs more than elevators bc they would randomly stop working lines to get in them were way too long
30,Honestly I hope Luxor does something about this stay and I get reimbursed or a  Room in the future and I hope  They’re better. I understand that they’re busy but this is Vegas. Luxor should be prepared especially for concerts of this caliber. Just check your filters every month! It’s not hard.
20,Old ice water in the bucket 2nd day there we left to the strip and returned to an unvacuumed room full trash cans no soap nothing done! Except our beds and towels. We had to call room service when we arrived at 10:30 pm! waited an hour and finally had the trash taken and floors vacuumed.
20,Hotel is run down. Staff non existent on the casino floor. Was there for 6 days and maybe had 3 drinks served to me while gambling. Bathroom towel bar laying across toilet when we checked in. Buffet was never open for dinner. And only a few days a week for breakfast lunch.
20,The room rate were over priced. We were supposed to get 2 rooms comp with our malice rewards. but at time of check- out in websiteit wouldn’t give our comp nights. So when we got there the front desk person couldn’t explain to us why. So we went to the melífera reward center and they still couldn’t answer our questions. So we went to our rooms the first then we upgraded our room to corner suits. At first the rooms looked good but when we went into the bathroom one of the light bulb was out. The next morning we turned on the shower and the water was warm and the water from shower would fall out of the shower big safe hazard. I almost fell step into the shower. When we got back to our rooms after waking around all day long we walked in and realize that house keeping never come to cleaning our rooms. So we let it go and went to bed. The next went out again and come back at night and the same thing house keeping never showed up and we had no clean towels and toilet paper.  Went downstairs to the front desk and them know and the sent someone that dropped everything at our door. When at check out I told the front desk person what happened and they a least took off our resort fees and asked us if we would stay with them again. Never had so many problems at the hotel. We always loved to stay here.
20,bubbling. Sewer smell from shower drain. Didn't want to re-pack and move to another room. May not stay at Luxor again. Or go to a higher floor of I stay. Or get comped for next stay. There needs to be some construction near the street by the walkway to the parking lot.
40,If you want to GM relax by the pool in the shade bring a few extra 💵s. Don’t get me wrong we did pay for VIP at DayLigh. But for simply relaxing at the hotel pool with no entertainment I expect to have some shade.
40,My first problem was that the computer system was down and I could not pre check in. Not a big deal but when I arrived my MGM account number was in my reservation. Don’t know why but it was finally resolved. The elevator had issues and didn’t want to stop on the eleventh floor. My room could have been vacuumed better. I understand that service help is lacking right now. The Cafe was rather expensive and wasn’t up to previous standards and lacked quick service. Again maybe not enough staff.
40,Very expensive stay expensive food to eat inside. Really cool building inside and out. Nice pool! A little outdated carpet and chairs but nice room.  Wish breakfast was included but I know a lot of people would just walk up but cool building
30,Honestly the architecture of the building is breathtaking. The scenery is everything.    For me I think it's the smell. It reeks of old carpet with decades worth of smoke trapped inside.    Everything is overly priced but a great experience if you have the money or willing to branch out for something different.    My friend got stuck in the pyramid elevator our first night we were only in the hotel for 2 hours. But they made it up and switched our room to a tower suit.    Overall not too shabby but the smell will leave you with a bad taste in your mouth!
10,This was a poor experience. The room fixtures are very old signs inside the hotel for direction were of very little value and the distances to walk are very big. Luxor is inexpensive which is good for the budget vacationer but not so much for the business traveler whose time is very valuable. I would also have really appreciated in-room dining in the evening but it was available only in the morning.
10,One elevator was only working. 1 of the 4 elevators was only working and had to wait for 20 minutes to get in the elevator. When complained to management they did not seem to care and just said it would be fixed in the morning and guess what it was not fixed still working with one the elevator.
50,"The renovated basic rooms in the Pyramid are amazing. Sure it's hand me down furniture from the Bellagio but it's really nice furniture. The bathroom was nice. The shower head and water pressure were wonderful. Housekeeping was there when we removed the Do Not Disturb sign a couple of times over the week. The bed was comfortable and we slept great. I will happily stay in the Luxor Pyramid again in the future. For a ""lower end"" property it's unbeatable and feel's much more luxurious than the price point."
40,Nice overall friendly staff. I would have appreciated it more if they had better restaurant selection and quality of food. Also the smoke in the restaurant were very noticeable. I know it's a casino but they should do more to keep it away from where we eat.
30,The hotel was conveniently located and for those looking to casino hop it's perfect. Upon arriving checkin was seamless through the app. The directions in the app to find my room were slightly wrong but I found it without an issue with a longer journey to get there. The halls leading to the rooms had stained carpeting and tears in it. This combined with low lighting and a lack of staff or security cameras made the journey to my room feel like an 80's murder mystery movie. The room itself was very clean & attractive. The bed was comfortable & the room smelled fresh.
40,Checked into a Corner King at the Luxor on Sept 23rd. Even though it was on the back of the pyramid and on the low floor ( 4 ) I thought the room was great. It was very large clean and dark and quiet. Got a great nights sleep on the mattress. I would recommend this style of room for a romantic time as it has a soaker tub in the bedroom area.
10,I had multiple cockroaches in my room. While I did receive a new room it was absolutely repulsive to have a cockroach land on my neck in the middle of the night. Would not recommend anyone stay here.
50,Great stay and excellent food and beverage choices staff friend and helpful there is a walk way to Mandalay Bay and this made it easy to get back and forth to the conference. Gaming area was help and the Starbucks opened at 4am
40,Room was very clean bed very comfortable. It's a bit close to the airport but planes stop coming in around midnight. Tram right in front of the front door going to the strip and hotel was also connected to the Mandalay Bay via walkway. Pool was clean but nothing fancy.
10,We alerted staff day one that the plumbing in our room wasn’t working. We had to cancel plans and wait on maintenance to come for over an hour. Water was gurgling up the pipes in the bathroom and it smelled like sewer. Day two no one ever came. Same on day three. We cut our trip short and was refunded $250 and we spent hours trying for help. No one ever offered a room and management was a jerk for assuming $240 of a $800 bill was enough of a refund to make a difference for the terrible stay we had in our suite.
30,Not the best MGM property as it’s of the older ones but I love the location! The room never cooled off and the toilet would make a gurgling noise every night (I’m sure the plumbing is just old but it was loud enough to wake me up)!
30,The check in process was long I do understand the hotel was busy. The lady at the front desk was not rude but not very nice.  We are excited to be there and the staff not so excited to have us. I prefer people interaction verses using apps. But maybe if there is a next time I will use the app instead to avoid staff.
20,First off check beforehand to see if there are any events going on. I was required to park in valet because the self parking garage was closed due to an event. Valet parking easily took half an hour. Once I finally arrived I had checked into the app on my phone. Had the floor and room number got all the way to the elevators and the app would no longer work. I ended up having to wait in line at check in to get a tangible keep so I could get to my room. I had reservations at a restaurant in the hotel that night and needed to reschedule twice because of how uncoordinated check in was. The room was fine during our stay. We were there two nights. In the app I opted out of room service since we weren't staying long. After the first night we got a knock on our door for housekeeping. They let themselves in when we were indisposed. What is the point of being able to opt out if housekeeping and a plastic room key if either of those options are not actually available? Very frustrating and would not stay here again. Disappointing as the steakhouse and casino was great.
50,Their staff is great friendly and get things done. Housekeeping was also friendly and asked if we needed anything. I would definitely come back to this hotel and stay here. Best experience ever in las vegas
30,Hotel provided the necessary means to enjoy Vegas but did not wow me on customer service and cleanliness. Great restaurant and shows located at this resort. I think their elevator system needs upgrading and a new layout to enjoy the pool. Seems crowded and awkward.
20,Is a Vegas hotel but overpriced. Have stayed at many MGM and so far the Vdara is my favorite. I will pick another hotel in the future. Remodeled rooms but basic and you have to rent a fridge and there are no coffee makers or anything extra in the room. Do not stay here for the view. The food at Public House is good! The buffet was expensive which was expected except the food was bland and cheap tasting.
50,Interior is very nice the pool was amazing not many food places. The room had an old smell other than that it was very clean I had an amazing visit will returning with friends or family. The pool amazing
30,Pricey for the type and location of our room. Basic room at 300/nite  Zero view on first floor. We got unlucky I guess. We asked to be switched to another room even before arriving since we had done the mobile check and were told it was possible
10,Overall cheap feel.    No Check-In people available (all days we were there).    Both rooms on separate floors smelled musty and disgusting.    Not a fun place.    I’m putting low effort into this review as I don’t them to waste any more of my time. If they cared about fixing it they would read my survey results.
50,Super cool place to stay! Love the gym and pool experience as well with the whole tractions they have around the area. You’ll never get bored always so much to do and overall great experience. Highly recommend!
50,Back for end of summer stay at the luxor always use mobil check in it makes for beating the line Pool for three days Pool host Miquel servers Jessie Brittney and Tony made it the funnest stay yet Highly recoomend spending the day at the pool deck Casino floor was busy but servers Bonnie Crystal kept our glasses full.
30,"The accommodations were nice but not great. It would of been great to have a refrigerator available in our room. I have never stayed at a hotel that didn't have a refrigerator in it since the early 90's...  The elevators looked like they hadn't been cleaned since the 80's also. Every one of the little doors for the emergency phones or whatever is in them were all broken and hanging open with graffiti in them. Not something you want to see in a ""nice"" hotel.  When we went to the pool there was only one pool open. The nice pools around the center area were not open. We planned on staying the whole day there at the pool in our cabana but we ended up leaving early to go back to our room.  It wasn't a horrible stay and there were some highlights (Carrot Top Tender Steakhouse) but not enough to make us stay here again."
50,We had an amazing experience at the Luxor! The rooms were beautiful and clean. There were air purifiers in the rooms which kept the smokey smell from the casino at nonexistent. The restaurants and nearby options were amazing. We were able to find food for everyone in our party at all times. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful. We had the best time and the casino wins we pretty good as well. It wasn't as hype and crowded as some of the other hotels which we liked. We really enjoyed and would definitely stay here again!
50,Great hotel to stay at and the location is perfect! Walking distance to most major attractions. Allegiant stadium is a short 15 minute walk and the rooms are very clean with comfortable beds. Price is good for the rooms
40,This is one of the older hotels that we visited more than ten years ago but decided to give them another try based on such a great per night price. The staff was friendly and efficient however there was nothing really special about our room.
40,We stayed in a corner king suite. It was fresh and clean. Had been updated recently but the age still showed in some of the furniture (missing a handle on a drawer) and the soaking tub. The windows were dirty. We didn't have a DND sign in the room or a list of Luxor amenities and attractions. It's like they cleaned the room but forgot to put out the literature. Which is fine. It's not a big deal.    The digital keys are super hit and miss as is wifi and cell signal in the hotel. We just had to go get actual keys made at the mobile check in station. Which was a pain but again it's fine.    We had zero interaction with any Luxor staff. I don't know if that's good or bad but that's how it played out. My wife did call for room service to refresh our towels in day 3 but they never did. Again we were fine. Minorly inconvenienced but fine.
20,The room smell like wet dog and the carpet was wet when we arrived. It was very disappointing as I’ve been in the Luxor before and had a better experience. Honestly I was way too tired to even complain but the smell got worse through the night into the morning.
10,This was the worst hotel I’ve ever been to. We received the incorrect room at check in even though we had reserved our room months in advance. The front desk staff argued with us when asked to see the manager. The internet never worked. There is no cell service in there. The systems crash daily. The housekeeping removes or takes items and leaves the trash on counters after taking the bag from the garbage. Overall this hotel is like staying in a motel on the strip. Never again…
20,You get what you pay for apparently. Hotel is old and dated. AC didn’t work in room. I would look for somewhere else to stay next time. No room service and the shower head leaked. It was at least close to where my event was but I would stay somewhere else next time.
30,The room was well appointed and clean. We had numerous problems with our reservation. And it didn’t seem like there was enough staff to handle the number of guests. Check in line was several hundred people deep whenever we went by (and kept us from trying to iron out issues.) Calling was no better with horrendously long hold time before talking to anyone.
10,Stay here if you want a bed on the cheap. Not the best rooms nor service. Expect to not have hot water or drinking water. Most of the time you cannot get anyone on the phone to help you. The whole experience was way below expectations and not good at all
10,didn’t have hot water in my room all day Friday or Saturday morning. When I brought it up to the desk I explained that I wasn’t asking for anything for free but would like to switch to a room with working hot water. The desk told me the problem “should” be fixed and that they would comp me $40 for the inconvenience. $40 on a $500 a night room. When I got back home to Texas and tried to call in to get ahold of someone in management to discuss a more reasonable comp I got pinballed around from one department to another disconnected several times couldn’t get anywhere. my room also didn’t have a microwave mini fridge or any complementary water bottles. Absolute joke for a supposed luxury hotel. I will strongly recommend against staying there to anyone who ever asks.
50,I had fun playing the slots and enjoying them as interactive video games that paid dividends. I bought a cross that was $7500 and topped mine wors it with my gold American Bald Eagle medallion. Gold is the secret to winning a Vegas Casino. Everyone wears it there for luck. Men's jewelry is a must for a Vegas casino. Have fun in Los Vegas!
40,My stay was pleasant. The location was great and transportation in area was easy. Food prices were a little high but I guess due to Covid everything has changed. P. S. I think the advertisements on the Pyramid take away from the beauty of the Luxor. I remember when it was blank. It looked really great.
30,They overbooked king rooms so I got a queen one despite having a confirmed reservation for king. The swimming pool closes at 6pm which is outright ridiculous - my family was super disappointed and we decided to gamble elsewhere to not reward MGM for such a shady behavior. Rooms lack basic amenities like fridge or microwave (because people staying at 4 star hotels just tend to throw out leftovers it seems). The breakfast buffet is expensive but has a good variety of food. The whole casino area smells like cigarettes. Overall while this is in line with other resorts in Vegas it's just not up to the standard.
10,Horrible spot to anything else on the strip air didn't work internet didn't want to connect or hardly worked anywhere in the building. Mold and mill dew and got bite while sleeping and walking in the room
20,I was in Vegas for an event not to party. My room was on the ground floor by the elevators. I'm a pretty sound sleeper but I was getting woken up about every 5-10 minutes all night long by high heels clicking on the hard tile surface from the lobby to elevators. Then I would hear loud talking yelling and the occasional screaming in pain. I wish I was kidding but this litterally happened on 2 differnt occasions for about 10 mins straight I stepped out my room at one point to ask a member of the hotel staff what was going on and she shrugged it off like it was normal. She said someone had an issue with anxiety or something in broken english. Hey people have problems sometimes if this was all that happened I'd understand. I think that was just the icing on the cake so to speak. My interactions with the hotel staff was exceptional. Room was nice but not as clean as I would expect for a resort hotel. Location was on 2 mile from Thomas and Mack center.
20,Title says it all. Spend a few more bucks and go to a decent hotel. Couldn't sleep because I could hear every sneeze toilet flush and people in the hallway at all hours. Bathrooms dirty mold and hardly any light in the room for working.
50,Great place to stay for conference next door at Mandalay next door. Room was clean and had no issues at all. While it’s not a top of the line resort Luxor definitely fills a need for those looking for a more budget friendly option.
40,The hotel it’s self is great. Casino was big staff was great doesn’t have good beer selection. Elevators are sketchy. Room was big and the water pressure was fantastic. Biggest regret was riding the elevator feels like it’s going to break down every time you ride it
50,The room was excellent except for the television not working. The staff was very friendly the value for the room was exceptional. I plan on making a trip in 2023 for a friend's 70th birthday and will be booking another pyramid suite
20,The employees were exceptional. The “resort” would be shown up by most 7 out of 10 star rated Super 8 motels. The difference? There is no “resort fee” at Super 8 and the coffee/breakfast is free. Also no $18 parking fee… just sayin’!
10,The hotel feels very old the rooms were not the most comfortable. It feels like a third world hotel the escalators on the way to NY NY were all not working. It was definitely not worth the price. I will not repeat stay.
50,We had our company's meeting at the Luxor; great great experience. EXCELLENT customer service and met all of our needs. Linlin with meetings Nick and Bonnie with A/V and Kathy were all great! Highly recommend them
10,The hotel is dirty; rooms are not cleaned daily air never while stayed; our bed was made but never vacuum the carpet the bathroom was never cleaned there never leave shampoo or soap had to ask for it; it smells; I will never in my whole life stay in that hotel in my life or recommend to my family and friends
30,Average property. Very slow to non existent drink service on the casino floor. AC was broken in our room so it was muggy and impossible to be comfortable. The food options were good. Plenty of different options. Overall I was ok with our stay but it could of been better
10,Someone opened the door when my wife was getting dressed at 9am. So even if you lock from inside employees can come in at anytime. Room was ok  it was clean except for the orange sofa it needs a good cleaning.
30,Beautiful lobby good restaurants excellent show with Blue Man Group but very poor housekeeping service and half of the front desk staff was not friendly. One manager was great in his service to help us with housekeeping.
10,Stay somewhere nice and secure. This place is old dirty and not secure! Smells the casino has scammers and security is not helpful. Homeless people outside. Rooms are outdated and smell like sewer. Stay away!
30,We enjoyed our trip but feel it could have been better. They appeared to be short staffed and our bathroom was not very clean. There was a 40.00 resort fee that we had to pay for each day we stayed there but for a reduced cost it was open to the public so I kept asking myself why I had to pay a larger resort fee than the general public did.
50,I came to Vegas for my mothers 60th birthday and we loved it. It was so much to do in the hotel from swimming pools restaurants and staff was very friendly and help us find others places to shop on the strip
40,Customer service was great and access to Allegiant Stadium only a short walk. Lots of Raiders fans over the weekend and they were all a lot of fun. Great shows in the Casino with lots of good places to eat!
30,We received a discounted rate for an event we attended so for that price it was decent. Would not have been happy paying full price. Didn't have any hot water when we first arrived most key scans in the elevators were broken and had very dim lighting in the room. The location was great for our stay though and the staff was amazing. Casino area was very clean and open as opposed to some of the others we visited. Beds and shower pressure were good. No issues with checking in/out on the app.
40,Really enjoyed out trip. Spent 4 days at Luxor. From the time we checked in till we left friendly staff easy check in and check out great service nice clean rooms decent places to eat bus stop close by.
10,"I have a laundry list of issues.    The Luxor does not have ANY body wash in the property other than Womens body wash for purchase at the 24/7 store. Totally inconsistent with other MGM properties.    Online check in was broken. The woman at the check in desk told me it ""never works""    The room phone had all of this gross crusty stuff on it. has not been cleaned in potentially months or years. Totally gross.    Leaf blowers outside my window near the palm trees in the front. waking me up 630 AM PST.    Wifi was slow and difficult to connect to in my room.    Shower water was spraying water everywhere. The design of the shower is silly and allows for tons of water to leak into the floor. On Saturday and Sunday morning the water pressure dropped drastically and water went cold.    Elevators take forever they are slow and only 2 were inservice for the first 3 days. then 3 came into service.    Dirty windows the windows were really really dirty and hard to see out of. the outside of the luxor was visibily ""brown"" up close not black.  3am one morning a large truck was backing up and beeping outside of my window.    No concierge on the property they told me to walk to another hotel for a concierge? ridiculous.    No in room dining.    Elevator lobby was tiny with a fight to get in each elevator. Full elevators Not covid safe at all. Nothing like that happened at the aria EVER. I never had to wait for elevators or fight to get in.    Vomit in elevator one day - not your fault but still gross. Was cleaned up quickly    There was a random blood stain on the chair in the room.    The paint on the walls was peeling the ceiling vents were missing or broken all throughout the hotel."
10,Horrible experience would never go back worst place I have ever stayed at . Horrible experience with manager Carla this women should not even be working here not having any customer service experience. Incompetent employees in this place. I was given a room with broken faucet in the bathroom. Also I was downgraded from the room I had reserved online  this people have old pictures of their rooms online when the rooms no longer look like the pictures. False advertising all the way. This place should not be conducting business should close. Would not recommend to family or friends and will be uploading all the videos I have proving all this false advertising they have. People save your money and don’t book with Luxor.
30,I love the Luxor. It is my go to Hotel for Las Vegas. Just a few things stuck out that soured this trip    Got my room and was facing a wall.    Had a broken chair at the in room table.    The rooms Lounge area wasn't 100% when entering. The tv stand was pushed aside and un plugged. We found out the control didn't work. Batteries or broken remote couldn't check but had to unplug it to be quite.    Went for late breakfast/early lunch at the buffet. We were told it was breakfast and lunch at the time.  We get there and it is lightly stocked with minimal options and minimal lunch food options. Looked like a jazzed up golden corral.
20,Noisy rooms and pests in room... cockroach will not stay there again...I have stid at the MGM properties alot...so far that was the worst experience.The staff was good and friendly. Escalators were not working.
10,We arrived at midnight and werent given a room key until 4am. The front desk had us wait in a 3 hour line which was them telling everyone that there were no rooms and that we had to wait an unknown amount of hours until they would be ready. The staff were cranky they offered no help for my breast feeding wife.... avoid avoid avoid
30,It had a smell of wet carpet plus it was beyond cold the AC never turned off... we will turn it off and it was back on 3min later. Other comments mention similar things we just didn't pay attention to them. Learn our lesson
10,I have stayed at this hotel several times and have never had a issue until last time. Upon arrival I paid extra for a 3pm late checkout fee. The morning I checked out they rudely knocked on my door several times at 11 am then busted open my room when I had the do not disturb sign and had already paid for late checkout.. Then when I went to checkout they charged me a $300 smoking fee and I don’t even smoke! The people I spoke with at the front desk were very rude and I felt racially profiled. I have never smoked in a hotel room it is very greedy and unprofessional of them to charge me a $300 fee for smoking when I never smoked in the hotel room and I don’t even smoke at all.
20,Service and the casino/restaurant areas were nice. Our major issue was the sound in the rooms. The walls are so thin that you can hear absolutely everything in the neighboring rooms from conversations to people sneezing… nice place to visit the casino and restaurants but we will not be staying there again as we were very sleep deprived.
40,We enjoyed our stay the staff were great. Rooms weren’t bad. Housekeeping kept up. Front Desk was on top of things if we called down for anything extra.    We called for a mini fridge it was $25 but that’s not bad for the week!    Good bang for your buck!
20,Mobile checking didn’t work and upon arrival I was told I had to wait in the huge line not even offered an apology they just said “sometimes it happens…we don’t know why” I was charged for parking but key didn’t work so had to pay more at other MGM resorts I was told they would reimburse me but they didn’t…also rooms show wear :(
10,Do yourself a favor book a different hotel. The hotel is run down dirty poor service terrible amenities no customer service too far from other casinos terrible views and lousy food choices with terrible hours.
50,Me and my fiance stayed 4 days to attend a Raider Game very convenient the walk was about 10 minutes. Loved the cleanness and comfort stay. Every one really friendly! Room service was amazing. I trusted all my personal items with room staff!
20,The staff is not the friendliest. The room was not the cleanliest. I looked for information and was met with an attitude. The location was inconvenient. Food options were for the most part extremely unhealthy. But the worst thing was the lack of attentiveness to the issues that I did have. I’m not gonna sit there and complain after I’ve assessed the level of service I would be receiving. But an honest review I shall
50,Clean rooms great view if we needed supplies it was quickly handled. Check-in was very slow though. The pool closed very early in afternoon we were not happy! I mean it was still Summer and we are in the dessert!
30,I love to come to Vegas to sit by the pool. Luxor offers 4 pools but on this beautiful weekend only 1 pool was open... for no apparent reason. The one pool that was open was filthy and crowded! On the positive I was upgraded to a tower room which was very clean and large. If a room is all you want... this hotel is a great choice!
10,When I arrived at the hotel the check in line was really long. I opted to check in online and get key less entry I was assigned a horrible room on the first floor right by the elevators. It was really noisy all night and I didn't get much sleep. I asked to change rooms and they wouldn't change my room. I should have waited in the long line!
40,Great experience clean rooms amazing service. Easy check out process valet was super easy and convenient. Had lost my ticket for valet and was super easy fix and still quick service! can’t wait to come back!
30,No water in 2st room and there was hair in shower and makeup on hand towel sticky stuff on nightstand. Got downgraded to a 1970s style room that hadn't been renovated. Finally git a better room the 3rd time but had no hot water twice
30,Never received a text confirming our room was ready I checked after 4:15pm and it was ready! Don’t tell us that we will rcv a text and you don’t text us! Hotel room was dirty countertop was very sticky table where you eat was dirty and bathroom floor was sticky
40,The location is convenient to get around for events and entertainment even without ride share or Taxi. Connections to a couple of Casinos plus the casinos those were connected to by bridged hallways. All in all good stay. Only complaint is that it was pricey.
50,Nice and clean. A lot of amenities and walking distance to alligiant stadium. Great food bars and shows. Easy access to near by casinos. Staff was very friendly and helped with any questions I had for them.
10,In this day in age to experience rampant smoking in the casino and stores was awful. I’m allergic to some tobacco and additives and I had more breathing problems than I’d ever experienced anywhere else. Super gross all the way round
30,Need to update room no coffee maker no fridge tv image very poor. Window shades difficult to open and close. In general ok for the price but needs updating for a better room experience for example USB ports. Elevator difficult to operate scanner on one side faulty.
40,We were on a family vacation in July and we had chosen this hotel. It is a bit far from downtown Las Vegas but it is a nice hotel with spacious and clean rooms. Easy to take different transports. we really liked it a lot. We were struck by the inclined elevator to reach the 21st floor where our room was.  Perhaps the check-in time can be improved because we last almost 45 minutes for the line.
40,This is where your able to gamble and be with other Raider fans. I enjoy the slot machines and the food. I would like to continue coming here. It helps if we can check in earlier than 3 pm. The front desk needs to listen to our concerns when registering. That's all I have for now. We go to Vegas often and want to have a nice experience from begging to the end. I never saw so many angry people waiting in line again because the system went down. When they had registered using the Mobile app.
50,Service was excellent. Hotel was clean staff very friendly. Whenever I had a question or needed assistance the staff was very helpful. I would highly recommend this hotel to any of my friends. Very convenient of your attending a Raider game
10,Valet is average of twenty min rate and your charged for the valet and they expect to be tipped. Then when you give a thirty dollar tip to be parked up front they park you in the north forty and then charge you thirty dollars for valet parking.  Charging for a mobile no fridge is ridiculous for this Name brand of resort. Beds are old and worn. This is not a typical MGM property that is for sure.
30,Pyramid rooms are a waste of money. No fridge(unless you rent it) no tub (go to the dirty pool and hot tub if you want to soak). Rooms are far from the elevator (can we say leg day everyday) Won’t be back.
20,Why oh why didn’t I read the reviews?!! I’m sorry ya’ll it’s 2022 so if you don’t have coffee in the room and a mini fridge you are worse than Motel 6. Boo. I should have gone with my first instinct and stayed at the Marriott.
10,I’m more apt to write a positive review than negative but felt compelled here. I’m staying at the Luxor for a work event and this is legit one of the nastiest rooms I’ve ever stayed in. The Luxor in general is aged but aged can still be clean. Walked into my first floor room which reeks badly of smoke and a comfy 80 degrees. Further inspection found the bathroom was never cleaned. Seems like the original mattresses too. Called the front desk and they’re fully booked but allegedly someone would come look at the malfunctioning ac (it’s been hours). First time I have felt the need to shower after stepping out of the shower this room is so gross. Stay away - there are run-down motels cleaner than this.
20,Not staying in this hotel never again and I don’t recommend it to anyone if you want to have a great time at Vegas I got changed from room 2 times because they had issues I had rooms with bad views hotel is not clean I really has a bad experience
10,The Luxor is an old outdated overpriced hotel and in my particular case even got a room that smelled like marijuana. It is poorly managed because I tried there valet service and it was super slow restrooms are dirty and about half of their urinals were out of service when I was there not to mention not having paper towels to dry hands.
30,This is a great location but the hotel is in disrepair. Rooms don't look or feel clean. Carpet and paint would do a lot of good. The resort is dark and really has no identity. Coukd use an updated theme and face lift.
20,If you are only looking for a bed...it was OKAY. If you wanted any help from the staff...God help you. IF you find one expect to be treated as a burden. Check in and check out are horrible. They are going to phone check in and key...didn't work. Everyone I saw trying to use their phone as a key in the elevator...couldn't. Seek help? Good luck.
20,Property very run down. No place to eat late night except for the deli.  Casino floor very crowded. there was some type of special entertainment in the casino that was very loud (like a concert) that went on for hours. Too bad if you liked it or not. I understand that there is live music but all night long?I was there to play not to listen to drunks all evening. Don't try to call guest services for anything important as I was on hold for 15 minutes and hung up. Next time I called I was on hold for 10 but they did finally answer and after the person checked with the manager 5 times I was able to get a different room as the one I was in had no hot water. I was supposed to have a limo to the airport and when I checked (had to go to the front desk and wait in a very long line) to verify the pick up time I was told it was scheduled for the next day not the day I was leaving. So I was given a number to contact dispatch myself...as I said great guest services. They were all booked so I had to take a taxi. Don't stay there!
40,Walking distance (10-minutes) to Allegiant stadium for the Las Vegas Raiders football game. They have some good shows Bodies Blue Man Group as well as connected to Mandalay Bay. However it is far from the center of the strip so you will be doing a lot of walking or rideshares.
20,"I was given a beautiful room with a beautiful view then I got a phone call that I had to move rooms because the one I was in needed to undergo ""maintenance"" I was moved to a room that actually needed maintenance paint in the restroom and with a terrible view of hotel roof of nothing but pipes it ruined my stay."
10,Unfortunately housekeeping stole my items and management was dismissive. The managers name is Mark don't expect him to help or be empathetic to any of your issues.    The Luxor security guard Yolanda was the most helpful employee at Luxor. Yolanda made me feel heard and offered a food voucher which is more than I can say for management.
40,The room had low airflow which made it hard for us to sleep. Long wait time to check in but room was nice and clean. We had no problems during our stay. Staff was able to point us in the right direction when we asked for help.
40,Easy to navigate the hotel and casino areas.  Good variety of dining areas - restaurants and fast food.  Short distances to rooms with quick moving elevators.  Nice choices for entertainment and shopping.
10,Great location if you need to be in the south strip. The processes are horrible. The rooms are bad. The staff is rude. If you need to be in the south strip and you have low expectations - this could be your spot. The final straw was when the maid tapped twice at 9:00 AM and immediately unlocked the door with the handle up to lock it. Apparently it was my fault for not having the do not disturb sign on the door. The check in app was having problems so everyone had to stand in a ridiculously long line to check in. This place has a lot of potential. It looks like they have decided to go low cost low touch and low service. Rooms were beat up with peeling paint and questionable carpet. I kept my socks on the entire time.
50,Location is pretty far south on the strip is really the biggest con I could think of a person may have. I preferred the location and had an excellent experience I will be back whenever I can get the leave time built up :)
30,Moving sidewalks to and from Excalibur mostly not working and occasional escalator and elevators not working. They should do better than this.  Room was fine and overall hotel was clean even if in need of a refreshing.
50,First time in Vegas and had Great service and room was very clean! Very satisfied with everything. Had a really great time with my wife and would really love to come back sooner rather than later. Uber and taxis was organized as well.
20,For a 29 year old Hotel it has the wear and tear of a 80 year old Motel. Finishes are old and stale Suites are not worth the extra money because everything is worn out. AC worked great no room service after 5pm. No way to heat leftover food in your suite. Luxor too cheap to put a microwave in your suite. Hotel is at the end of the strip.
20,Room had a marijuana smell especially in the bathroom . Was double charged for parking. Billing phone number doesn’t work. Email and still waiting for a response. Hopefully will be taken care of soon.
10,Our shower flooded (called and was told it would be fixed day 1 - was never resolved). Elevator didn’t read card properly and we missed our floor even after scanning. Buffet was very underwhelming. Food was spilled in hallway and sat for over 24hrs before it was cleaned up. Trash was the same.
30,For the price point there's much better. Rooms are rather dated and the AC barely worked. I had to get up several times during the night to get the AC to kick itself back on. Fixtures were quite dated and the USB port on my side of the bed was inop.
10,The rooms were small and not well appointed. No coffee maker in the room no refrigerator. The linens were small and scratchy. The beds were uncomfortable. The A/C unit did not cool the room. The hotel layout was difficult to maneuver. The hotel elevators were like a maze to get to your spot.
50,The hotel is very beautiful and the staff was very nice just hard to get ahold of someone over the phone and the lobby was always busy to talk to anyone the room wasn’t what I ask for or requested the all u can eat buffet the food was cold and cups was dirty
50,Check in was awful. We arrived just after 10pm exhausted and stood in line for over 90 minutes. Our check in was really fast so not sure why the staff were so slow with everyone before us.    Besides that our stay was pleasant. Room was clean enough. Fresh towels and cleaned every day. Even had a welfare check because we put do not disturb for 2 days (we were getting married so wanted peace)    Casino seemed busy.
50,My stay at the Luxor was good it is a very big Hotel. It was my sister's birthday and she is in the army Me and my other sister my niece my cousin and three of my sister's friends stayed there. My room was nice needed a good vacuum besides that the it was comfortable.
10,I haven’t stayed at Luxor in over 10 years. It was bad back then. I booked with the MGM reservation line and I was told the hotel had been remodeled.  It may have been lightly remodeled but it’s still dingy and dirty. There’s definitely better places to stay for the same price.
40,Casino was very clean. Room seemed to have a remodeled bathroom and new carpets. Paid for early check-in but did not get into the room until almost 2. Safe in room was locked upon arrival and there was no remote for the TV but this was rectified pretty quickly through housekeeping.
10,Rooms were very dirty. Carpet was filthy and everything was dusty. Housekeeping did not show up to clean our rooms at all during our stay even though we asked the lady to clean our rooms. We had to call them to come take out trash and to get fresh towels. Not staying there again
30,The front desk staff did move us immediately but it was an inconvenience since we had our vow renewal scheduled that afternoon. Our new room didn't have hot water for a day and a half. Overall it was a good stay.
20,If you have a problem with your room keep your expectations very low. Had a leak from the AC. The room smelled heavily of mold and mildew. Called customer service for maintenance request to fix or change rooms. Nothing was ever done about it and I never heard from anyone about the situation. Won't be back
30,Room cleanliness was not there our toilets didn't flush sink clogged and soap scum and mold on bathroom walls huge turn off scheduled 1 night in this hotel to get a premium experience and was highly disappointed. Staff entered our room 3 x after 1 knock brought up to the attention of front desk.
30,I’m on the fence about Luxor. It’s so beautiful but the rooms are so dated or at least my pyramid room was. I honestly never care about things like this.. but it’s like stepping back in the 90’s in the rooms. A simple changing of the carpet would do a world of good in my opinion. There’s no USB ports in the room that I found. I thought there was no safe but it’s in the nightstand. That being said my room was clean and was kept clean during my stay. Head towards Public House to get to the exist that takes you to the tram…that will shorten the long walk to anything else on the Strip. I probably would stay here again.
50,We had the best time gambling at the Luxor. The staff is so friendly when playing the table games. Melinda Harris was such a nice and hospitable Pit Boss. She got to know us by first name and always welcomed us back. I think the Luxor has really improved since the last time I visited. They have some good shows and it was very clean. I highly recommend staying here.
30,Not satisfied at all! No one came and cleaned my room the entire time I was there. Did not like the inclinator. Wasn’t happy with if you were on the other side of the hotel you had to walk a country mile to get to the inclinator
50,Clean great rooms. Amazing pyramid experience . Will definitely be back the pools where amazing great open spaces and the connection to the Excalibur made it easy to travel back and forth . Loved the whole trip .
50,We had a fantastic stay at The Luxor! The rooms are very clean and the staff was courteous and kind. We will definitely be returning to stay again! Still one of my favorite spots. The first time I stayed here I was 21. Now I am 43. How time flies!
10,The rooms are extremely dated. The furnishings are old didn't have any conditioner or soap in the room it smelled musty and a little like marijuana and the room was in the upper 70's when I checked in.    The first room I checked into had a leaky toilet and I had to move to a second room (described above).
20,The hotel and the rooms are run down. The furniture and bathroom need major updates. The bed was comfortable though. The walls are paper thin - you hear everything in the adjacent rooms. Internet super slow and the TV fades in and out.
10,"2 hours 20 minutes waiting in check in line to find out no rooms were available EVEN IF you had a reservation! Then told they were waiting for room cleaners to be completed (at 2:30 AM ""come on"") but because they were union there was no way to know when the rooms would be ready! OH they did expect you to check out by 11:00AM no matter what time your room became available"
40,There are a lot of reviews about this hotel online some of them not so nice. It is an older property but it was clean and comfortable. It is also amongst the lowest priced options available on the Las Vegas strip. The resort fee of $35 is a pain as I believe these are just ways to collect more without providing a whole lot in return. However the Wi-Fi in our room and around the property seem to connect seamlessly but it’s not worth $35 a day.
50,Dramatic hotel in pyramid shape and great location on strip. Price best on strip. But room very smoky. Nicely appointed. Need better more healthy restaurant selection. Would stay again but ask if have a non-smoking room.
30,First time at this property and was not impressed at all. The property definitely needs alot of renovations and customer service training for their housekeeping staff. The staff in the Pyramid Cafe werel pleasant.
10,Too disgusting to even get into it  But truly the worst hotel experience of my life. Never again. Even if it was free. Just beyond words. Too many issues for 200 words. There are better options in Vegas
10,Luxor has gone down hill. Dirty  Old broken down elevators. No refrigerators in room and they charge $25 to rent one! If you give them your parking ticket upon check in its automatically billed to your room and they could care less if you are an mgm  Member with a level that gets free parking. Last time staying here.
40,The Canelo fight and 16 de septiembre brought in a lot of people but Luxor pulled through. Comped room plus $100 resort credit and $$ free play. Service was great and they honored by requests no questions asked. Housekeeping did an excellent job and my room was quiet when I needed rest.
50,We stayed in one of the more expensive rooms as a treat to ourselves to some relaxing. I assumed it was jacuzzi tub but was actually not. Still good for a bubble bath! The only thing I didn’t like was mobile check in. We had too many problems and your phone key does not work in the elevators.
10,If you are looking for somewhere cheap to stay and you don’t care about customer service or cleanliness then this is the place for you. The walls are paper thin. I could hear every word of the conversation the people next door were having. You will get lost. This place doesn’t believe in navigational signs. The rooms are not cleaned. Be prepared to walk into a room with the previous person’s dirt and trash. I talked to a woman staying in another room and she told me her room had food from a previous occupant. My mobile key wouldn’t work. I got stuck in a elevator with another person who’s mobile key didn't work. Luckily they had a physical key. However I didn't. So I was trying for 20 minutes just to get to my floor. Also everywhere was sticky.
30,The room was clean and the pillows were amazing. Other than that it’s just an average hotel. We did end up checking out early because we had a leak in the ceiling of our bathroom. However there were no other rooms available for them to move us to and the dripping noise drove us crazy
20,In the MGM Family I would stay elsewhere every time. From outdated rooms to poor dining choices there are definitely better places to stay on the strip. Room rates were definitely higher than the experience was worth.
50,They always take care of me and keep a clean hotel. Great service friendly and courteous staff all the way around. Buffet was delicious and so were the restaurants. Fairly priced and definitely plan on returning soon!
50,Was a great first experience in Vegas can't wait to go back to experience everything I missed. Definitely a little rough around the edges some places but that's expected. The city had charm and character.
50,Once a year I bring a grandchild that turns 21 and some that older . They always have a great time and they always want to know when I am going back cause they want to came with me they know I can't say no tothem
30,Resort fees no fridge or coffee pot and to ask to help with carbon footprint by not having room and towels clean during your stay is a lot to swallow. Also charge for early and late check in or check out is pushing the envelope.
40,Cleanliness on the strip beautiful view and loooved the jacuzzi inside the room which is next to the window with a nice view out to the strip. The bed was very comfortable. Will definitely be coming back with family.
40,Always a great location. The rooms are reasonably priced. The self parking is not easily accessed. The front bar BADLY needs new furniture but the bar tenders are great. Market place snacks WAY overpriced. 3 times or more what you would pay at 7/11. Staff very friendly.
20,Stayed at the Luxor to attend a concert. Don't let the reasonable room prices fool you you get to pay additional resort fees the moment you check in $70 to park for 2 nights even as a guest of the hotel and at the food court a beer will cost you $15 and a slice of pizza $9.    The costs were so excessive they actually took away from the enjoyment of the weekend. And the air conditioners need to be updated the room air conditioner could not keep up with the heat.
50,The Luxor is everything we want out of a casino. Place is kept clean. Easy access to other casinos. Options for food is okay. Rooms are excellent. Hostess is accessible. VIP room meets our needs. Easy ckeck in and out
10,Made reservations for 3 rooms called them twice to let them know I was checking in late. After waiting in line for over 2 1/2 hrs TO CHECK-IN I was informed that there was no room available…My room was given to someone else other guests also were told the same… meanwhile my friends got the other 2 rooms. It is now 3:50 am. My wife is sleeping in a booth in their food court…  What a deplorable service and start of our weekend getaway.  So disappointed with LUXOR..
50,Exceptional experience. The room was phenomenal and clean. The price was so economical. The staff and the service they provide was second to none. The vibe and the atmosphere was just great. I can not find the perfect adjective to describe the environment. It was just amazing.
30,the hotel is still a nice hotel but for the money you can do better.  the place is outdated the elevators dont work half the time. it looks durty in places and it looks like they dont have enoug workers .
40,Nice hotel and casino. Check in/out needs some work signage for parking during events needs a lot of work and only sided elevators creates very far room locations. I will not be coming back unless I have to due to location
50,I was allowed to check in prior to arriving which was very convenient due to my flight being delayed an hour. Upon arrival I did not have to wait in line I was able to go up to my room to get settled. The housekeeping kept my room clean but made sure to keep my items where I placed them. When I passed any employee in the hall they were always pleasant and professional.
10,I had to stay here for a conference and it was awful I can’t recommend enough that you go elsewhere. They don’t have enough staff dirty rooms terrible service.  Clearly they aren’t paying people enough because they can’t get anyone to work there. I only saw staff when I went out of my way to track someone down when I had a problem (numerous times).
10,Terrible experience. No water no housekeeping no room service no way to have food delivered no fridge no microwave no coffee maker broken elevator broken escalator broken tv remote dirty unhelpful staff.
30,Waiting in line was too long as i wasn't able to use my car parking code  and too much detours at night. The ashtrays werent available on every machine. Some machines were dirty with coke and bags. No clear signs to every elevator to the floors
40,The stay was quite enjoyable. We enjoyed the shows and the meals that we went to a show AGT and ate at Diablos. Most of our stay was inside the hotel property. We would like to experience more at other MGM properties in the future.
40,I stayed at the Luxor this week in conjunction with attending a conference at Mandalay. This was the overflow hotel. I was in a tower toom near the spa and pool entrance which was pretty convenient. The pool was nice and clean although the one with the slide was closed and the pool bar had quite the variety of drinks. Boo on not letting ppl know a pool is closed. The room was nice with both a soaking tub as well as a super hot shower (a must have for me). The only thing missing is a minbar. The property has 3 starbucks and a host of other eateries so food was easy to find and apparently you can get some to deliver in the morning. It was also super quiet so I slept like a log. I don't know that I'd pick staying here again as it's well off the beaten strip-path but it was very good for its purpose.
20,This property is outdated poorly cleaned and all processes took wayyyy too long. My room was not clean from the bathroom to the bed and desk abs the water went out for many hours while I was staying and the only apology was two mini bottles of water
20,Service was unhelpful and rude. I waited 45mins for a bell hop. I had so many things there was no way I could carry them myself. They kept saying they were sending someone instead of being honest about being busy. They never did anything to say sorry about this experience. Room was nice and clean.
40,My primary negative about the room is no refrigerator or coffee maker. Lots of Starbucks all over the property but I just wanted hot water to make oatmeal.    The app makes check-in and check out super easy!! One improvement on that would be to have a key printing station near the elevators for when technology is not working.
30,The Luxor was an ok hotel to stay in but there wasn't much to do there and especially nothing to do for my teenage kids who attended our wedding. The rooms were nothing special and no one had a good view out of all the groups of people we had scattered throughout the different buildings. The garbage could be seen on the rooftop what a view. The elevator kept getting stuck with my mom and kids inside. The trash can in the room was so tiny I had to bag my trash. The rooms outside of the suite have no refrigerators so my kids and wedding guests had hot drinks in their room.
30,Gave me a hard time redeeming comps.the room was average no refrigerator or microwave was a real problem for me. Our bathroom had slow drains and toilet didn't flush very well. Underwhelming for the money
10,Water was turned off from 1-3pm Called front desk to report but no one answered. I called the front desk 2-3 times my wife and mother in law called as well. No one pick up. This should be resolve by MGM management so other people would not experience what My family and I experienced.
50,Staying at the Luxor was great! From check in to check out it was done with exceptional service. Gambling was great especially when the manager Victoria Smith makes you feel like family! Definitely will go back.
10,We were given a handicap room I am not handicap and there was no one who would help us try and find a new room every response I got was we are full this was a rewards comp room so I think I will not use my rewards at MGM properties anymore
20,Very hard getting front desk. Had to go downstairs twice. No microwaves in rooms. Ac didn't work in my room. Was told different price regarding late checkouts. After waiting to get someone on the phone have to debate with Csr about bill.
30,everything was fine rooms need updating we flew in for the stadium tour so it was ultra convenient to the stadium. was nice to see all the fellow rock and rollers who thought like us. great visiting with them
40,My overall experience was good. I was a little disappointed in the room quality. The mattresses in my room were terrible. Also in the bathroom along the bottom of the shower door was mold and calcium scaling on the corner of the shower was black mold. The ice bucket was terribly small. The rooms did not keep the outside sound out for example I was awoken at 6am to vacuuming outside of my room door. There are also no fridges in the standard rooms. Which I thought was a common thing now.    The customer service was FANTASTIC I was very happy with that part of the trip all the staff at the luxor were great and seemed to enjoy their jobs.
50,Had a GREAT time at the Blackjack table and Lambo was the BEST HOST EVER! He made the game really fun and taught me some things I didn't know. Thanks Lambo! The slots were also great fun and I was thrilled they had JACKPOT PARTY!
50,Cool building. Place is incredible. An amazing build. Truly a great piece of Vegas history. Beds are awesome very comfortable. A/c works perfect. Very clean awesome food at deli. Will definitely go back.. thank you all
40,Will highly recommend someone to stay at the Luxor for the their first trip to Vegas. Great casino and stay you can stay at the Luxor for a whole day or two without leaving as it has shopping dining drinking live DJ on certain nights and of course gambling.
50,I love the Luxor because it’s shaped like a pyramid. The theme is cool and my favorite slot machine is there. I also like the special elevator. Keep up the good work. Bullet club for life. Too sweet!!
40,Everything was fine except the fire alarm went off at 2:00 in the morning for about 5 minutes . Getting startled in the middle of the night was no fun !!!! Didn’t like the fact that the pool was only open until 6:00 pm !
50,The room was comfortable. The staff was very helpful and gave me all the information I needed. I went with a friend and we spent most of our time playing at the Luxor. Will definitely return as soon as possible. Buffet was also excellent.
50,The rooms are very classy and nice. The beds are decent. The staff are very polite and patient. Parking was easy to get to her and inexpensive. The parking garage was also clean and security was present. Although we didn’t get to explore everything we will be back to stay at that hotel.
30,Not the best stay I've ever had. The room was not the cleanest there were stains on the walls and door. The elevator broke twice and I was stuck inside of it with other guests for 20 minutes. The few staff I spoke to were not very happy or friendly. The mgm rewards program rewards are not being added to my account for certain transactions.
50,Overall experience was amazing everything was walking distance and had a lot of great restaurants to eat at and many places for tourism. Hotel prices were reasonable considering the location and it had a very clean and welcoming environment along with spacious rooms. Staff is friendly and amenities are also really good with an amazing outdoor pool. Will be coming back on my next visit!
40,I love the location of the Luxor excellent for events at Allegiant Stadium. The room was clean and roomy. Lots of great food and drinks within the Luxor. I like forward to staying here again when coming back to Vegas.
50,Comfortable room great staff connected to the Excalibur several food items to choose easy navigation to follow throughout the hotel. Early check-in and late check-out available. Food court available.
40,The entire stay was pretty good… I would love to see this entire casino be made smoke free… it is frustrating to come home and have smoke-smelling clothes…    Otherwise…the buffet was quite good… great selections… The hot chocolate was whipped to perfection…
20,Rooms are outdated. Long walks to room. And unless you are above the 6th floor your view will suck. and the electronic key is terrible. Get a room key. And skip the food there. The food has a lot to be desired.
50,The hotel was excellent everyone was great and very helpful. Restaurant Tender Steakhouse was delicious. Hostess for hotel was great. Would stay the again. Price was comparable to the there hotels. MGM knows how to do it right.
30,Construction in the street  Construction in the room next door  Construction in across from the room  Parking being shared with the football stadium for two nights of concerts and then a football game.  What about the paying hotel guest why are we being put out?
20,Hotel is very dated and smelled like cigarette smoke in all areas. Staff looked tired and overworked. Drains in bathroom would not drain and had to call twice for repairs. There are better places to stay and do not recommend this hotel. Please tear it down and build a new one. Lots of character but lackluster accomodations and staff.
30,Watch out for the show tickets sellers. They double charged my card and still haven’t given me a refund  They also take out $50 a day for a deposit and only want to refund less than half. Haven’t been able to reach anyone to discuss all these issues
30,For overall value it'll do. There are some things that need correcting and perhaps they are like many suffering from a staffing shortage. We've stayed there many times in the past pre-pandemic. The post pandemic condition of the hotel is lacking. The elevators look beat up the key card/use your phone as a key is frustrating in the elevators as some of the readers don't work at all and some are a little testy. You can see cracked tile on the floors in many places detracting from the resort experience but the floors are clean. We found the bed a little too hard and the room was really dark even with all the lights on. The toilet was not solidly bolted to the floor and I got tired of waiting on the front desk to answer to report it. They need an all night cafe on property but there are a lot of resorts that can say that. We stayed because of the proximity to Allegiant Stadium for a concert and the price was attractive enough. Like many resorts there the marijuana odor is pretty strong in the hallways but they are at least making an effort to curb it with signage etc. Our room did not come with a fridge.
20,Too tired to move a 3rd time. Disgusting to stand in dirty water to shower. Both rooms same problem. 26th floor. Elevators slow confusing hotel. But the damn shower was so dirty. could you imagine standing in your own funk while trying to clean yourself!
10,Rude staff disgusting rooms and corridors terrible food shower water and sink water had a funny smell. The television barley worked what did of it was static and fuzz. Honestly the list goes on. I love MGM properties for the most part but this one really let me down.
20,The whole hotel needs an upgrade. Rooms are old. Chairs in room are old. No fridge (unless you rent one). Needed fridge especially for insulin meds. Hallways is old and creepy. Resort fee is unnecessary but is automatically added to bill.
50,Love the luxor family .. have been coming every time to this hotel great service and hospitality easy to check in and out with no problem no big lines  good food and great dj at night to spend some good time at the bar or casino. Have a blast.
30,I was overcharged and I didnt get my deposit back!! everything about the place is great except I guess billing... Im not sure what the deposit is really for cause I didnt have a fridge with a minibar and my credit card is already on file..
40,I enjoy staying at the Luxor. Overall cool theme architecture and environment. I love the ability to check in and out on your phone your key is on the app. It is so easy!  This was my 3rd time stating there and I do tend to find new things each time I go. I will say I would rather stay in the pyramid just because it’s so fun! But I’ve stayed in the towers the past two visits and I must say the rooms do not disappoint. I love the side by side shower and bathtub. Plenty of space even has a cute seating area. There could always be more USB ports but they did have a few. The casino was fun. Went up and down in the slots for a few hours. Didn’t win but had fun. Downsides;  Not a lot of food open late bloody Mary’s in casino were not good and no smoking rooms.  There is pizza (which was super good) as well as I think a burger place open until 3am? Downside it’s super far away from the towers. Some other casinos I’ve stayed at had vending machines for different types of food closer to some rooms so I do appreciate that convenience. And I’m a smoker so that’s a bummer on all MGM properties that I have stayed at so far.
40,Got an offer to participate in the Luxor slot tournament. Given 2 free complimentary nights. Room was big and bed was huge but no comforter or towels when I arrived. Room got nice and cold and shower was great on water pressure. Over good stay!
20,Would not listen that I was overcharged on my room for Friday all she would do is refer me back to reservation and I told her I already did they said to talk to management here she would not listen lousy service on her part
10,"The worst customer service I have ever experienced. I don't know if the staff didn't care much because my room was ""free"" from the rewards (not really because you have to pay $45 that you didn't know) - I get to my room and go take a shower later  the bathroom is full of other peoples hair. I made a video showing them clearly not from me as I'm a man and my hair is short and you can see in the cameras i never had anyone else with me. Then I try to call the front desk for a room change and have to stay on hold for over 30 minutes (both calling through the hotel phone and also through MY CELLPHONE on the number from Google). I ask for the room change they say theyll do the change and hang up on me. My room was never changed as you can see in your system."
30,Luxor is a cheap casino close to stadium. They had plenty of opportunities to show concern or quality but just felt like cattle being processed. Room had minor issues with tv needing to be reset multiple times per day and toilet seat did not function properly. Shower door did not close all the way.
50,Great property and location on the strip for the family. The pool was a lot of fun for the kids although the vibe is more of a club/party type. Parking was handy and could be used at all the MGM resorts included during the stay which made for driving around from place to place handy.
50,The Luxor is a beautiful hotel. My room in the tower was great! I liked the décor and the bed was very comfortable. I do personally choose to stay in the Tower since its a little bit more updated. The rooms in the pyramid are still nice and cozy but its just my preference.
10,DON'T STAY HERE. Filthy casino broken safe and shower. Alarms going off all night long. Worst part no one cared at all. Bad and NO customer service. AGAIN DON'T STAY HERE. Smells and filthy all around. Had to wait one hr at 10:00 pm at arrival to check in. Slots are dirty and no employees around. I wouldn't work here -- probably that's why they have no employees.
30,Upon entering the Luxor the check-in line was extremely long but it did move quickly. They charge for resort fees and then charge your card upfront $50 per night for incidentals. Ours was a week stay so that was an extra $300 on hold on our credit card! The rooms cleanliness was shakey and no microwave for a bedroom suite! The bed was awesome and comfortable.
40,We had a great time at Luxor this Labor Day week. Even though the property is a little older it is aging well! The only issue we ran across was erratic water spraying the bathtub but didn't report it.
50,I always enjoy my stay at the Luxor. The main reason is that the staff are always very helpful and polite. I think that all of them are exceptional. I think that the staff at the Titanic Exhibit is their shining star. I am very impressed with the amount of knowledge that they are able to present about Titanic and their ability to go into depth about the topic. Thank you again for a great stay
10,Absolutely the worst hotel! We arrived on Friday at 1230 to get manicures in the Natura Spa. The spa was beautiful the ladies that took care of us were amazing. We left feeling relaxed and ready for our 4 day weekend. 2:00pm we got notice that our room was ready. We have the MGM app so we got our digital key and went to our room 16041. The room was extremely hot. We turned on the AC and went out. 2 hours later we came back the room was still hot. we now understood why there was a portable fan in the room. We went to the front desk around 5pm. We were told there were only 2 premier king corner suits left floor 14 and floor 2. We took the room on the 14th floor. Upon opening the door we noticed the bathroom was not clean. There was a kleenex box on the floor no toilet paper the cleaning rag was on the counter top and the AC wouldn't turn on on one side of the room. we walk back down stairs to show the manager and said well let me give you a voucher to get some drinks we will have to put you on floor 2 but we need house keeping to verify it is clean before we send you to it. I told him this is very disappointing I want something done. he said I will take off 170 dollars and give you 100 food credit. the manager left and the regular girl came back and said I will also take off your 4 days of parking 18 dollars a day. so we said ok. we will call you when the room is ready. An hour and half goes by no call. we go back to the front desk to find out if we have a room. they said oh yes here is your key. we wasted over 2.5 hours waiting to get into our room. the room is clean and the AC works. The view well there isn't one. It is a brick wall in both rooms. The shower in the room is extremely small needs a shower curtain or sliding door more than half of the water ends up outside of the shower. Upon check out we don't see the credits on the app so we go speak to the manager and he tells us well we only gave you a 100 food credit and took off your fees for parking. I told them the gentleman on Friday said he was taking off 170 dollars and then the other young lady added she would reimburse our parking fees he said no we only are reimbursing the parking fees and the food credit. Ultimately the stay at the luxor was absolutely terrible. I regret telling my husband I wanted to go their to celebrate. take your money to any other hotel. pictures will be in order from the 16th floor with both ac broken to 14th floor with no ac on one side and dirty bathroom and 2nd floor with brick walll views.
10,We thought we found a good place to stay in the Luxor we did a lot of research. It was a bad choice it’s location is garbage except for raider games and food gambling and service was really weak. Bar tenders were rude casino was boring food was disappointing. We spent most of our trip ubering to places with better food better slots better service. And cleaner facilities.
40,Got a comp for staying at Borgata at AC and $75 food voucher which worked out well. Public House inside the Casino has very good food and the small breakfast counter gets your food quick and is a great deal and good to boot. I would recommend Luxor.
50,1st time to Vegas. Luxor gave us a complimentary upgrade and a fridge for my wife’s T1D supplies. Very accommodating. Loved the hotel and lots do in the vicinity. Found the servers at the Luxor casino came by more frequently to refresh your drink more than some other casinos that we visited.
30,Our stay at the Luxor had a few bumps while checking in there was no internet to do mobile check in and the line was long. After checking in our room was hot and they came immediately to check it. The room was nice beds were comfortable but only 3 pillows per bed. There wasn’t any fine dining but the restaurants that were there were good. The casino was ok it felt small because of how low the ceiling is low. The pool was great it had seating inside the pool the pool bars were fast to serve drinks. The location is not great but it is connected to Excalibur which you can get to the strip. Overall we had a good time here at Luxor!
10,I bought early check-in on the app says 11am. That was false as it’s from 11-2 apparently. I went up to the counter after waiting through the long line to then be told I needed to call by a lady who you could very clearly tell did not want to be there and did not want to help people. I might understand that if I was being rude but I had asked a couple simple questions that were her job to answer and she just had attitude and gave me wrong answers anyway. She told me I needed to call since my mobile room key had not shown up on my phone yet after doing the mobile check in. So I called. I was on hold for 30 minutes which I understand. It was busy. The lady on the phone then said she would call the front desk (whom I had just went up and talked to) and see what they could do. She then told me they just needed to reset my app and it should show up. I had already been on the property for over an hour at this point. When I did my mobile check in a couple weeks ago it asked me for my arrival time and I put 11 am. So I waited for my app to reset. 30 minutes go by. It still wouldn’t show up. I had walked back out to my vehicle because I believed I would be able to bring my luggage inside and straight to my room. Nope. So I called again. A gentleman picked up and told me he didn’t know anything about mobile check in and that I just needed to go back inside wait in the long line again and just have them check me in in person. What’s the point of mobile check in to save time then! So I went back inside waiting in the long line again to just check in in person. Whole thing was so stupid and I ended up finally checking in right before 2 pm. What a waste of money to buy early check in when normal check in is at 3 pm. Basically I had a better experience at the Travelodge down the strip then I did at this “fancy nicer” hotel.
30,It wasn’t the best. The 4th floor we were on we were by all the equipment and it was gross. It’s like no one cleans it. The hallway had been flooded and nothing was said to us when we checked in at the front desk.
50,This trip was long overdue.we have 3 kids and have not had a vacation in over 6 years. Every staff member we came in to contact with was amazing. Brittney cocktail waitress at pool was awsome.Thank you luxor for the funnest weekend we have had in years.
20,The mobile check in is the only convenience this hotel has to offer. There are not shuttle services and this hotel is not in a convenient location. There are not many restaurants to choose from. There is a sewage smell by the pool. They have two pools but only opened one. There are no mini bars or refrigerators in room. There is also no coffee maker in room. It cost more to stay in the stay well suites but it’s not worth it the room was no different than a regular room. Definitely not a suite.
20,Stayed in the main pyramid on the 28th floor. It reminded me of a horror movie where guests would find the hidden 13th floor.    Poor lighting of broken fixtures and broken decor made it feel like you were in a back alley of a motel six.    The whole experience and how basic and unfinished the room was gave a very depressing feel.
30,Room felt damp with no fridge or coffee maker. Bathroom smelled off. I would come back for work but wouldn't bring family. Casino had close access to the tram ride which connected to other hotels on the strip.
10,Unacceptable dark dirty and uncomfortable. Every aspect of this property is outdated. Service is noon existent you cannot get anyone to answer the front desk phone. Bathrooms leak water beds uncomfortable and worn out. Pool is unsanitary and the water is cloudy and overcrowded. Other pools were shut down. This used to be a work of art now it's a remnant. I cannot believe MGM had not done what it needs to do and being a MGM member and patron for over 20yrs I was so disappointed we tried it for a change vs our norm of Vdara Aria and Signature.
40,Took in a show at Allegiant. Extremely convenient for that. The room was great. Upgraded to a tower room. Was like $5 more. Only bad thing is if you are in the room during the day the bass from the pool can be heard. If you aren't there during the day not a problem.
10,Where to start but the Stay Well rooms should actually means something and they don’t! Hahaha just a gimmick was really looking forward to the Aroma Therapy showers for night time relaxation didn’t work. Room was filthy with articles and other peoples keys cards etc left in drawers just felt gross!
30,App didn't work upon arrival negating my early check in. Room HVAC kept turning on by itself after I turned it off... repeatedly. Refrigerator was removed from room which we could have one if we wanted to pay extra for it (wtf?). No in room coffee maker. Just seemed to be nickel and dimed for basic amenities.
40,Stayed at the luxor we had a great time. Nice casino good restaurants. Pool was great. We stayed in the pyramid and yes there was a lot of walking to get to the rooms but overall a great trip. Would definitely book back here again next time we visit.
50,The Luxor stay was a bucket list item for me. I love all things Egyptian. Everything was just wonderful. The decorations the navigation the staff the restaurants. I love that I could go to either of the two properties beside us without going out in the heat. The room was clean and quiet. The bed was so comfortable. We were near elevator and didn’t hear anything all night. I’d most definitely stay here again and recommend to anyone.
30,We stayed here in July. The Luxor was fine but not exceptional.  We knew it was a big hotel but it really was huge and busy. Long walk to the lifts to get to the tower rooms. The room was a good size and clean.  It was a bit of a hassle as we needed to rely on wifi which didn’t always work near lifts and in parking area so the digital key didn’t work for us and we had to get a key card at reception.  If you are travelling with family under 21 you are not allowed to sit in the hotel bar areas. (Might be the same in other hotels but it was our first trip to Vegas). You can walk through the casino and kind of have to to get to the car park.
30,Good for the most part it wasn’t exceptionally clean but it was manageable. The keys in the elevator were annoying. The staff was friendly and helpful. Mostly everything was good but could have been better.
30,Too expensive and I don’t think was worth it because the room was dirty and everywhere in the hotel was just smelling like cigarettes. Also the hotel is kind of old I’m not sure if is because the pandemic but it used to be better.
30,We reserved ajoining rooms and the connecting door didn't work and in one of the rooms the bathroom had a water leak causing a fall and trip to the Hospital. Security was unable to bring up a wheelchair and I had to find one on my own. Management did not even show any concernand never got us our a joining rooms. The rooms are dated and don't have a mini bar or refrigerator and the walk from the elevator is very long making it difficult to get refreshments.
30,I wasn't expecting much from Luxor I already knew the place needed a major renovation but it seems like management doesn't the walk way to Excalibur is still broken after 4 years the AC is out. The restaurants were few and sparse the lobby was still just as lonely as it was the last time I visted.
40,Rooms were old and far from the entrance and elevators. Casino and entertainment section is good. Staff is friendly. Need to work out on the quick check ins and check outs. Overall good option in Vegas.
50,I would 100% recommend staying here. I had stayed here about 10 years ago so I was hoping it was still a good resort considering so many newer options and it was! I’ve stayed at other resorts in Vegas on other areas of the strip and have paid much more for a room. In my opinion this place was such a steal!! It was always easy to get food there is such a variety you can easily go to other resorts within a few minute walk. I had a tower room and it was very spacious and clean. The bathroom was nice. Housekeeping surprisingly came on the 2nd day of or stay (3 days/2 nights only) I had seen reviews saying this hotel was dirty/run down. I really didn’t see or get that vibe. If anything it felt more clean than some of the hotels in the middle of the strip less “riff raft” as well. I will definitely stay again. Also used the MGM app. Contactless checkin/out never had to interact w front desk. Digital key.
10,My room smelled badly of smoke. The shower has half glass and the the rest of it is wide open so when your taking a shower the bathroom floor gets all wet. I can tell that the bathroom gets soaked often because the back bottom of the bathroom door is all rotted and bubbled out from moisture over time. The air-conditioning in the room was a joke it read 65 degrees on the thermostat and it was always warm in the room.  On the first night of my stay around midnight a really LOUD alarm siren was going off in the hallway for quite a while.  I tryed multiple times to call the front desk only to be on hold for more than 15 minutes at a time and never speaking with anyone because someone would pick up the phone and hang up. I went down to speak to someone physically at the front desk and the lines were atrocious. Finally I just gave up and decided to just deal with the crap room and crap service and vouched to just never stay at this MGM property. As an MLife credit card holder and Peral member I'm VERY disappointed 😞 in this property. I was so excited to finally stay at the Luxor and it's sad because I had better expectations.
50,Comfortable  convienant the best way to describe the luxor  One of our go to spots for hotels near allegiant stadium for games or concerts  Only negative skip buffet ! Disgusting for sure not worth the price
30,I’ve stayed here in the past but it’s starting to become like Circus Circus. The floors and pool are so dirty the elevators have graffiti. And the security woman was just cold. This hotel is going downhill fast. Excalibur looks better..
10,"no service dirty room needs a lot of work. tried to call for assistance and no answer after waiting on hold multiple times. unfriendly staff. this should be your last choice. At least the prices are great but then they get you with the BS ""resort fee""....should be a law against it....."
30,Not at all what I Expected for the money I paid. I never gotten the $200 in free play nor did I get the show tickets or the food vouchers that I was promised. I won’t stay again. I had to do you want of those timeshare seminars just to get some of the stuff I was promised when I bought my package for $500 they got these people all over the casino everywhere you go you ask for help and all they wanna do is get you to do timeshares I didn’t like it it made me hesitant to even ask for help
20,Hadn’t been to Vegas in 18 years and my wife and I was looking forward to staying at the Luxor again. Alls I can say is dated. The rooms the pools were old and falling apart. All the water features turned off
50,In VAGAS terms shes getting to be  “Older” but I love it!...and you can’t beat the cost!! Love this place  Wish I could travel here more for sure Luxor would be my main destination to stay great way to have an affordable vacation
50,Absolutely amazing property and awesome services property was just awesome and good looking rooms are so preety with good clean lines it was a beautiful stay service is really amazing food quality is just lovely and tasty very warm welcoming staff doing the best job and provides the best service will be come back again definitely for visit and recommend to other friends and relatives to stay in this property thanks alot for best hospitality
10,So many better options than any of the MGM properties. Luxor isn't the bottom but it is Excalibur adjacent. The Luxor is the worst MGM rewards desk so in that regard they are #1. Location is horrible.
10,No refrigerator you have to rent one!  Room was to hot even with ac unit at 65.  No door for the shower had to put towels on the floor  Lines were too long to check in.  It wasn’t worth the price. Cheaper hotels have better rooms.
50,WE had to use up some travel vouchers from SW airlines from a previous trip gone bad. So we used the Luxor for our base while we went to 3 shows and Zion National Park for the day. Las Vegas was experiencing a heat wave while we were there. Around 110 edges everyday. We just did our hiking early in the day and went to shows at night and hung out at the pools.
30,The hotel is dated but the rooms are clean. The keys don't always work and staff is not readily available to help. However when you find them they are helpful. You also want to pay close attention to your bill at the end of the stay we were overcharged almost 300. But it is affordable and the pool was nice.
50,He was very nice to stay at this hotel because his historic in has an amazing looks I had a really great deal through a second party and in for the majority of the amendments everything was fine the shower cloth a little bit nothing crazy to be worry about staff was just OK but also I cannot complain because most things I was able to do in my phone I will definitely stay again and this property
50,Took a weekend getaway to relax gamble and recharge. We stayed in the Stay Well Room that was worth the upgrade. We had dinner at Diablos Great Food and Great Service! Room was clean updated and cozy. Casino floor was exciting with great service. This is Just What I Needed.
10,The hotel was beyond dated wall paper was falling off the wall Missing room numbers were written on the wall with sharpie the walls looked like they hadn't been cleaned or dusted in years. Not to mention our room temperature didn't drop below 79° in either of the rooms we had. When we called the front desk to address our heat issues we waited on hold for over an hour before giving up and walking down. We paid for late checkout on our last day and house cleaning came to our room 3 times even though we had told them each time we had late checkout. The large pool was closed and the pool area smelled like sewage. I have stayed at a handful of hotels on the strip and was excited to stay at the famous luxor. Unfortunately it was extremely disappointing and by far the worst vegas stay I have ever had. Hoping MGMs other hotels are better taken care of other wise this might be our last MGM stay as well.
20,No coffee no refrigerator no microwave hotel control the A/C unit at night no matter how far you turn it down. Horrible odor in the shower when I first walked in. The door do not feel secure so I propped a chair in front of it.
40,Great casino nice restaurants pool area is beautiful . The bathroom floor gets wet and slippery. We bring a bath mat to use in the shower.we really enjoy staying there . Beds are very comfortable and close to other casinos without a lot of walking
20,Door latch had an issue that kept the door from fully closing/locking. That led to us getting our stuff stolen on the very first evening as soon as we left for dinner - I assume someone knew about the issue before we did. You need a partner to close the bathroom door in the room (it closes from the outside but not the inside). The shower drain was clogged so you get an ankle bath with the runoff water. The room was clean though.
20,The gym has a nice selection of workout machines and an expansive range in weights. If you're looking for a place with nice clean rooms and working outlets or USB ports this probably shouldn't be your choice.
50,Go to the luxor it's a wonderful place you'll enjoy I promise it's so many things to do and see you don't even have to leave the hotel you have the titanic exhibit bodies America got tslen carrot top all kinds 😀 of things to do
40,We were there over holiday weekend and didn’t find much entertainment. We did visit other MGM properties while there .  We had massages that were only massage in name.Basically rubbed with oil couldn’t wait to get out of there.we water both dissatisfied with massages very expensive for what we got.
20,Hotel room not cleaned well and mold on wall. MGM Rewards desk clerk rude after waiting in line. Not alot of dining options available. Stay away from buffet not as good as prior to Covid. During stay encountered alot of help that just did not seem to care. Pool area had only one pool availableto guest and it was 108+ the 4days we stayed. AGT was highlight of visit. Been staying at Luxor every year since getting married in 2018 in Vegas.
10,Got to the hotel lobby around 9:15pm took over two hours to stand on the check in line to get checked in. Only about 3 people working the front desk. Finally got my room to find out it was not cleaned by housekeeping. The women at the front desk gave me a room that was not released. Took over an hour after that to get a new room. After 4 days of driving this was not a great way to start my first time vacation to Vegas. The staff could have been a lot more friendlier. The whole resort could have been a lot more cleaner. I get it was an older resort but elevator floors were dirty and sticky including the buttons in it. So many carpet stains and disgusting smells. Sheets and towels in the room had yellow and grey stains. Had a no smoking room but it smelt like cigarette smell the entire stay. For anyone having a future stay at this resort I really wish you have a better experience then I did!
40,The Luxor is my choice Hotel & Casino for its valued shows/activities guest services and accommodations it provides for its guests. Its location on the Las Vegas BLVD provides access to various local hotel & Casino's and proximity to highway access for those who rent a vehicle. I look forward to many stays at the Luxor and playing the tables at my preferred Casino the Luxor.
30,AC was broken when we checked in. It was fixed the next day. Front desk check in took about 45 minutes due to lack of staff. Some of the pools were roped off and my open to hotel guests. The pools closed as 530 on the weekday despite the sign saying 6pm...both of which are WAY to early for a pool to close in Vegas. Rooms were clean. Staff was great when you can find one.
30,Illegal resort fees dirty shower bug bites while sleeping and loud and noisy neighbors.The hotel itself was very nice and comfortable but front desk staff walked away when I would come to talk to them the food so overpriced for the quality of food you get and people staying next to us were loud all day and night.
30,I paid for 9/6-9/8 and arrived at 12:30am on 9/7. The room was not cleaned from the previous guests. Guest serviced switched my room but I couldn’t get to my floor in the elevator. I was distraught and security ended up having to escort me to my room. Security tried using my mobile key and it didn’t work so they used their key instead. I didn’t end up getting a room until 2am and had an interview that day at 7am so I didn’t get much sleep that night. Overall check in experience was horrible but the rest of my stay was fine once I had a physical room key.
50,The building itself is beautiful inside and out and the rooms were on point. Def did not disappoint! Didn’t get to go to the pool due to other plans but it was a beauty too! I will def stay here again when I come back. Wish there was complementary wine for the birthday girl (me) !!!
40,Staff seemed extremely nice and friendly. The retail stores were pushy and one of the people called me a whore not thinking I heard him because I didn't want to get eye cream. Management was apologetic and addressed the issue.
10,We stayed at the Luxor Hotel for several days (09/02 -09/06) and our vacation got ruined by an experience which I hope to never experience ever again.    On the 5th we paid for a late check-out until 3pm. On the day of our check out we got to our room (18101) at 2:45pm and both of our card keys were no longer working. We saw two cleaning ladies cleaning up our neighbor's rooms and we asked them if it would be possible for them to open the door for us. They informed us unfortunately they cannot open rooms for guests however they offered to call security for us to see if they can unlock our room. We waited about 10 minutes and no one showed up so I reached out again to the cleaning ladies and she was calling security once again however the person at the other line would just hang up and not respond to the clearing lady calls. I could sense there was some tension and frustration with the clearing ladies and the security office.    I asked my husband to go down and get new card keys for our room since we had a flight to catch. However he had to wait in line at front desk and by the time he got the new card keys and up to our room it was 3:05pm. The new card keys he got did not work since it was past 3pm. Now both of us are getting flustered with the situation so I ask once more for the clearing lady to call security to see if there is anything they can do. The wait at the front desk was quite long so we were trying to not deal with that. The clearing lady is telling me that she is calling security but she can’t get through since every time she calls she gets hung up from the security office.    I ask my husband to go downstairs for a second time now to get new card keys. As I am waiting at the door to our room a security officer comes directly to me and I can sense that he was very bothered by all of this and he was quite upset He ask me very rudely “What's the emergency ?” I explained to him the situation that we are currently locked out and this was the second time we had to go downstairs and get new keys. He then starts yelling at me saying that “This is not an emergency” and “I shouldn't be calling the emergency line for a lock out”. His attitude was very unprofessional and very unnecessary.    We were guests and we did nothing wrong. The cleaning lady offered to call security for us we just assumed this was normal procedure. His demeanor towards us really left a bad taste and honestly a bad experience for us.    As my husband got the new card keys a
20,As a Gold Card member I have earned a $100 food and beverage credit that was supposed to be taken off my bill. I was denied that by the front desk clerk even after showing her a copy of my MGM RESORTS home page. I also informed her (Julie) that I just stayed at the Luxor 7 weeks earlier and requested that she verify that (she could not) she (called somebody after she didnt want to deal with me any furthur) and refered me to the MGM resorts line inside the casino there was no one there at the time except cashiers and a long line of people (i had a plane to catch) Needless to say I did not appreciate the way I was treated by her. I have 2 reservations scheduled for November and december and am strongly considering taking my business elsewhere. Now to add to that experience the 2nd night there the Luxor decided to do some water test at 1 AM which the noise that came out of the pipes was so loud it woke my wife and I from a dead sleep the water was also running from the sink and could not be stopped I called the front desk and was told about this test. Needless to say I did not look too refreshed for my early morning meeting because of this. next up we had a pool view from our suite-Saturday and Sunday we were greeted by extremely loud music coming from the pool from about 8:45 AM all day to 6 PM. (not pleased at all by this if this is supposed to be a vacation to relax beleive it or not most people do not want to hear thump thump lousy music blasting in thier room all day. Lastly my food in my fridge spoiled after 4 days- guess it just did not work that well. I usually have good stays at the Luxor but this simply was terrible. I gave it a 4 only because other staff members were as usual very good to us. I expect these comments to be reviewed and replied to accordingly. Front desk people need better training of thier program especially of people with higher card MGM CARD STATUS..
50,The hotel was quiet for a Vegas hotel very relaxing and clean. Our room was a nice size and very roomy (king room in the pyramid.) We enjoyed the entertainment food games and the staff was very accommodating.
40,Very clean rooms and good price. The tram along with the monorail makes it easy to travel the strip to a multitude of venues and casinos. Our room in the pyramid was very quiet and restful. The gym is very important to me and was excellent with good equipment.
40,It’s a nice hotel with a friendly staff calm atmosphere and good location. It is at the back of the Vegas strip but there is a free tram to take you to Excalibur and that puts you closer to MGM. The food at Diablos was a good portion size for two people. The bell desk has a storage option for late flights so definitely utilize that option! I think my most favorite part is the organization of the hotel. There is a dedicated rideshare (Uber Lyft) entry that is separated from the taxis and self park. There are many many many signs pointing you were to go (even when you order an Uber the app tells you to go to the rideshare entry).
30,Best part sons wedding and reception at the venetian. Our room was so horrible I was sleeping in sweat for 2 nights. Next time I will change hotels and try something different. Lady at front tried to help.
30,The Luxor for me came in as just an average hotel. The couple of things that stood out for me was that the rooms don't come with a refrigerator. If you want one they are available for rent. I thought this was bit absurd. With the casino being in the middle of the hotel the smell of smoke from the casino radiated throughout even into some of my friends rooms. On a positive note the hotel did have good convenient connectivity to some neighboring hotels like Mandalay Bay. Overall the stay was ok but I don't have to stay here again.
30,Nice room with the exception of finding a roach in it. Open concept essentially Rye pleasing love the big tub and separate shower. Friendly staff easy check in and check out. Fun games and shows good food and coffee selections
40,My first visit to Vegas was pretty good I enjoyed myself with my friends I will recommend for people to stay there if they come visit Vegas you are very close to stores that are walking distance that's good
30,The air conditioning in the room was not great. I had read other reviews but ignored them and stayed anyway. THEIR REVIEWS WERE CORRECT. There isn't ceiling vents it's basically a wall unit and it's located towards the back of the room right next to the window.
10,If you want excellent front desk services come here. If you want to sleep well go somewhere else. Pay more somewhere else; this room will make you sweat and want to leave your space as much as possible.
50,We had a beautiful suite overlooking the pool. We reserved poolside lounge chairs. Pool-area experience was incredible! Hotel is very impressive. Loved the food choices too. Also had a great experience with helpful front-desk staff.
20,"Our room was advertised as ""Luxury."" There was nothing luxury about the Premier Suite we stayed in. There wasn't any water in the room no closet the furniture was broken the bath products were subpar the soaking tub looked like it was from 1980 no coffee in room. The staff at the Flight Bar were rude as well as one dealer at the roulette table. We first checked in with mobile app after waiting an hour for our room to be assigned we got in line at the front desk. The woman at the desk was really wonderful and friendly. The place is in need of a paint job wall were dirty and dingy. While the room was old and dingy it was at least clean."
50,Enjoyed my stay at Luxor. Large rooms comfortable beds rooms where kept very clean. This was my first stay at the Luxor my family and I enjoyed it. Will be returning to Luxor on next trips to Vegas in the future.
10,Unfortunately this place is in such disrepair dark dirty and outdated. Beds uncomfortable bathroom shower leaked and no one at the front desk answers the phone to address any issues. The pool is unsanitary and the water is cloudy and grey pretty terrible we could not even enjoy it there was only 1 overloaded pool being used all the other pools were shut to guests.
40,Everything was great loved the room and view was able to walk everywhere I needed to within the strip and get back to my hotel without hassle only thing that could be better with mgm rewards is either more points or more benefits
50,First Time in Las Vegas fast check in eating inside Is a little expensive but good food the place was very beautiful and the rooms big showers with excellent pressure you can get Lost the hotel Is very big.
50,Great staff great rooms. The location on the strip is perfect! Great for beating the heat it is directly connected to two other casinos. Carrot Top one of the best and funniest shows and no I don’t work for the company.
40,It was beautiful inside. Just wish the rooms were cleaner and it came with a microwave or refrigerator for free. It looked like someone robbed the fridge but then you look at the sign saying you have to rent a fridge which I thought was crazy.
50,The entire staff work hard to make our experience an enjoyable experience. From the front desk to room service and housekeeping.  Check in was less than 10 minutes The rooms were very clean and when we needed more towels they were in the room in less than 5 minutes.  Outstanding job by the entire staff. I will be coming back soon.
50,One of the best casinos in Las Vegas we had good service good food everything without living the hotel the pool is awesone. Friendly staff we love that pets are welcome you get to see all this beautiful pets walking around and surprised that even that the hotel is pet friendly its very clean
20,I reserved a 2 bedroom suite/ connected king for 2 friends their spouses and myself for 40th birthday celebrations… my understanding was that was 3 bedrooms 2 bedrooms in the suite and a connected room… but really a 2 bed room is a 1 bedroom suite and the adjoining room. I ended up having to stay at planet Hollywood not anywhere close to my friends during our celebrations. I could have taken a little bit more of the blame for the misunderstanding if I didn’t call 3 times since the booking in January to confirm 3 beds and that we would have rooms connected to each other! Otherwise the service was above satisfactory
30,My room (king) was excellent! However I was denied MGM Rewards points/comps for my birthday/holiday weekend stay. They don't have room service and housekeeping didn't clean my room when I requested. Also the hotel doesn't have a poker room which is the only games I play.
20,"Room was not serviced except for first day. Needed to find cleaning staff and ask for toilet paper tissues shampoo and soap because we ran out. No minifridge or microwave in room. Elevator buttons are falling off and elevator doors do not open fully on every door. No ""Inspection Certification"" in elevator. Dirty hallway floors. Pool closes very early (6pm during a holiday weekend - really?). Mediocre buffet.    With a beautiful main entrance and well-maintained casino floor one can only assume that the hotel guests are being willfully or accidentally but either way erroneously neglected. How such a facility can stand for the aforementioned conditions is puzzling. The casino is cared for very well but the hotel is in disarray. The buffet is nothing to write home about and leaves the consumer feeling like they've not received the bang for their buck. I'm not exactly expecting the Ritz Carlton; I'm more accustomed to the Hilton Hotel variety. But I do know a poorly-maintained hotel when I see one and this place fits the bill to a T."
10,This casino is old and tired and the rooms are representative of that. The water to the tower we were staying in was shut off when we got to our room and remained shut off for 3-4 more hours. The refrigerator barely got cold and had cracks in the back of it. One nightstand was super shaky and felt like it could collapse at any time. Both bed side lamps were shaky and one was hard to turn on as the switch had to be at a half on/half off place.  Our room was so warm that we kept the bathroom door closed at all times. It was like a sauna when we opened the door. The couch and chair were so run down looking that we never sat in them. Mind you this was a one bedroom suite that we were staying in.    The food is awful. We ate at the buffet and it was so bad that they ended up not charging us. We ate at the cafe and the eggs on my eggs benedict were completely hard cooked and served on a burnt English muffin. My husband’s BLT was served with a fried egg on it. The manager said I should have specified how I wanted my eggs cooked…. Eggs benedict is supposed to be with poached eggs!  We also ate at Diablos and it was so dirty. The 2 small tables that were pushed together to make one table were just gross. The crack between them was filled with crusty old food crumbs and the top wasn’t much better. it was so bad that I actually took picture to show someone even though I never did address it with anyone. Luckily our resort credits are good at all MGM properties so we were able to enjoy much better food options than what Luxor had to offer.  We have stayed at the Luxor in the past and know that it is not a higher end resort but this trip made it clear that this will be the last time we stay there. The Luxor and the Excalibur are both in need of some major major updates/remodeling.  We are MGM platinum members and have the option to stay at any of the MGM properties and will definitely choose a different property next time. We have stayed at many of the other MGM properties including Bellagio Aria Mandalay Bay MGM Grand Park MGM NY NY Nomad and even the old Monte Carlo and have never said we would not return to any of those properties. We play enough that we get great comps but will definitely not be using them to stay at the Luxor again.
10,I checked into my first room and the bathroom had water leaking from the ceiling and the water was all over the counter the hairdryer and was smelly and extremely unsafe. After I spent a night in the new room they gave me I woke up and I was covered in bed bug bites.
30,Several years ago we experienced issues at the Luxor. On a recent stay we decided to try the property again. Room was clean fixtures were updated it was quiet (did not hear noise from casino or outside). The temp in the room was a little difficult to regulate but other than that it was nice.
30,Excessive resort fee. Poor ventilation in the bathroom needed more soap keycards get erased very easily casino reeks of cigarette smoke (did not gamble there for that reason) did not receive an itemized bill after using Express checkout still waiting. Door handles were very dirty especially considering we are in a pandemic.
50,Our stay was very nice the housekeeping were so attentive with us. They made sure our room was clean and that we had enough clean towels. We will definitely stay here again. Overall experience was great!
30,I get it everything is directed at the casino but does everything have to be a money grab?    No shade at pool unless you “rent” a spot with an umbrella?  No coffee maker in room so you have to go spend $15 on two coffees  No fridge so you have to go buy drinks.  I get what they are trying to do but there’s a limit…
20,The hotel is of a very poor standard. From the previous era. Everything stinks of moisture. Waiting for the elevators takes a lot of patience. Lots of drunk people inside. customer service at the reception indifferent and emotionless. Without any empathy.
40,the Luxor provided a clean and friendly atmosphere. The only short comings is the distance one has to travel into the hotel from parking and the long walks to the elevators and rooms. The room did lack a small refrigerator otherwise it was very good.
30,"As soon as you arrive its full on stayed 3 nights room OK but the smell of drains coming from the tap - oh god!  Had a halo daybed at the pool that was lovely though service for drinks soon floundered when they got busier.  Casino as you'd expect.  Food nice at Nathan's in the food court recommend that.  The strip is a must see! Try and see the ""Fountains at the Bellagio"" they are amazing!  Would not come back here to the Luxor I'd look at other hotels if we were to return to LV.. (rising costs in the UK suggest that unfortunately we wont be able to)"
20,The staff was great but the room sucked. Air condition didn't cool bed was horrible and sloping which made me sleep diagonally old furniture and uncomfortable. Won't stay there again and personally it is too far down the strip.
40,We stayed in a Tower Elite Suite and found it to be very comfortable. The location of the elevators makes them difficult to find. The property was very clean. We found the selection/variety of slot machines to be quite low.
10,Payed an upgrade fee was the furthest room possible. When I arrived the smell was horrible & found men dirty underwear. I requested to switch rooms. Within 5 mins I had a new room assigned on my app but was told to wait 20 mins to be able to get new room keys. The front desk was not helpful and just instructed me to wait 20 mins over & over. Finally after an hour and a half of waiting I get the new room keys! When I walk in the room definitely smelled better but was hot & humid. Lowered the ac & gave it about 4 hours before I called and let them know two different people came. And both could not do anything to fix it and just claimed they’re “old units” and could only offer a fan. Mind you it was 100+ degrees outside. I complained multiple times and all they could do for me was offer a $75 food voucher. I found a bug crawling in the bathroom which I recorded because I found multiple. I will never stay here again.
40,Good hotel for what you pay. We didn’t have a microwave or mini fridge in our room and the iron didn’t work. Other than that spacious rooms and nice pool although half of it was closed during our stay. Parking is $18/day
30,Pool staff is very rude they closed the pools super early.  Parking is 15 to 18 bucks at day and is not even included on your reservation honestly is not worth it anymore.  We are looking for a better option for our next vegas trip but not the luxor this time.  We've been staying in the luxor for years now but everything is going bad.
30,Over all resort was very nice. But we were upgraded to a suite and wasn’t overly impressed with the room. It was small and a/c was t very cool. Room stayed at about 75-79 degrees. Our room was in the pyramid not the towers.
10,Terrible place we showed up at like 4 am was musled into paying 2x the cost or out on street we got room no ac for 3hrs till some one showed blood in room hairs stainsI have pics still waiting for refund
50,The David Copper Field show was amazing Dinner at the International Smoke was very tasty and service was super. The Crabs table gamblers were fun to be with it was good to place bets at the sports betting area.
50,Nice room stayed in the west tower. No view for us. But room was clean and comfortable. I would stay in the main hotel next time. Great value. Won a bit on the machines. Had a nice breakfast at the hotel.
10,Once my family and I got into the bed room. I notice the door handle for the bathroom was broken and couldn’t be unlocked from inside. So I waited until the next morning to politely go down and get it appointed and fixed. Went out the whole day and came back and it still wasn’t fixed. Not only that no room service came through to make up our beds change our towels out or clean the room.
30,Be aware that the elevator (inclinator) moves sideways and is shakey. Pretty scary! Check your tables for cleanliness. Ours were dirty and with crumbs! The WiFi is bad. My sheets were spotty! The key entrance box went out and I couldnt get in my room! I won't be back there. We paid too much for what we received.
50,Everything was excellent we had a great stay. There’s so much detail on the hotel since it’s construction 1993 the attractions was removed .. however acomodación for new place was excellent hdhdhehehehr
30,The hallways and the walk to the rooms was dark and dirty. The tops of the structures on the interior which the balcony outside of our room looked out onto we’re filled with trash and dust and looked like nobody cared. That it was just allowed to be that way.
30,It was a nice hotel/casino. My biggest issue with it was the location. It’s at one of the ends of the strip which all the stuff is mostly happening in the middle of the strip so you have to do a lot of walking if you want to be in the middle of everything. Also wish they had a club within the casino so we wouldn’t have to go out far for one. Their could have been more food options as well. Overall it’s nice it’s pretty clean the pool area was pretty nice as well.
10,The rooms have horrible ventilation so if you want to smell poop from another guests bathroom everytime you enter your room stay here. Maintenance took a day and a half to come to our room to check on it. Couldnt fix it. Pool was nasty floating vomit in it and hardly anywhere to sit. Music was insanely loud too. Definitelyfor partiers not relaxers. Rooms were disappointing to say the least. They looked like my grandmas storage unit. The beds were insanely hard and uncomfortable. Everything was very dated. Definitely not worth it. Will be staying somewhere else if we go again.
10,This place is not a pleasant place. Beware! We had issue with the AC and we were told there was nothing they could do for us. The Manager was rude and wouldn’t help me with anything. All he could do is get a Technician with no ETA to maybe fix it. Ask for a refund and told me he could “maybe email the “third party” for me. “about all I can do!” Is what he told me. We left the hotel and Expedia was excellent and helped us out! Do your self a favor and find a better place than this one.
50,The hotel has everything I needed. Very clean and I’ll probably stay again. The staff was very helpful and the casino and hotel was easy to navigation. The shops were cool being able to get gifts before I when back home
30,The service here was slow the rooms were just okay and the smell of the front desk and shops were like vomit and standing food consistently. It was a difficult check in process when we got a second room and they wouldn't allow us to get the points because my girlfriend ordered the room so even though I paid for it we got no rewards
40,O er charged other then that perfect I was super happy with the room and the cleanliness was pretty good and I'm super picky being a former housekeeper my standards are high... There were plenty of towels which I was surprised and thankful for.. I had a hot tub and the view was amazing...
40,My boyfriend and I flew in to see Usher. Older property but kept will and clean. Stay there over 10 years and had a positive memory of it so that's why I chose Luxor again. Definitely will go back again!
40,People are quick to complain about this hotel and I’d like to say that I was pleasantly surprised with this hotel. I have stayed at a lot of properties on the strip and if you are looking for a clean reasonably priced place to stay in Vegas I would recommend the Luxor.
30,Pretty average hotel casino nothing too crazy. Pool was pretty cool and the rooms were nice. Just wish they all came with a frig to store water cause with that heat your gonna need it forsure. Buffet was not the best but it wasn’t terrible either.
50,Great experience... Great atmosphere and lots to do. The Luxor is a hotel you must stay at. The food is amazing drinks are good there's just so much to do. This was not the first time I stayed at the Luxor and it sure will not be the last.
10,We stayed at the Luxor for 2 days and 2 nights. We had to move rooms due to the carpet being wet and sour smelling. Staff was not very helpful. Never had our room cleaned by housekeeping. Every time we had to call for something the staff was rude
10,I had a terrible time with security at the pool. 30 minutes into sitting down they came up and accosted me asking if I had too much to drink. I was still waiting for my first drink. I asked for the manager and he came over and offered me shots although all I wanted was an apology from the security guards who were on a power trip. He said that was impossible even though they were were employed by MGM.    I'm a very loyal member to MGM. Usually book Amex FHR. And decided to try the Luxor Temptation Sundays pool party. I had the worst time ever. I highly recommend not to go because of security.
40,The elevators are horrible and takes forever to get where you want to go as there seems to be only 1 way avoiding stairs. And then it MIGHT stop on your floor. But enjoyed my time at the adjoining property. A little out of the way to get everywhere else but uber shrunk the town.
50,Love this hotel!!!! I will stay at this hotel each and every chance I get!!!! It is so close to everything on the strip and well worth the price. The things to do inside the hotel were awesome. Titanic is a must see as well as Bodies
10,Rooms rough shape  ac not working switch rooms with another bad ac will not stay again cleaning staff skipped our room 2 out of the 3 days  down stairs staff was just ok 50/50 on service  comps were not great
20,I really had a bad experience. Room was not ready. A towel with blood was on the new room. Blanket with darks stains on bed. One employee asking if I speak English. Security from front desk rude. Sincerely it was a bad experience. Please pay attention what you guys are doing
50,Absolutely the best hotel for the money in Vegas. Great staff amazing food and within walking distance of some of Vegas’ hot spots. The new tower rooms are a great value without much of a cost increase
10,This has to be the most disappointing stay I’ve ever had in Vegasthe room over looked a wallthe air conditioning is a joke and the staff just couldn’t care less.  A total refurbishment is needed in every department including the show as I saw Fantasy why do so many want to see this load of rubbish bored looking girls that aren’t that attractive at all and it’s all so fake the singer is so click tracked it’s untrue and she can’t remember the peoples names in the audience she has pestered a minute earlier.  Murray Sawchuck must be the most annoying man on the planet with average magic I saw done better 30 years ago.  The worst thing about this show at the Luxor has to be the audience participation I didn’t pay good money just to watch some guy from Cleveland pretending to be Elvisthe specialist act silks and pole dancer was so dull and boring.  Anyway I will never set foot in the Luxor again and if you need assistance on the phone you will be waiting a long time.
50,Just returned from the Luxor. Not sure why there are negative reviews...we had an amazing time! Check in and check out was great! We had a 2 bdrm suite on the 4th floor in the West Tower. Convenient to the pool and to the casino. Always clean and our cleaning lady was fabulous. Restaurants are really really good! Friendly staff. A special hello to Ginger a server on the casino floor. She was so sweet and always greeted us with a smile! Another very special thank you to our host Sue. Luxor is very fortunate to have you! You are amazing! The only unfortunate thing is that we were billed for smoking in the room (we didnt) but our smoke alarm went off during the night and hence we were billed. It was quickly resolved and taken off our bill which was much appreciated!! Pool was great with friendly servers! Yes only 1 was open but big enough to accommodate everyone! If you are looking for a high end stay look elsewhere but for the price this hotel goes above and beyond! We won't hesitate to return!
20,First the parking in the back is quite expensive and we decided valet was equal if not slightly not much more expensive. It was not busy like it use to be. We went to check in and I guess customer service is not priority. A man with no sence of humor or even a smile on his face. Cold stone computer service. We was to be in a pyramid room and we got some crappy back side of the hotel. The building is so in bad shape. Scratches holes and peeled paint/wall paper everywhere. They let it go to heck. Carpets filthy and nothing comfortable at all. Beds had stains and it feels like we were being watched. The air conditioner blew hot air. The toilet was broken. Such a disappointment. You make some one aware of this and we got oh ok we will send someone up. We was told they do not change bedding between guest. Just every four days. Wait what gross. They are just nasty.
50,We had a great time at the pool party on Sunday. Great mix of locals and out of towners. Everyone was friendly and having a great time. Will defiantly be going more often next year. Luxor is close to the allegiant stadium.
20,Showers on the 24th floor have almost no pressure no one cared to explain where the food and beverage credits worked and when you go to ask you have to wait at the front desk for 30 minutes because they only have 2 people working it. You want to use the credit for a pickup order? The app doesn't let you you have to go to an obscure website that brings you to the ordering portal.
50,I enjoyed my visit at the Luxor fior my birthday celebration continuance. I was extremely impressed with the staff at the front desk when I checked in and when I checked out. I appreciated the manner in which they handled any pronlem that I had during my stay
10,Pay almost $200 for a room down a back dingy hallway. No fridge no AC shower backed up very quickly issues with getting my car from valet. Won't choose that casino again especially for what one is charged for everything. Charge extra to use the self parking charge extra for a fridge charge extra for late checkout.
10,I won’t ever stay there again. It was terrible. Me and my girlfriend wanted a nice vacation away from utah and we thought the Luxor was the move. But it was not good. We wanted a nice and clean room but that is not what we got. The bathroom was disgusting and had hair and dirt everywhere. The front desk wasn’t responding to any calls. The tv had no service for any of the channels and was shutting off as soon as a show played. I will not recommend this place to anyone. I won’t ever come there again. What kind of pool in Las Vegas closes at 6. Ever travelodge pools close at like 10. You guys need to do better.
20,Sticky stuff in the floors of the elevators. Smoking aloud indoors. Smell of marijuana in our room. Keys didn't work all the time. Pool closes at 6pm! Like seriously. One of the pools was roped off you couldn't even use it the one you see in the pictures. A LOT of the escaladers didn't work. Definitely not the best location either. But tower room veiws are nice. Room was alright but the tv volume does not pass 25.
50,Everything was great except that the in-room refrigerator was simply missing from its cabinet. Perhaps it had been removed for service? Or stolen by a previous guest?  Other than that minor anomaly everything else was perfect!
40,All the staff encountered was extremely courteous and anxious to resolve any issues or provide any assistance possible. Unfortunately the constant marijuana smell throughout the hotel tower was extremely off-putting every time heading to/from the room.
40,It was good for the money paid. Not a bad hotel to stay at if you get a great deal. Too far from the strip for me. I would prefer to walk out the hotel and have options. Not walk about two blocks first.
50,This was an extremely comfortable and convenient stay. We would definitely spend time here again. Although we don’t go to Vegas for the casinos the inclusion of restaurants and cafes on the ground floor was perfect as well as the short walk to the tram and self-parking. Housekeeping was especially helpful and kind. 10/10 would definitely recommend.
50,The young man that checked me in gave me early check in upgraded my room w/ a great price & was very kind. The hotel is very clean. Bed was very comfortable & the jacuzzi/soaking tub was a nice upgrade. Very relaxing.
40,The staff was friendly and helpful. My room was clean and spacious. The king bed and bedding were cozy and comfortable. I wish there had been a refrigerator in the room. I loved the large walk-in shower with a rain showerhead. There were plenty of towels provided. During tge day I was always able to find a housekeeper if I needed anything else. On the ground floor there was a convenience market that offered everything I needed. There are a couple of Starbuck's a few restaurants and a small food court with a couple of familiar chains. Please know that the menus in the food court are limited. They do not offer all the choices offered in stand-alone franchises. The Pyramid Cafe was my fave Luxor restaurant. Twice I ordered the Nashville Hot Chicken Sandwich. Delicious! Even the special Cole Slaw and I don't like cole slaw. Checking in and checking out were quick and simple. There are taxis available at the main entrance. At the North Door you can catch Uber or Lyft. The Luxor connects to Excalibur Hotel right near the shopping food court and buffet. I walked over on my last day but wished I had done it earlier in tge week. There were even more good food options in Excalibur. On the other side of the Luxor it connects to Mandalay Bay and the shops over there. I never made it that way. The Luxor was a great choice even though it's located at the end of The Strip.
50,The room was amazing. Clean and so very comfortable. The pillows were top quality. Been travling and staying in hotels for 17 days. This was the best! The bed was the best. Soft where you sink in but firm so you are not hurting from lack of support. Would love to stay again.
40,Very satisfied with my stay. Friendly staff clean rooms multiple dining and gamin options. There are a lot of attractions and things to do that are close by and if not there are a variety of transportation options
10,COMPLETELY DISAPPOINTED WILL NEVER STAY HERE AGAIN  First time in Las Vegas  Luxor ruined my experience. Was embarrassed to even bring any one into my room with how worn and unclean the bathroom in they’re rooms are. Hotel lobby bathrooms absolutely disgusting as well. This hotel only cares about collected your money nothing about cleanliness or you as a guest having a good stay. Cantina restaurant has nasty food - do not waste your money. Chips served were salsa served to me weren’t even good they were stale. Food orders was under cooked- a shredded chicken burrito.. how do u F that up ?? Tower rooms were renovated to allure guest but the update and uncleanliness of rooms will run u away  I purposely stayed up 28hrs nervous to sleep in the dirty room. I stayed in Vegas for 4 days and had only slept a minimum of 3hrs in room due to not being comfortable felt soo damn weird staying in such a dirty place. My stay was $550  only stayed there because it was a pyramid and looked nice Online  which was a set up. Spend your money on cosmopolitan DO NOT WASTE MONEY ON LUXOR. Crackheads outside shooting up with needles on seating areas outside of hotel early mornings.
10,So while on the flight to Las Vegas we received multiple changes to our room- opted to get the room key to our phone- did not work- even after we tried several times- went back to the front desk to get an actual key- finally got into the room and it’s hot muggy and poorly prepped- the only spot you could feel any a/c was directly in front of the vent-then went back downstairs to see if we could get a different room- was told by MANAGEMENT to basically get bent they’re fully booked and maintenance might make it out before we checked out- and that’s the PG version- so no I will never be back nor recommend ANYONE to stay there and will be sure to share our experience on any and every platform I possibly can-the worst customer service I’ve ever experienced
50,We always enjoy our self when we come down all our family that comes with us enjoy them self to.this time that came was my inlaws and my grandkids they had so much fun and want to come again so when we come we stay at the luxor
30,Got a tower premier king & honestly very disappointed. The bed was hard as a rock the digital key would not even work had to make physical copies. The TV absolutely sucked very few channels even available and most of them would not even come in kept freezing up & said channel not available. There was no microwave or mini fridge & I've gotten Much cheaper rooms with those amenities and better bed. The outside looks great and the bathroom was awesome but that was literally the best part. Can't recommend.
10,This hotel is not a good hotel .  They are not liable for anything we got broken into our bedroom and they did not want to be responsible for anything.  It was a horrible vacation we had because of this . We had to deal with all this on our vacation and it was a horrible experience .  Our luggage was stolen  our clotheshoes jewelry money and the entire safe was taken from our room
10,Staff were extremely unfriendly with check in issues everything is very outdated and VERY spread out. Booked a room block with a suite and had a large party join but didn’t get any specialized service. Will never stay here again.
40,Hotel is nice and does the job. The property is a little dated and rooms could use renovations. Room didn’t have coffee maker or mini fridge.  Fair amount of things to do other than the casino in terms of shows and experiences.
30,Front desk staff was friendly and quick. Valet staff was also great. Food service staff needs to improve on customer service. Mattresses need to be replaced. Found old slot machines that I love to play don’t care too much for the new video machines.
10,"This hotel is dark - the halls were dirty - our ""clean"" room had leftover underwear in it - the TV did not work - the carpets were never cleaned - and the same sticky spot in the elevator was there for the duration of our stay. The only shining light at this place was our service at the pool - but it was darkened by the fact that they did not even open ALL the pools!! Hello - it is Friday in August and it is HOT! I was not impressed - especially as an MLife member"
50,When I arrived to Luxor entrance an employee greeted me with a warm welcome gave directions towards front desk then a front desk treated me as a family and last was a housekeeper that gave us a great cleaning service.
20,The services included in the “resort fees” were very limited. As in they offered free boarding pass printing but block all pop ups so you can’t actually print anything…  Free pool access but the pool closes at 6pm every day.  They shut off our water the day of checkout before we checked out.  The best part of this hotel was the taxi line attendants and the bell desk attendants
30,No Comments  One More Casino ( One more of the same)...Made to lose all your money drink service it's to slow! You can try with thousands of dollars in different time late or morning it's the same you never gonna win.
30,"Nothing horrible to say. Is a giant maze with very little help to navigate. Do NOT consider eating here unless you are prepared to spend 30-50 per person for anything g including the ""fastfood"" options. Room was adequate although surprised there was no microwave or fridge in room. Almost clean until you looked at it longer. Would stay again but only on the cheapest of days. And don't plan on using hotel wifi it always goes out as does their app."
50,The hotel was absolutely beautiful the amount of slot games was excellent the Starbucks located inside the hotel was a plus but overall the food options and choices were awesome including the room service dinning for those late night munchies!
40,The staff hospitality of the hotel esp at checkin needs to be reviewed. Nicely built. Good theme. The checkin guyz looked be in a hurry. The hotel is running on these guests. Besides Resort fee the hotel keep 100$ security. I was unable to understand this? Wts the security for??
40,Nicely updated bathrooms and room with strong shower pressure (lovely!). Diablo Restaurant was good value and quality. prompt drink service! Buffet was as expected quality was decent about what you'd expect for the price and staff was friendly. Don't forget to tip generously to support the Nevadians!
30,Rooms were smelling cigarettes. They changed the room and towels were really dirty and hair in it. and the ac was making noise all night. We were on hold talking to the receptionist for over 30 minute.
10,UPDATE  When I stayed there in March 2022 I was travelling on my own and I'm disabled the only thing I need any help with is getting my shoes on during two other trips I did on my own the security team helped me with the shoes each morning.  all of a sudden on this last trip they wouldn't help me refused flat.  I tried to get help from the bell desk and the woman behind the counter looked at me like i had two heads.  i begged for help but they would not budge.  i was made to feel like a pathetic individual for daring to need help.  this experience has tarnished my view of Luxor and cast a shadow over dozens of trips since the place opened in 1993.  I was made to feel less than human and for the first time in many years my disability got the better of me.  I'm a proud military veteran and like to be as independent as is humanly possible but this time I couldn't and the staff at Luxor the managers the bell desk the security team all abandoned me.  I'll never go in there again.  this will always be my memory of the place now and i don't want to chance coming face to face with the people that dehumanized and demeaned me.  I wrote a letter to the hotel management and they did make a half-hearted apology but at no point did they admit that they could have done things better.  I also asked if they could train their staff to better deal with disabled guests but they completely ignored that.  it's a shame they've ruined it for me now.
30,Their was no mini fridge in the room I had to pay $25 to get one. I thought that was out of line. The soda machine on our floor was not cold we paid $3.00 for hot soda/water. Good thing i paid for a mini fridge i guess. Otherwise we had great time we enjoyed Blue Man Group and Carrot Top. The food was exellent although i was informed about the veteran discount alittle late as we were leaving next day. I did inquire at the front desk when we checked in about veteran discounts I was told no.
10,Upon arriving to the Luxor we went to do mobile check in. I had paid for guaranteed early check in which is supposed to be at 11am. It was 1pm and when we finally got it to work it said our room was not ready. And here began a horrendous experience.    After about 45 minutes we finally have to call and we end up getting a room. Upon getting to the room we realized it just was not going to work for us due to medical reasons I will not disclose here. We went back to the lobby and ended up paying for an upgraded room in the pyramid. All seemed to be looking up.    Before I discuss the room I want to discuss the elevator going up the pyramid. It’s horrifying. It feels like it’s going to break and is extremely rickety. This was a major red flag.    When we finally made it to our room the first thing we noticed was the temperature. It had to be at least 80 degrees in there and when we went to try and adjust the temperature on the unit we found out it just did not work. The second thing we noticed was the smell. It smelled like years worth of mold and mildew built up and it was almost gag inducing.    As we looked around the room we noticed stains on the walls and the floors the vent fan in the bathroom was exposed and shooting dust everywhere and the bottom of the toilet was shattered. At this point we had basically decided that we could not stay here.    After less than two minutes in the room a supposed maintenance man begins banging on the door. When we opened the door to see what he needed he said “here’s the remote you ordered”. We had been in the room for minutes and we certainly hadn’t called for a remote. After explaining this to him he attempted to enter the room as he said he wanted to use our phone. We declined and had him leave but this was still very unnerving. A few minutes later another maintenance person begins banging on the door multiple times. It was terrifying. We asked them to leave as we were going to check out and finally they left us alone until we left    All in all it was just a disgusting horrible experience and I would not recommend it to anyone.
10,Have been staying at Luxor many times. Had looked forward to returning but never again.  First night I was bit by something and I had a large dime-sized red spot on my shoulder and some other places.  Receptionist just trying to find other room for the next 3 nights. Disappointed about the handling. No regrets AT ALL from the receptionists side. After our question about what happened now (??)  he removed a nights charge. We asked again and he removed two nights off our bill. We felt like standing on a flea market having to bargain.. Was totally ignored after that and he did not answer - just looked into the screen so we just left. No apology of thanks. Hugely disappointed. Simple lack of respect. We were just a “case to be solved”  That is why this is our absolute last stay at Luxor.  After searching reviews we can see it must be the basic training of front staff.  My husband felt bad being put in a situation to having to ask. We do NOT come to Las Vegas to get free nights and skin problems but to enjoy ourselves.  Now we are having to use cortisol on our bodies - and was compensated with the minimum in the book..
30,Room and service throughout the hotel was great there were no issues in those departments but what brings my rating down was the bathroom in particular the shower. Mold on the handle mildew and gunk throughout the edges. I barely stayed in the room.
50,You have to stay here the most beautiful casino I’ve seen. It has the Egypt theme.  MOST BEAUTIFUL Place I’ve seen in so long. The best part is you are also right in the middle of all the fun spots. Also If you have certain activities planned this is the pick up place which makes it so much more convenient.
40,We always enjoy our stay at the Luxor. The pools are amazing. Casino options are great. Unfortunately the rooms desperately need an update. Wallpaper was falling off the wall in the hallway. Carpet in the room was worn out. Furniture was terribly aged.
40,I stayed in a (West) Tower queen and loved it. It was close to the pool area and clean - I really liked the soaking tub. No complains with the room at all. Check in - and out was simple.  Issues were: of the 3 pools 2 were closed several days making the one left crowded.  I would stay here again though. Not a fan of the resort fee at all but the base price for the Luxor is a great deal. Add the resort fee of @ 35 dollars a day to get the real nightly rate.
50,My 1st time won't be my last time good room huge as. Check in and check out easy. Enjoyable experience. Note for everyone if you are ordering a Uber do so from within the Casino and not the pick-up spot as map gets confused with the casino next door. Also won money 💰
10,Called in at 8pm to have someone come up and change my bed sheets because they were dirty i stepped out and came back around 1:30 room had not been cleaned called house keeping they said they would send someone up this was at 1:35 no one showed up until 2am
10,Room was all dirty human hair everywhere in bathroom dust everywhere. Elevators super dirty as well. Impossible to get in touch with front desk to request change of room had to wait for housekeeping to come and do an emergency cleaning. In general horrible maintenance of premises.
40,Service was great check in was great food court was a little too pricey but food was great hotel stay was great hotel room was cleaned up very well great vibes and great stay I would recommend Luxor to anyone
40,Room was great staff was friendly hadn't stayed at this side of the strip in some time was glad I did. Was just missing some late food options but no problem walked to NYNY and had some late night pizza.
10,During my 3 days stay at the Luxor I had to move room 2X because of non- functioning rooms. The rooms thermostat read 86 degrees and the room with a view faced a block wall. My stay that was supposed to be 3 days felt like 1 day after having to relocate rooms so many times.
50,We had a very positive experience at Luxor this week. The Hotel has really done a good job of upping the appeal factor post pandemic. The whole experience over all was very positive. If I had to leave feedback on an area needing a little improvement it would be The Food Offerings it was kinda hit or miss with the hours and what was offered but over all the stay was above my expectations.
50,Stayed for a 3 night trip with the wife and had a blast! Very clean and cool pyramid! The pools were a hit as well. Only wished they stayed open longer that 110 degree hit will really take it out of ya.
10,Dirty hotel- hair in bathroom mold in caulking stained towels. Steve at the front desk was very confrontational. Long lines for anything you wanted. They acted like they were never busy before…they couldn’t pay me to stay again.
50,The accommodations were a complete surprise. We had a offer for a comped MGM stay and we chose Luxor Las Vegas and upon arrival we were shocked to see a beautiful suite overlooking the city. What a wonderful anniversary surprise!!
40,Room was clean and quiet for sleeping staff were friendly. This time we did not experience any problems. I love the mobile checkin feature and checkout we were able skip all the lines. Our stay was pleasant
50,We had a problem with our room and it was taken care of immediately. The staff is friendly. They went above and beyond to make sure we were happy. Management called to make sure we were happy with our new room and that we were doing good
50,Stay was excellent. Staff was pleasant. Staff was very cooperative. Hotel was clean and beautiful. My girlfriend was impressed with the hotel. She liked it very much especially the fact that the hotel was dog friendly.
20,The hotel is so very hot & uncomfortable. The rooms are even hotter and it feels like the ac is just running in a fan mode and no air conditioning mode. Ironically we had a fan in our room and all lamps were plugged into an outlet strip taped together with electrical tape. The room had old sheets. They didn’t smell clean and clean ne bed had holes in it but housekeeping responded so quickly and came and happily changed our linens.
50,My experience with Luxor this time was significantly better than a year ago. My room was clean comfortable and looked like it might have been recently renovated. The decor was great. Service was great. I liked the extra security with guests having to use their door key to access elevators.
50,Did the mobile check in and check out and was very quick and easy and voided the extremely long lines! Internet can be spotty but other than that it was a great and easy stress free experience! Will definitely stay here again
10,We went to Luxor for our 16th anniversary and upgraded to a suit with a tub next to the window. While my wife was in the tub Spiderman showed up dangling with ropes cleaning the windows. He stopped at our window a kept looking inside for at least one minute. The hotel told us that Spidie could not see inside. Then why was he just staring inside our window?? Also we were told he will be out there till 4:30am every night till mid Sept. Very uncomfortable anniversary to say the least.
10,Within the first hour of the stay in the spa room stay we had the plumber walk in asking to check a leak in which we had our privacy invaded and we were disturbed. This problem should be checked before the stay to make sure everything is in order and works properly. Never again coming there.
10,Felt unwelcome and in a sense unvalued. The manager in the check in desk was not in any way helpful despite having a confirmation for my room she refused to get me checked in at my arrival claiming all rooms were occupied and none where available  a third person on my third attempt was able to check me in kindly .after being asked to go wait for 8 hours before I could get checked in.
50,I’m kind of an Egypt -but so where else would I have stayed. The decor was fabulous!! My room was super clean. All of the staff I intersected with were very nice. Of all the casinos I visited during my trip I liked the Luxor best it just has a good feel. Oh the steakhouse was to die for.
50,Best budget hotel on the strip. First it’s themed very cool. It’s much cleaner than the other hotels in its price range. The rooms can get cold compared to other hotels that stay warm. It’s located around other good hotels.
50,Great room location friendly staff. Only complaint would be a buffet staff member made fun of us to her co workers for not noticing she was trying to get our attention before we entered. Then proceeded to tell us we would tip cash at the table instead of on the machine
20,This place has become so run down it’s sad. The “VIP” check in experience was a complete waste of time. We lugged our luggage all the way downstairs to a completely empty check in area. It didn’t appear that anyone was working down there at first until we heard voices from behind a door. The two ladies looked surprised that anyone was there but they were very nice and attentive. Nothing special about checking in at the VIP area that couldn’t have been done at the main check in. I knew once we got into the elevator that we made a bad choice. The inside looked like a bomb went off and the doors  didn’t close all the way. The room itself was surprisingly nice.  We booked a daybed on our second day. We checked in at around 930 and were quickly greeted by our server who we didn’t see again until 2 hours later. I informed the cabana hosts multiple times that we were getting hungry and thirsty and hadn’t been approached by anyone to take our order for a long time. They apologized but still nothing happened. Two of the three pools were closed so the main pool became uncomfortably full and busy. I get the Raider football pride but soon the pool was full of entire families and everyone wearing Raider gear and throwing a football in an already busy pool. This was the worst pool experience we have ever had. We go down to Vegas 3 to 4 times a year and always book a cabana or day bed. This way by far the worst. I remember when this use to be a fun hotel to stay at. We will not be staying here ever again.
20,The rooms were nice but the bathtubs were clogged and the AC was not working. It took hours before someone went to fix the AC although we are in the middle of summer and no one ever fixed the tub. It made it a very nasty experience when showering
40,Couple things to remote needed batteries that we called and never received but it’s Vegas not in the room much anyway… and the shower the close off wasn’t far enough out so water just kept getting on the floor
50,The location is ideal. Staff is friendly. Room was clean. Decor is par excellence! Would go back in a heartbeat. Overall  Ambience and feel was very comfortable. Food Court shops and shows are all conveniently located. Thank you.
30,"Overall a fine place. Checked in via the app which went well. The""use your phone as a key"" was mostly fine but we kept forgetting to have it ready for the elevator so there was a delay and sometimes the app wouldn't boot up at the elevators. Our first room had a dirty towel on the chair and assorted trash around the room still so we had to get a 2nd one. Boy were on the 4th floor and id recommend a higher floor. Our elevator was hard to get to."
20,Service was sloppy this trip. I ordered and paid for a refrigerator at check-in that was supposed to be delivered immediately (at least while I was out after checking in.). I came back that night tired with food and other items that needed to be refrigerated but it had not been delivered. I had to call (cord kept falling out the handset so I had to use speaker which was difficult to hear) and stay up and wait for delivery later. This was slightly annoying but nothing to post about.    I came back to my room one time to dirty blue latex gloves in the center of my room (I can email picture upon request.) Also a can that was on the end table had been knocked onto the floor and left there. The gloves in particular were disgusting because there was no way knowing how many rooms had been touched with those gloves. I again had to call housekeeping and wait for them to remove the gloves because picking up nasty gloves which had been used to change dirty hotel sheets in likely several hotel rooms was beyond what I was prepared to do. I could barely hear housekeeping (after a very long hold) because the phone cord kept slipping out. Staff seemed pretty non-chalant and indifferent about this; though when I told colleagues and friends about the dirty gloves in the middle of my room they were universally disgusted. I had walked into my room before without the overhead lights on. Stepping on nasty hotel gloves with bare feet is obviously unsanitary and a heath concern. Somebody could easily slip fall and potentially injure him- or herself on a can on the ground knocked over and left there by staff.    I worked hotel front desk for years and remember getting REAMED by guests over housekeeping imperfections a fraction this gross and negligent. Having worked in hospitality I don’t get crazy or rude with people. I wonder if becoming rude is the only way to make staff to care. Luxor staff’s indifference to these issues made me wonder if these sorts of blunders have become commonplace at this property. I’ve stayed several times at this property over the years but this will likely be my last stay here. Luxor now has a lot of quality competition on the strip in its market segment; this experience suggested to me that Luxor no longer values retaining guests. This was very disappointing.
50,I’ve stayed here several times the rooms are clean the price is good I’ve never had a problem here. The beds were comfortable the pools are nice too. The buffet isn’t the greatest but it’s cheap so that’s what you get.
30,The few staff members I interacted with were very kind. But after all of the fees this stay felt overpriced for what I got. The room smelled smoky there’s no fridge in standard rooms and the showers was a handheld wand with no place to set it down. So the whole shower you’re basically holding the same shower wand that someone before you held.
10,"We've stayed at several MGM properties very happily. Try one of the others. This one is not going to get you to return. Aside from the very long line for both check-in (use mobile) or luggage assistance (no alternative there) there are the challenges of the relatively small not high-def television the absence of hot water for a shower at 6:30 am the empty cabinet where the fridge was supposed to be (with a friendly sign encouraging me to use that space for whatever I wished!) the industrial lighting in the bathroom. The bed was comfy! The sideways elevator (""inclinator"") was hard to get used to. Try Delano or Park MGM or Vdara - all are great properties!"
40,People are friendly and helpful. The room was nice and spacious and clean. Only issue the water took a but to heat up and the bed wasn't very firm it sorta sank in thebl middle almost too soft. Overall the service was great and lots of food choices also right on the strip the pricing was great.
10,Room was dirty and didn’t have a mini fridge pool and chairs were dirty and no shade at all should’ve had food and drink credit but never received. Asked and paid for late checkout but never got it until we were woken up by the housekeeping and had to call front desk.
10,"I'm not sure if others have experienced this but it seems like all the staff I interacted with was very rude (check in bell desk and cleaning lady). There was fleas in my room pubic hair on my ""clean"" towels a/c did not work in my room. I did not go down and ask for a different room because I already spent so much time at check in and waiting for my room."
50,We visit Las Vegas once a year and chose to stay at Luxor this time. At had an early flight and asked if it would be possible to check in early we had a room available within 45mins when we were originally estimate over 2 hours. Luxor did not disappoint. We love the room the bed was extremely comfortable the pool was great. Will return again.
20,Stayed in a Suite which has nothing special. AC hardly works. Fee for everything but everything is broken. No desire to ever visit Vegas again. Time share people are a joke and bother you at every entrance to all the properties.
10,I had a bad experience in this hotel. Everything was so far away from the strip. It is an old building and they offered us mgm rewards if we went to a tour at a resort. They held us hostage there for three hours begging us to buy credits with their company they tried to manipulate us say that if we didn’t buy credits with their company we didn’t care about our kids life.
30,on-line room cost was one price when getting there to check-in there was only 2 people servicing the waiting line of people. Then the extra cost for Resort Fee was added which doubled my bill.  I just don't like being told after the fact what the price is. It's like the resort is lying to everyone.  early morning looking for food I found only a Starbucks open. that kind of sucked.
30,Well 200 characters is a lil excessive yet my over all rating would be from 1-10 is a 4. Because my limited personal experiences with staff was non-hospitable. Monday morning during my departure bartender by 2B elevators older lady was very rude. I simply wanted mini bottle waters (4) and the location of a microwave.
50,Always have a great stay at the Luxor. Friendly staff and located near the things I want to do. Also Fantasy is the best show in town. Conveniently located near the new Allegiant stadium and not far from the airport.
10,First set of keys given did not work so I could not go up to the elevator to my room nor did digital key work. As it gets later in the night even though flights are still coming in the check in lines get long and not many employees working. Also once I got checked in the carpet had food and bugs on it dust everywhere (used towels to wipe down) including the a/c vent. Had to call housekeeping to get new sheets and pillowcases because the ones on the bed had black marks and stains on it. Holes on bathroom wall shower head poor quality sprayed all over previous guests hands/markings all over window. Even ice bucket had dust all over it. Overall a very dated place with no refrigerator too. Nice location though to get to other places on the strip.
50,The room was super clean & the shower I wished I’d taken one more cuz the spray from the shower head was just awesome! Would definitely consider staying here again next year just because of the shower.
40,The hotel is very nice but the pyramid rooms could use some renovations as they feel 20-30 years old. I had friends staying in the tower rooms and they seemed a bit newer and higher quality. Bathroom had a tub they had newer TVs and didn’t have any old room problems like mine did. I stayed in a corner suite with a soaking tub. The soaking tub had chipped spots on it and you could tell it’s been in use for many many years. The pool was nice the staff was courteous and there is a ton to do. It’s a decent hotel but I wouldn’t consider it LUXORious. Sorry I had to.
50,Stayed at the hotel because it was close to the concert we were attending.  Casino was awesome! Lyft/Uber location was accessible! We’ve stayed at other hotels and this part is very confusing. So once we saw how easy it was at the Luxor. We had no problem! The Titanic Exhibition inside the hotel was amazing! We had fun overall!
30,Stayed here for 6 nights. On first view the hotel is really impressive both inside and out. Our room was in a tower on the 19th floor and it was clean and smelled fine. Parking isn't cheap but that's the same is same for all Vegas hotels and at least the Luxor is at the end of the strip so getting in and out is easy.    The thing we hated was the constant smell of smoke in the pyramid. If you don't smoke this will really bug and surprise you as it's everywhere. Only Park MGM seems to be smoke-free so this is a common problem.    The other thing I didn't like was the swimming pool. I wanted to relax for a bit on a lounger and moved one to the side to get some shade but was told we can't do this (another Brit couple did the same).
20,"Stayed in East Tower. The room was ok but overall condition of resort was not good. Public restrooms had several fixtures not working they are aware of it as 3 out of 5 fixtures not working had ""out of order"" signs on them even the paper towel dispensers! Carpet was badly worn and downright dirty on walk between Luxor and Excalibur. Also none of the rolling sidewalks were working. As a facilities person it's easy to spot when a company stops spending money on maintenance. The facility is not being maintained above minimum I'd say it's on the way to going out of business."
20,We were here for a wedding. It was a disappointing stay. The bride wasn’t happy either. We will book with a different hotel next time we go. Visually the hotel looks really cool from the outside. It’s located on a good part of the strip
10,Rooms highly run down. Rust and mold in bathroom. Shower would not drain AC did not work well. Staff not enthusiastic at all. Great location and nice pool that's about it. Will probably not stay at this location again.
40,Not sure I visited the same hotel as some of these reviews but I guess each to their own. It’s big it’s not new it’s at the far end of the Strip but most of all it’s fun. Easy check in great room on 12th floor though the sideways elevator was interesting lol. Plenty of choices for eating and drinking.  Casino was well managed and despite being busy at times always had a good vibe. Pools are great plenty of loungers and good bar choices DJ added to the fun at the weekend. We had a great 4 days we did Vegas and staying here gave us a great place to rest and refresh whilst living it up. The staff make this hotel they are happy welcoming and nothing is too much trouble. We will be back.
40,First time staying at Luxor. Location was great. Staff need improvement and buffet was nasty never eating there again. Otherwise it was an ok stay. Floor staff was friendly and welcoming. I would visit again to give a second chance.
30,The location was great since I could walk to Mandalay Bay for Super Zoo very easily staying indoors. The rooms were very dated where I stayed. The bed was comfortable. Be prepared to stand in line during checkin if the QR code check in doesn't work.
50,Been to Vegas a couple of times and always wanted to stay at the Luxor. It looks cool from the outside then when you get inside it smelled amazing. The place is huge and clean and organized. Will be back for sure.
40,Would stay again if at a better price. Need more people on the floor to direct people. The hot water and tub were fantastic. Burger bar was good. I will not be coming back due to homeless and con people
50,We live at work so we try to get away for a night here and there this was a great stay! 10/10 would recommend! Ease of check on through the app and the bathtub were the real stars! The most relaxing weekend we've had in a while!
10,The check in staff was rude the app that they told me to download was faulty and was locked out several times. Ridiculous that I had to try to use the app to just use the elevator. 10/10 DO NOT recommend.
20,Alarm on vending machines went with out service 3 days...unexpectedly annoying this was poor maintained machine..never did work on the 13 th floor..many people did complain about the problem but was always o er looked
20,I’ve stayed at Luxor plenty of time over many years for business trips… it’s cheap and it’s a bed. This time I though I’d “upgrade” to a King suite mostly because the regular rooms don’t have a coffee maker and I’d have to hoop it downstairs to Starbucks every morning.  The suite is nice because of its size… and yes there was a coffee maker. But like every other room at Luxor it’s kinda dirty and very worn… furniture dinged-up and chipped stains on the upholstered bench mis-matched bathroom faucet one of the TV’s didn’t work. everything just shoddy. But hey it’s a comfortable bed and I didn’t come here to spend all my time in a hotel room. It wouldn’t come here again but when the company’s paying for the business trip you get what you get.
50,amazing . I would recommend. I wish as a single woman they offered more of a perks. I enjoyed my room. It was happy to finally say I stayed in the pyramid on the 14th floor. I would liked for room Pyramid Cafe to be opened longer.
50,A great hotel with a wonderful staff and clean and comfortable rooms never had a bad experience here and I've stayed here for the last 10 years plus when I come to Vegas. I always stay in the Pyramid as I like the rooms and views
50,History beautiful Friendly clean above and beyond services great food selection buffets is always good ! Great shows about human body and Johnny rockets . Starbucks at every turn . I’ll always return here !!
40,This was our first trip to vegas. We got a pretty decent deal at the Luxor and liked the fact that it’s connected to Mandalay Bay so if we wanted to hop over to their casino it’s a short walk. Friendly staff clean rooms great price. Can’t go wrong!
40,A good hotel with excellent service near the end of the strip. If you plan to explore the strip plan to walk a LOT or use other modes of transportation to get to key sites on the strip. The property is showing it's age but is still a great experience.
50,We likes the Luxor. Very cool building structure. Never been on an Inclination before. Love the theme and the uniqueness of the property. Nice casino bars cafe etc. The building itself and the structure made things feel special just being there.
40,My friends and I had a awesome time at the Luxor. Cabana by the pool is so worth it. I also liked the ride share set up. It’s a good distance from The Strip if you prefer a break from the chaos. It’s also a great value for the price.
50,This place is amazing has great location excellent room prices and very clean. I would totally come back and recommend it to friends and family. The staff members were incredibly friendly and very helpful at all times
50,Check in staff was very rude. They changed my room from pyramid to tower room without any prior notification. Staff was very rude and didn’t give any explanation why they change d my room. Will not coming back.
50,The hotel has everything you need. Blue Man Group America's Got Talent Titanic and Bodies is right in the hotel. Lots of restaurants and lounges. There is no need to ever leave. The have a strip club as well and a tram that connects you to two other hotels.
50,This is easily one of the best places to stay at. Check in was fast and friendly and the decor inside is very nice. Clean rooms and the pools are big it has about 4 different sections and they were all clean as well
50,If you are like me my vacation is really important for me and my family. I want the best Bang for my buck. The Luxor is the answer. Staff makes you feel special the food is great the atmosphere is exciting the shows are amazing. Everything your want for your vacation experience in one location.
50,Clean and wonderfully located resort with great amenities a fantastic food beverage and show selection and a fun and lively casino. Love that you have access to 2 other resorts from within with 2 more accessible thanks to a quick walk across 2 bridges. MGM Resprts are the best!
50,The value and the location are great. The staff was friendly at every turn from security to the front desk folks. Being close to Mandalay Bay and the Raider Stadium is a big plus. Plenty of Starbucks locations as well!
50,Clean hotel. Affordable price. Staffs are very friendly.    Lots of things to do shows exhibits. Many restaurants onsite. There are walk way and free trams to Mandalay Bay and Excalibur.    Deuce bus stop right outside.
20,Staff was great but rooms were horrible. Mirror was flaking no cups for drinking bathroom had tarnished floors and towels were hard and crunchy. This property is way overdue for a renovation badly..
10,No fridge in room they had a sign in the room saying you can rent a fridge from the front desk haha how horrible is that?  Bad food and over priced at the pyramid Cafe my chicken and nachos were soggy wet from water ...had to tell the waiter to take it back  I was told I would my previous trip i would get a 100 in slot play never happened...
10,Terrible room-and paid for a suite upgrade. Smelly carpet. Wall outlets don’t work. Very poor water pressure especially if you want to wash your hair. Main TV/controller did not work. No one answers the front desk. Takes an hour to get a blanket. Old air system and difficult to regulate. Unlevel floors makes dresser drawers slide and stay out. So disappointed!!!
10,My hotel door battery died on my last night there at 9:40. I went down to the front desk and they didn’t believe me that the battery was dead so they made me try three more room keys. After going back to the lobby again they finally sent security up to check who then called an engineer. It was not until two hours later at 11:45 that somebody finally showed up to help me. The manager told me I had to wait in the hallway so I sat there locked out freezing in just a tank top and shorts for TWO HOURS until almost midnight when the engineer finally showed up. This was the most pathetic disorganized effort. I feel like I would’ve gotten better service in a motel. The only decent person was the security guard Cody who sat with me in the hallway until he was off. Amazed that a big hotel could leave a guest waiting for 120 minutes for help getting back into their room. Engineers finally showed up as I was shivering and crying alone at the end of the hallway. I will absolutely never stay there again and I will warn everybody to avoid it because if something happens god forbid an emergency I’m not confident at the Luxor staff is competent enough to help. Absolutely abhorrent service. Not to mention that when I got there and asked somebody where the elevator was my first time to this pyramid hotel they laughed in my face and told me the rooms were all around me. This was a member of your staff as well. I don’t know what’s going on but the treatment was disgusting and I will never step foot in your hotel again. You were responsible for the worst ending to my first Vegas trip.
30,Overall needs a refresh color scheme and decor dated and depressing. Dark carpet dark walls dark furniture. Sheets clean but low quality same for towels. Bathroom was clean except for shower that had crumbling peeling and dirty caulk seams.
30,Well worn rooms. Stayed in tower. 2 bedroom suite. Old Old Old. Fridge didn’t work. Beds are not luxury. Service was poor. Rented a cabana…also very worn. Only one pool open so it was crowded and quickly became clouded. Water turned off for several hours at resort.
40,I stayed in the Tower. From what I understand this section of the hotel has been updated so it is very nice. All of the workers were very nice and professional and I loved the valet service. Additionally my room was very nice from the decor to the lovely bathroom. I was terrified by previous reviews but glad I saw for myself that this is a very nice hotel.
50,The rooms are clean and spacious. Keyless entry is a bonus. A tiny bit cumbersome on the elevator though. Will stay again. This was second stay already. I appreciate the proximity to the convention I come to attend.
50,We really enjoyed the view of both the pyramid shaped luxor hotel and the beautiful pool area. In the back ground you have the Mandalay bay and Delano that fills up a nice background for photos and videos. Friendly staff and great vibe throughout the hotel.
50,Great location within the strip and close to the airport. We stayed for 3 days and had a great time playing and enjoying the casino amenities.  I highly recommend Luxor Hotel and Casino to anyone going to Las Vegas
10,I was assigned a room that was still occupied! Could have gone badly. Used mobile check in - will not in the future. Always utilize the registration desk to prevent potentially dangerous encounters. OMG!
30,It was not enjoyable. The room was smelly. The fan was always working even if I stopped it. There wasn’t even a single water bottle nor a fridge..the elevators are shaky and I didn’t feel safe riding them . The electronic key card holder was glitchy
30,"After checking in at 3pm we had issues with our room door not working. Which wouldn't have been an issue until I went through 4 key cards. My wife is pregnant so we had to ask our neighbors if we could use their restroom and phone to call guest services. I spoke with 4 different employees and one said they only heard about the situation ""15 minutes ago"" even though a hour and a half had passed of me reaching out multiple times. The hotel team members each assured me each time an engineer was on his way but never came. After finally getting it sorted out we were late for our show because we couldn't get ready for nearly 2 hours my pregnant wife had to ask our neighbors for their restroom and we just kept getting the run around. I would like to give recognition to your engineer  Dean. Didn't get a last name but he was great"
50,Staff was excellent. Room was clean and pleasant. No luck gambling but that is expected. It would be nice to see some people winning when we are walking around but that doesn't happen anymore. Diablos and Starbucks staff were great as well.
30,The hotel is huge so check-in queue was long. The rooms are spacious and clean but are a little dated. We stayed for 5 nights and 2 days out of the 5 our room hadn't been cleaned. Being in Las Vegas everything is 24 hours so everything is on hand but rather than having to queue to purchase a Starbucks coffee every morning a coffee machine would be a nice addition to the room. The hotel offers a happy hour in one of the bars but the staff are extremely slow and after waiting 25 minutes to be served we were told happy hour was finished even though still had 5 minutes left (the bar area wasn't actually busy and there were a few customers waiting to be served whilst the bar staff kept their backs to the bar and took forever to do anything!). The pool area is fun lively and spacious but not sure I would return to this hotel and casino.
30,Very loud A/C in room. This room the bed was on the ground. Very different this time. Internet didnt exist in room.would of been happier with older room in the pyramid. The beds are nicer and a/c is quieter. This was not a pleasant stay luxor this time. Then couldnt even check out with my phone cause internet sucked. Once i dropped keys and got outside i was able to checkout of room on my phone. Just really bad this time.
50,This is a nice resort and casino. The price to stay at this resort is very reasonable. The staff were friendly and helpful. The rooms are clean and the beds are comfortable. I definitely recommend this place.
50,The casino layout is awesome tables are reasonable and the adjacent casinos are fun as well.  Rooms were very nice beds comfy and AC cold. We had a great time at the food court too great selections
50,I loved the Egyptian theme.The location gave easy access to the South Strip properties. Any request was promptly handled by the friendly staff. The Tower room was spacious and clean. Biggest negative is lack of affordable food options.
30,I stayed here for one night because it was a good deal. However the elevators were funky and didn’t work properly. I was going to use stairwell and the stairwell creeped me out so I went back to use elevator. The room was a little outdated.
10,The room was extremely dirty. I called the Front Desk to change the room but they are far from sincere and helpful. They didn't let me change the room. They told that they will have someone come to the room and clean the room soon. However no one showed up. They ignored my last request. They don't think much of guest's voice and request. Customer Service is very terrible. Unacceptable and disappointed.
20,I have stayed at Luxor so many times but this time I was very disappointed. The check in and check out process was horrible. I got double billed and then the elevator key is such a hassle. I tried the app for better check in and it was so bad.
50,The atmosphere definitely seems upgraded since my last visit precovid. The vibe was solid and would most certainly stay again in the future. It’s right by the Allegiant stadium as well!    The light helps find the way if your ever lost on the strip 😆
10,Paid for a Premium room in new tower with Bathtub. Got placed on 2nd floor. Paid for late checkout just to be woken up by staff at 11am. I normally have a great time here but this time I was very disappointed.
40,Enjoyed the stay however I can not believe we have to pay for a fridge after paying $35 per day for a resort fee. This is the most craziest thing I have ever heard. Pool was short staffed so only one of the 4 was open and over crowded. Overall good stay. enjoyed the hotel price and options in hotel.
10,Room was updated but not a quality job. TV was old carpet was dirty and the room smelled stale. Found multiple bugs in our room including a large cockroach in our bathroom. Not much more to say. You get what you pay for I guess.
10,Don’t book at any MGM hotels if you need a cool temperatured room to sleep in. Their ac is controlled by motion sensors. Also if the window cleaners are cleaning the night of your stay expect tons of loud noises.
20,Hotel is dated which I could overlook. But the layers of dust when you look down from the guest hallways....that no doubt contributes heavily to the stuffy poor air quality....not so easily ignored. AC not the best problematic hot water. Cumbersome check in process with looooong lines unless phone app is used which then requires you use a frustratingly glitchy digital key to access elevators and room. Cost was too high for the low level experience. After this one night we spent the rest of our trip elsewhere.
50,Awesome hotel hospitality was awesome everyone I came in contact with treated me wish respect and kindness this will be my go to place in Vegas from now on. Valet parking attendants were awesome as well
40,My first time staying here left a memorable impression. We enjoyed ourselves so much Rooms have no fridge or microwave but overall good to sleep in. Our bathroom had a soak tub and separate shower  parking on lower level is a nightmare definitely park on upper level and you'll be glad parking is not free to staying guest which it should be! casino floor is nice pool area is super nice! All in all i had an awesome time and Definitely will be back
40,I’ve stayed at Luxor a few times. Decent hotel and rooms for the cost. Good food options. Hotel is at the Southern most part of the strip so tough to walk to other places. Pool area is nice with cabana options available. Spa is nice but some amenities were broken like the steam rooms and jacuzzi jets so that was disappointing.
40,Not a great room and the bathroom was severely lacking and not the most exciting casino. However a totally fine quick stay for a cheaper price and if like me you’re not looking to spend a lot of time in the room or in one place then the Luxor is totally fine place to stay.
10,location was poor to far from everything. Buffet not open monday and tuesday. when open it closed at 3pm everyday and over priced . Forced people to ONLY swim in one of their POOLS most of the day because of maintenance
40,The bedroom in the suite was was warm AC not pumping like it should during the summer. Water maintenance in middle of night caused particles and white setiment to come out when i Was about to brush teeth
40,Got the queen rooms. Rooms and bathrooms were spacious and clean in both rooms that my group booked. Check in was seemless and the hotel has plenty to offer. Only gripes were no mini fridge( though I'm told that's pretty standard for Vegas) and the TV in the rooms are pretty outdated( the one in my room would blow it's speakers if you raised the volume above 20). Not a huge gripe since we were barely in our rooms the entire trip.
40,Great music lots of games good sports book excellent staff…especially the bartenders. The second floor has great Mexican food Diablo Cantina. Downstairs had an awesome sports bar and grill. The food was amazing at both spots.
50,Enjoy every stay at Luxor and the more I visit the more enjoyment. Staff is incredible and layout is just perfect. Food is great and restaurants provide excellent service. Looking forward to another trip next month.
10,I spent last Saturday night at the Luxor And I paid a late check out fee.  On Sunday morning housekeeping was knocking on the door. I screamed twice that the room was occupied but he still opened the door he said he couldn’t hear.  I went downstairs to talk to front desk and And she said she would remove the late Check out fee (not enough but I just wanted to go back to bed) and she said would talk to housekeeping about it.  I want back to the room to try to get some sleep. At 11:05 am housekeeping was knocking on the door again I ran to the door before he opened it because my wife was getting dressed.  This means front desk didn’t care about what happened and didn’t communicate to housekeeping.  I wouldn’t recommend this place if you want to have fun and rest the next morning. Specially if you’re paying over $300
10,When you make Circus Circus look good lol It was beyond dirty and was so inconvenient. There is nothing I would rather do then jump out my hotel room then stay at the Luxor. Go anywhere throw a rock in any direction and you’ll find a better casino.
10,Quick summary: I elected to use virtual check in and digital key which was a great idea but didn't pan out as expected. The digital key when used to operate the elevator was faulty and caused me and my 6 year old to have to use emergency staircase just to get to correct floor. Didn't have spare time to go to front desk to deal with problem until second day so was forced to use stares several times. Front desk did not care not offer any kind of compensation and when I requested the manager they have me 4 vouchers for champagne. I do not drink and my other guests were minors. Anything you need to purchase was ridiculously expensive. The inconvenience and annoyance of dealing with this place has made me not want to ever come to Vegas again!
50,Was pleased with all except the cashier at the buffet. Room was clean. Showers were nice. View was amazing casino was beautiful. Casino workers were amazing. Staff was incredible helpful. The food at the buffet was good.
20,"Pictures below are some of the mess left in our room when we first arrived. Rude staff and hotel room was disgusting on arrival. When housekeeping came to ""clean"" it they made the bed and emptied the trash cans that was all. Left hair and trash in the bathroom used nipple pasties on the floor just gross"
20,I have a 130 charge on my card which I can’t even make an explanation for or add up to to make it make sense as well as a 60 dollar one I keep trying to reach out and get an answer and no one has helped it’s been super frustrating. I never even got a bill when I checked out on the app.
40,For the price I paid the room  Was really spacious and nice. I was disappointed that there was no mini fridge and I was very disappointed that there was no guest robes. I would have taken my own robe from home if I knew. Before arriving I did mobile check in which was convenient. I also paid for early check in times. I was disappointed that my room was not ready until 2pm which I would have not paid for early check in. Bell desk did keep my luggage but they had no option to have a bellman deliver it to my room. So after arriving to Las Vegas at 10am and waiting around then deciding to explore and not waste my day on a room to be open I come back near normal check in time and have to carry my own bags to my room. That really was upsetting and a total waste of money.
10,I spent $50000 on my players card account at your sports book this weekend. I asked multiple supervisors for buffets or my room comped & literally received NOTHING. Absolutely ridiculous. $50000 at your book & you cant so much as comp a 2 night stay @ $400. I will NEVER stay eith Luxor again or any other MGM property. I'll gladly take my business back to Ceasers.
10,Hotel employee People are very rude. Check-in was smooth but science i have start staying on this hotel room floor was very dirty. bed were not organized. No refrigerator in hotel room and very poor wife service
10,The security gaurd wanted me to prove I was disabled and followed me around the whole casino whenbi wouldn't. Not only is this rude hut its illegal. The hotel and casino are very nice but to be discriminated against because I'm disabled is ridiculous I want a full refund.
30,For the weekday price can't complain too much. Midsized so nothing seemed too far or confusing to navigate. However sink was clogged water pressure low for cold water and with no fridge pests started appearing despite food containers being closed.
50,Great value friendly staff beautiful rooms. I stayed here in 2005 and now that I'm a Vegas local was very excited to have an opportunity to stay on the strip and totally enjoy the full NFL experience.
30,The staff were really nice and helpful with what we needed.  I was surprised for what we paid for the room that there was a broken chair in it and no fridge.  Worst check-in experience ever between the MGM App and lobby. Takes FOREVER to check in.
50,Always love staying at Luxor. Yes it is near the end of the strip but it is still easy enough to get to other places. Looking fwd to coming down again once hockey and football start...close to stadium and arena
20,Luxor seems you would be paying for a well designed room. The room seem of poor quality and beds were sunk in. Also the description given was two queen beds but were acrually full size. I was expecting more out of my stay.
40,Housekeeping staff is on top of their game! Room was exceptionally clean! The Blue Man Group was the best show I have seen in Vegas! I would suggest to check in on the mobile app the line to check in was long at all times if the day must be a popular hotel!!!!
40,Reasonably priced. Great service. They should upgrade to self check in kiosks. The beds are kind of low to the ground. The pyramid cafe had the worst food of all the places I've tried in the area. Other than that... no complaints really. Great value for budget friendly travelers.
10,They charged me double then they tried to charge again. Then when i tried to resolve it they had security escort me and my guest out. The manager was terrible and I would never stay there again.terrible
50,Stay was great. Service was nice staff was friendly. Room was clean and cleaned everyday. Room was roomy and spacious. Staff responded very quick and timely. I would bery much so book again with luxor.
40,I am a breastfeeding mom and had no where to put my pumped milk. I had to go buy a cooler and watch it often to make sure milk stayed cold. When ice got low I had to walk to the other side of the floor and refill the cooler. Wish they had a fridge. This would have saved time and money when we was on our family trip
50,This is our second stay here and we love it. We feel safe there and the staff is amazing. With the MGM app you don’t even have to use the front desk for checking in and out. Will definitely be back! Highly recommend a day at the pool it’s amazing and the staff were fantastic. This was by far our best trip to Vegas.
20,Room floor was soaked with water used condom on the floor bathtub looked like some took a bath in it. However the front desk staff was great they moved my room. 2nd room had red spots all over the floor room was a little cleaner. We ended up going to CVS to get cleaning supplies and we cleaned the room ourselves whoever gets that room next will be happy.
50,This hotel is affordable and easy to navigate. The staff is friendly the only slight minus is the elevators take a few minute but it is not something that will ruin your stay. The titanic exhibit is exquisite.
40,Service could be better more amenities should be included. No shopping available not enough restaurants no vegan or vegetarian options. Walking to connecting hotels for these opportunities were difficult due to my disability
50,My stay at the Luxor was great truly enjoyed the hotel it was clean and all the staff was friend had a room in the west tower very clean my friend and I ate twice at Delanos and once at the public they both were very good strongly recommend the two...  .
10,Rooms we’re very dirty. Hotel was rundown.I wouldn’t recommend staying here. The price was good but not worth it I’d rather pay more and stay in a clean hotel. There were dirt marks on the doors on the light switches on the walls. They must do the minimum when cleaning the rooms.
40,Will stay again at Luxor but may try to stay out of the pyramid and possibly get a higher quality room. Would of like to have a refrigerator in the room. Will check into more expensive rooms next trip.
30,My biggest problem is no coffee maker in the room you have to walk a long way to get coffee first thing. The A/C in the room is completely useless keep the drapes closed or it will heat it up like crazy. Some things are broken and just not taken care of if I was in charge things would cleaned up immediately!! Painted and looking like someone cared about it
10,This hotel is extremely busy and understaffed customer service never answers the phones and the lines to get to customer service are ridiculous. The rates were really cheap this week and I see why. There are no refrigerators in the rooms and when you request one they give you the smallest refrigerator if possible it didn’t even hold a half a gallon of milk for my child. The housekeeping staff was amazing but the food in all of the restaurants and stores are severely overpriced.
50,I had a marvelous experience while staying at the Luxor Hotel. It was an amazing experience being my first time in Vegas. I would definitely go back and stay again in the same place! Viva Las Vegas all year round!
20,Room was pretty dirt bathroom had hair everywhere and the tub was nasty. The shower drain was backed up and stunk really bad. There's no refrigerator or coffee maker. Apparently towels are a commodity as service left our dirty one on the ground and didn't give us new ones. They have a massive pool but only had 1/4 of it open for some reason. Staff was friendly so not all bad but the room is just not worth it and not what I thought my first MGM stay would be.
40,I will say the check in line was very long and I had issues checking in with the MGM App but one of the staff members told me to log into the app again and what do ya know I checked in early and 10 mins later I got a notification that my room was ready so I got a physical set of keys as well as my digital key. The negative was the West tower elevators we a little bit of a walk but other than that the ro was clean and smelled great
20,Arrived today and welcomed by surly staff - we stood in the wrong line - Our fault I know- but to be be told to move to the other line when there was no one it -POINTLESS!. Luggage guy rude unable to lift light suitcases my husband asked where to write to his name and the gentlemen said ‘here where it says name- got it!!’ Rooms not ready at 3.00pm had to make several visits to reception eventually took residence at 4.15 please note they will take your money quickly!! In the pyramid carpets in halls stained and dirty and if you look over the balcony dirty roof tops littered with various bits of rubbish - the rooms are large and tired- carpets don’t fit to the walls around air con no fridge and the marble top glued together. The hotel concept architecture amazing - rooms blahhh front of house staff rude and ignorant!!  Stay again why when the competition in the area is so much better!
50,We went on a trip with my family and we had a great time at the Luxor rooms were super clean customer service was on point and staff was super friendly and helpful. We highly recommend this Hotel if you're looking for a great experience this is the place.
10,May be just my room but the Air conditioner never worked and I was never helped to resolve it. They called literally me at 3am to look at the AC when I was about to check out at 9am the same day. Just Avoid them you will get better stay anywhere else for that price!
40,The Luxor is a great place to stay if you really don’t wanna go very many other places. It is a long walk to get to the tram. Or if you want to go somewhere you might as well Uber it but an average will cost you about $15 a trip. And that does add up. The rooms are nice clean and the staff was friendly
20,hotel has not been kept up as well as it should have trash on the outside of building things like that should be picked up more then once a day. security was non existing on the outside of building people smoking weed by the front of building .. inside ok but expect more from a 250$ night hotel
40,I had a nice stay for an incredibly reasonable price! I think areas of the hotel could use some work and the rooms aren’t very modern but other than that I don’t have any other negative comments. I would definitely stay here again.
50,Amazing experience at the Nurture spa and the beds were some of the most comfortable we’ve ever slept in. We wish there was a microwave and coffee maker in the room (although the fridge was appreciated) and we wish the pool had a deeper/longer section for doing laps. It seemed like a lot of services took longer than necessary and cost more than anywhere else but overall it was a positive experience and we loved the Egyptian theme and unique architecture.
10,When I checked in the room was never cleaned after the previous guest. The bathroom even had vomit in it. When I went to the guest service representative she was not very surprised or apologetic. She said “this happens all the time”. Gross! I asked for a different room and asked for the room to be close to the elevator because my mother is disabled. I think she completely ignored me and assigned us a room on the completely opposite side of where the elevators are. I was so disappointed that they didn’t make their mistakes up to us. Self parking is not handicap friendly so we had to use the valet service which cost me extra on top of the self parking fee. I would go back if they made it up to me but I’m not holding my breath.
50,The tower rooms were awesome. Bed was comfortable and room was clean. Downside though there was no fridge in the room and I was not able to use my digital key in the elevator even when it shows “use digital key”
50,I had no issues at all at the hotel excellent service and had a great time. But I would have been nice if they provided a gift or card in my room for my birthday as an acknowledgment or provided complimentary bottle of champagne or wine as a gift.
30,This is our first time in Vegas .  The hotel is fine. A little tired but everything works.....so far.  Food and drink is expensive as you would expect so go out onto the strip.  But the biggest let down is the pool area.  I didn't expect to be charged 200 - 300 dollars for a sun bed. And that's without any area's of shade.  Total rip off.  You really are taking the piss Luxor.
50,Using the app that allows my phone to check in and be the room key saved so much time never stood in line went right to my room. It was convenient for my bliss as well. Great shower and great hotel.
30,Older outdated rooms are warm with ac on the hallways and elevators are outdated and dirty the food choices are limited and expensive. Would not stay here as other hotels and casinos offer better rooms at competitive prices
40,Good stay! Good location and plenty of things to do and things to see at Luxor.  Room was good but would recommend modernizing the rooms with upgraded technology. Will Stay again when I return in the fall.
40,Only bad thing was pool closes at 6. Was a very exciting time. Hotel was within walking distance of some exciting things to see. The pyramid style hotel was very interesting. The elevators run at a 39 degree angle.
50,Make sure you visit the bar in the day and Ask for Tom... he is so helpful in asking for things to do and where to eat.... and makes a fabulous drink!    The backstage deli is always a hit late at night or early am.... for some pretty darn great food!
50,I have been to Luxor multiple times and I am a very loyal guest of there membership rewards program as a Noir Member. There are a few people who stand out in there casino staff that I always take notice of and look forward to seeing because they are always so pleasurable to me and make sure that I am taken care of to the best of there ability as then can. So I wanted to say thank you to these casino staff members for always taking care of me and putting up with my requests. Marco Wunn (floor supervisor) Melinda Harris(Dealer/Floor supervisor) and John Couvrette (Dealer) and there are a few more that I do not have the names of. So next time when you are visiting Luxor please be on the lookout for these specific staff members and they will try to take care of you the best possible way they can because that is what I experience every time I visit there property.
10,The bellhop was extremely rude to us. I would not go back to this hotel after the way this man spoke to us. We requested and paid extra for a king room and received 2 queen room. The lines to check in are extremely long.
40,Very expensive. Clean room and like it .self parking was very congested and need to improve and very hard to find too. Need proper sign board casino looks clean . Elevator is very jerky and scary. Other wise no issues while staying
20,We specifically booked a pyramid room for our daughter's birthday trip as she really wanted this for her 21st birthday experience. Not available for our first night really sad. Not much else one can say.
50,Pyramid premium rooms were nice and large. Bed was comfortable. All food and drinks ordered at Pyramid Café we’re great and good portion size. Bottomless bloody Mary’s & mimosas available. Went for brunch before Raiders Game!!
50,It was nice staff got us in early since our flight came in early. Pools where good we stayed in the pyramid rooms nice and very quite.. A lot of good places to eat.. Casino was nice and clean..would stay again
40,We traveled on a family vacation. The hotel is unique but a little dark--could use more lighting. Long check-in lines but the employee who checked me in was very friendly helpful and informative. She took extra time to place our family on the same floor in nearby rooms when she learned we were together. The restaurant staff were also friendly and accommodating. They could do a better job cleaning the rooms. Also we rented a cabana and the fridge was dirty and the trash from the previous day was still in all of the cabanas on our row. There was no fridge in two of the three rooms we rented although there was a space for one. At their prices a fridge should be standard. Our safe didn't work but thankfully nothing was taken. The free tram stops at the Luxor and it's near shopping on the south side of the strip. Overall it was an enjoyable stay and we'd stay there again.
20,Dated rooms and not so great size .Resort looks great from outside..inside its not so great.rooms were smelly.wouldnt recommend families to come and stay here.Good thing it easily connects to Excaliburand Mandalay bay
30,We stay here for game days at Allegiant Stadium for the convenience to walk across the bridge. The rooms are well maintained for the room cost. Make sure you select the room with the mini fridge option included if needed since they do not come standard in every room.
30,Older hotel at the beginning of the strip  Pool closes at 6pm but they make everyone leave at 545pm  The air does not work in the rooms so if you go in the summer you will be hot  Location was good and casino did not have waitress to serve alcohol
10,The air purification system in the room was beyond dirty. I needed to remove the 1/4 inch of dust rinse the screen just to have fresher air in the room. The added $$$ to have this room was completely not worth it. When I showed the pictures to the front desk and then to a manager the manager did not even speak to me or apologize for the lack of cleanliness. I would not recommend that type of room unless you want to clean your own purification system.
20,We have stayed at the Luxor once before in 2013 and had a great time staying in one of the towers.  This time we had a pyramid room which I was looking forward to staying in.  The room itself was clean and the bed was really comfortable. I’d read beforehand that there was no coffee machine but wasn’t really bothered so didn’t expect one which was fine. Lots of toiletries and lovely towels.  However….be aware that every night they clean the outside of the Pyramid windows and you WILL be woken up by them moving across the outside of the building outside your room. It is very noisy and a rude and unnerving sound when you hear it for the first time! The lifts outside our room were also extremely noisy!  We complained about this to the staff and there were very unhelpful. They said we should have had a note about the cleaning of the outside in our room but we didn’t. They offered us a meal voucher but we were leaving so wouldn’t have been able to use it. Reluctantly after my husband suggested it they reimbursed our resort fee.  In short I would definitely go and see the Luxor if you haven’t experienced it before. If you intend to be out all night living it up and sleeping all day then you’ll probably be ok. However it’s noisy in the pyramid rooms at night and the customer service is definitely lacking.  We won’t be staying here again and will not recommend to others.
10,Unless you like overpaying for disgusting rooms waiting on endless lines and eating overpriced and candidly wretched food this might not be the best hotel for you.    Candidly you'll get better quality in a Greyhound bus bathroom and better customer support at your local DMV.
50,We’ve vacationed here for 20 years and rarely leave the building. Drinks slots people watching helpful staff make our stay relaxing and fun. I’ve referred many friends and family members here and they are repeat customers!
20,Stay somewhere else . Not worth the money. Location was convenient but this hotel is in need of serious upgrades. There were not a microwave or refrigerator in the room. And the room smelled of marijuana upon check in
40,Had a lovely family holiday at the Luxor. Loved the impact of the hotel on our arrival. Room was clean well presented and majority of staff at luxor and mandalay bay were great - chatting to us about where we were from and what our plans were. Didn't appreciate exta charges per night when we arrived as feel these should be included in price. Pool area could do with upgrade as loungers not great and minimal parasols (which is annoying when u have just paid extra resort fees to use pool) so would expect these as standard. Did feel Las Vegas as a whole has become overpriced (example $11 for a beer at pool and expectation of tip too) . However had a lovely family holiday have created some super memories which is the most important thing. I would stay here again if pricing was rectified. Don't appreciate unnecessary add ons when I arrive. Just tell us the full price so it's all paid by the time I get there and save time at check-in after a very long flight.
20,Service in certain areas and bars were horrible. Some staff very rude and not enjoyable. Rooms are so outdated rundown and dirty in areas. Didn’t have hot/warm water for 2 days. Location is not ideal depending on what your going to do or look for. Overall will never stay here again unfortunately.
20,Rooms smell like marijuana and the bathrooms are poorly designed. The bathtubs clog easily and spits out crap from the plumbing. Casino is nice but skip the rooms. Stay somewhere else but gamble here.
10,I don't have to go into details about what I didn't like you have people in the hotel by the elevator doing meth and your security lazy your room air-conditioning does not work properly your maids just walks in people room without permission
30,Fourth trip to Vegas. Tried Luxor. Will not again. Housekeeping left a lot to be desired. Had long black hair in shower when we arrived. Wife and I do not have black hair. Did not replenish some items daily. Hotel is older and in need of significant updating. Better shopping and food in adjacent hotels i.e. mandalay bay. Excalibur
10,Best Friends Birthday Trip was completely ruined staff wasn't helpful what so ever. I really hope we can get some kind of answers or something for our future trips back to Las Vegas. This was our 2nd trip this year.
40,Nice place. You’ll have to pay for parking that sucks but I like the Luxor. Good shows and food. Nice casino. Clean rooms. Staff is friendly. My view sucked but there’s better views there you may have to ask.
50,Was very friendly and helpful also went out of the way to help answering questions that I had about the hotel. Room service was super nice my room was very clean. Hotel is in great location. I will stay here the next time I’m in town
50,I stay and play at the Luxor nearly every time I visit Vegas. Always stellar service with clean and comfortable rooms. I enjoy the proximity and easy access to other MGM properties son8 have plenty or dining and entertainment options.
10,The room was very dated and not worth the price to stay there. For a king suite you would expect the room not to look like it was from the 1970s. You would expect the bathroom to be clean of all gunk and grime. You’d at least expect a minibar but there was none. The people down in the lobby harass you to go to a timeshare presentation they are justvultures. The parking garage barely worked and employees would have to stand at the gate letting people in and out when it is supposed to be controlled by the app. I would give the hotel 0 stars if I could but 1 star will suffice for this review.
10,The room is as messy and dirty the staff was rude no one from the front desk or concierge ever picked up the phone the elevators are rickety and don’t feel safe it will very few if any maps of the hotel to get around.
50,loved the hotel and the ambiance. as well as the front desk being excellent when we wanted to check in! loved the service! the casino was also really amazing and the drinks were absolutely delicious. the atmosphere was also very welcoming.
10,Was here on business and I swear had to have received one of the worst rooms. across from the first floor elevators and the public restrooms and it was a handicapped room as well. I got little sleep any of the nights there (3 nights total) and the rooms are just run down. paint over old damaged wood. outdated finishes etc. No way I will stay here again.
50,This place is the best value on the strip. Stay in the tower whenever you can. Clean room. Quiet halls. Great staff. Easy access to rideshare area. I was able to check in early at no extra cost. Great experience
30,I've visited before but never stayed. This time I had 3 nights free from my MGM rewards. The room was clearly a new remodel it was spacious enough and we were right across from the vending machine. Our room was a hike from the elevator and many are it's just the design. But it was not super noisy the staff we met were all friendly and professional. It's a plus that you can walk to Mandalay Bay or Excalibur. Clearly the hotel could use some attention I saw wall paper peeling in the hallways scuff marks etc. The casino floor was laid out nicely fun games and a Starbucks you can mobile order from. We saw AGT live which is at the hotel and that was great. This is a good casual hotel if you are not super picky.
50,The staff were very accommodating and were able to find use a one room suite and a double queen adjoining room for our family of 6 so we weren’t in two separate two separate towers. Will stay there again
50,Great location and I really liked the suite in the West towers we loved the pool area my husband loved the gym and the spa we both loved the dining options and I am used to staying at this end (South) of the strip. Easy to access ride share and to hop over to other hotels and shop on Las Vegas Strip.
40,The Luxor was your average Vegas hotel. A couple standard restaurants minimal over priced attractions and unfortunately far from mostly everything on the strip. One good thing is they had excellent customer service.
20,"Stayed Friday and Saturday nights. Room was large but floors were uneven furniture worn and just in general felt out of date. The ""Early Alert System"" went off for several minutes at 4AM Sunday morning ruining our nights sleep. Mobile key works great when you have service but the elevator shafts where you need your key to get to your room cause the data to fail. Felt very overpriced for what it was."
50,Our fourth stay at Luxor and there will be more! Staff very friendly and helpful. Casino clean with lots of staff wiping down machines and emptying ashtrays and picking up empty drink glasses. Housekeeping as excellent! Love he location you can get into the strip frenzy or have a more relaxing experience
40,The staff was welcoming and very friendly. We checked in on a Friday and than went to the Casino to play. The cocktail waitress came frequently and was so nice. Our room was clean and the beds were comfortable. The location of our room was tricky to find a bit. We enjoyed the steakhouse dinner but were not so impressed by the buffet. I felt like the buffet was not clean and was quite chaotic. Tge drink station close to our seating was out of orange juice and the hours of operation were bizarre. Over all we had a great stay and will definitely be back.
50,I am a local here in Las Vegas and I certainly recommend The Luxor especially if You enjoy machines and good restaurants!!    I often interact with the slot techs here and they are friendly knowledgeable and fast to help. I want to specifically mention Ken Nelson He goes above and beyond!! Ken N is easy to talk to when ever I have a question about how a machine how it works or simply replacing voucher paper.    Also from My experience MGM Properties are generally looser then other properties!! On the strip and certainly much better then Downtown. I played all over I know!!    I also want to give Marlene Henry a shout out. She manages Public House. This place is amazing and the food is fantastic!! =)    I am very happy with The MGM Rewards Program and I give all MGM Properties a BIG THUMBS UP!!!!
30,Need to change the bed sheets.  They had blood spots at the foot of the sheets. Totally Gross. ***********************************************************************************************************
50,My experience was amazing and enjoyable . I loved the Egyptian theme and the casino was great. I loved the blue man group show and recommend it for everyone. I loved the steak house. The buffet could have been way better tho.
20,No cell phone reception in my room. I had to go all the way downstairs to make a call to check on my blind mother 3 or 4 times a day. Very inconvenient. The resort needs to be reimbursed at the least.
10,The room was a mess and it smelled the service was poor and it took a long time to check in even after I had a reservation I was also charged for a second reservation when my first reservation was cancelled
10,I was charged 2 weeks later for my stay that was comp and they have hidden fees I've had a lot of comp rooms and never had this problem will not be staying again and why is my card information still in you all system
50,We loved our stay at the Luxor. It has everything inside loved the 24/7 Deli in the lobby. It has a pizzeria and sandwich shop open till 5 AM on the second floor. Rooms are very clean and huge. I think parking should be free for guests such as the World resorts and Hilton. Overall it was excellent.
30,Stayed at Luxor because of its proximity to allegiant stadium where I went to see a concert. When I checked in and gave me the wrong Room number didn’t realize until I was upstairs. Then we had to come back downstairs with our luggage. And go back upstairs which made us late for our concert. They did comp me resort fees. However they did charge me for two days and parking. I don’t understand why they can’t just includes parking for hotel guest.
30,Good hotel and would recommend if there is a conference nearby. Wish the hotel provides chairs at the pool area. Guest must pay to sit at the pool. Would have liked to use to the spa and the pool. The Starbucks are at good locations. Room came with a mini refrigerator and no coffee maker or microwave.
50,Luxor has always been an exceptional hotel and Casino the rooms are always clean and the beds are very comfortable the customer service is great as all staff I came into contact with were very pleasant and helpful
40,Like the Luxor because it’s not as huge as others. Easy to get around but it’s older so if you can take that part it’s a good spot to stay and play. Everyone likes to make fun of Luxor because of the age but that just means it does not take 45mins to get from the casino floor to your room.
40,There was a broken tile in bathroom located right above the floor and flushing toilet was loud but staff of hotel were excellent!! The front desk and concierge staff were excellent. They outshined the room 100 percent!
10,This place is the worst I’ve ever stayed at in Vegas I usually stay at aria and I wanted to see how Luxor was and it is the dirtiest and hottest hotel to stay inside. I will not recommend this place to anyone
30,The hotel is further down in the dead end but there are trams you can walk to. The hotel is older and they have a mix of rooms. Usually you can get great room deals because of this. Unfortunately the buffet closed for some of the days we were there and the main breakfast restaurant. Make sure you check before you go. Our kids were older 18 but for little ones there is only the pool for them.
10,- Room was not clean  - Floor was not clean in good condition or vacuumed  - Blood on ceiling  - Blood on bathroom wall  - Floor was wet on the side of the bed closest to the window near air conditioning unit. Hotel was notified but nobody showed up.  - Loud guests across the hall. Hotel was also notified of this issue. Once again nobody showed up. Noise continued the entire stay.  - Emergency notification broadcasted into room. No explanation was given. Didn't know if there was a fire and we should evacuate or imminent danger and should shelter in place.  - Requested a non smoking room but it wreaked of weed. Whole room stunk and it didn't clear up.
50,This trip for my boyfriend bday was amazing! He loved the hotel and barely wanted to leave! It’s was beautiful and the food was amazing! You’ll never have to leave! Definitely coming back! We never stayed in our room more than 4 hours and that was only to shower and sleep
10,Problem: The mattress is old; the room floor is sticky.  The staff is nice and friendly. But the hotel quality Is too bad! If you want a good quality sleep this is not a good a place to come. Not recommended!
30,Staff was great. Comfortable bed. Long walk to everything. Air conditioner in room sucked. Restaurants outside of the food court had bad hours if you weren’t on a strict schedule. It was nice but had some serious drawbacks.
10,Smelled disgusting. One of the rooms I booked we could not stay in because it smelled so bad. Did not get a new room. I will never stay here again. It was not my speed AT ALL. I do not recommend anyone staying here.
50,Things went very smooth which was not a norms lately in the traveling world. We were given our key before we even arrived to the location. It was late and we were able to skip the lines main entrance straight to our room. The directions how to get to your room were accurate.
40,Great room at a great rate. My family enjoyed Staying at the Luxor. The pool was awesome. The staff at the pool was amazing. I truly recommend renting the POD or cabana for larger parties. Totally worth it.
50,Awesome hotel. I love my room with a very nice view to the Pyramid. Very good energy feeling staying on this hotel. I was able to use the Gym on my Saturday morning and there is plenty of exercising equipment for cardio and weight lifting. It might need small updates adn new AB mats but overall it a decent good size gym.
10,Reserved pyramid room upon app checkin was assigned a stupid tower room. Outside noise was loud. Could hear loud stupid music people’s conversations and traffic noise. Very difficult to sleep. Room was clean.
50,Price was great on Groupon. Staff was great and responded quickly to every request. Check in and out process was effortless. Location was also perfect on the strip. Casino staff was friendly and drinks came quick!
30,Stayed here two nights to attend Blackhat conference. The hotel overall seemed old and run down. It needs a refurbish. There was nothing in our room. If you wanted a refrigerator you had to pay for it. There wasn’t even a pen provided. The sideways elevators were neat but slow. Half the restaurants were not even open. I will stay somewhere else when I return to Vegas.
10,Check-in Problem they give a room with another customer stuff still on it or the customer was already there luggage and clothe were stil on the Room. have to go back to check in and the person who made the checking make do the line again in order to assist me even when I explain the situation. Checking person lie to me when ask them about the process to make changes to the reservation. Bathroom water pressure was horrible.  Worst Hotel Experience Ever.
50,This is the second time I stayed at the Luxor. Both times I found the staff to be very friendly and helpful. The rooms were clean and quite. The lounge and drinks were wonderful. I would highly recommend this property.
50,All staff were outstanding and that's why I like to stay at the luxor. Staff are always friendly and helpful and always ready to address your issues. The issue with the keys was a little inconvenient but staff addressed it quickly.
50,Had good eats and a blast roaming around the casinos. The staff were very helpful about any questions I had. They were also very friendly. I had conversations with a few of them and they were very upbeat and seemed like they liked what they were doing.
50,I really have a nice stay at Luxor during the Blackhat 2022 conference. So much so that instead of moving hotels for DEFCON I decided to extend my stay at Luxor. I had an amazing 12 day stay in Vegas and Luxor made me feel at home!
30,Didn't like it associates pushy to get a time share  room  Didn't come with a fridge like said. I'll prob won't be returning or telling anybody about it. There are better hotels on the strip especially from  MGM resorts
50,Very Satisfied with the customer service and the rooms being clean. Front Desk are very helpful. I would recommend it to our friends and family. Thank you for making us feel comfortable we enjoyed our stay.
10,Rooms are very poorly lit LOUD snd needs repairs! Check in is ridiculous! Several understandably angry people waiting in line. Elevators had spills and broken beer bottles. One spill in same elevator all day. Just an overall frustrating experience! Never again!
10,You get what you pay for and for us that was even less. We paid for early checkin and by 1:30 pm only 1 of 2 rooms was ready. That room had sewage coming out of the bathroom sink because they were working on plumbing on adjoining room and nobody told them we were in the room next door. After they tried to move us to another room but none were available they cleaned the bathroom but then the room key stopped working. We went to front desk 5 times and never got a key that worked. Finally had security verify that key did not work for room so they moved us to another room. Wasted most of the day trying to deal with all these issues with the room. Plus the parking we paid for never worked on the room keys so we always had to call and wait for someone to open the parking gate for us. The rooms are run down the elevators were shaking and felt like they were going to fail at any second the location is at the far end of the strip and the tram only stops at Luxor on the way to Excalibur so you have to wait longer than for the other hotels.  Next time we will pay extra to get a nicer room without sewage and with keys that work at a hotel further down the strip. Not worth all the hassles and wasted time trying to deal with all the problems we experienced at Luxor even if the rooms were cheap.
20,It was an okay stay and I wouldn’t say it was terrible but I wouldn’t come back just because my overall experience of other hotels that happen to have my heart like Park MGM & Now Mandalay Bay are amazing !
20,No microwave No refrigerator Hidden resort fees when you get to the hotel (This is not a resort as a resort provides free meals and drinks charged in a resort fee) $80 a day for parking. A fight broke out in which my husband helped management break up. The manager did give us a meal voucher. The hotel lobby smells good.
10,Let’s see - where do I start: When I got there to check-in the lines were extremely long. I was given a room in the west tower on the 14th floor we go up to the room and the room was not cleaned since the last guest left - it was disgusting. I’m happy to provide photos (you’ll also be able to find them soon with our online reviews). My friend staying in the room goes down and waits in the long line again to get a new room but they refuse service and ask that I go down. So I go down and now we were given a new room in the East tower we go up to the room and the room doesn’t have a tv remote nor a “Do not disturb” sign. We weren’t surprised considering the service we had received. We don’t call anyone nor request a remote. However at 1am someone knocks on our door and when we don’t open this man proceeds to open the door himself and enter the room!!!!! I jump out of bed and stop him and he says “oh I have the remote you requested”. I was in disbelief. This was by far my worst experience ever. Never ever coming back. Cherry on top I was promised free parking which I never got
10,Looks like the place hasn't been cleaned since it was built! Scuffs dents elevators and walls falling apart stale air stained carpets holes were people seemed to have punched. Overall cutty and won't stay again!
30,No longer have a fridge in room beds feel like a box with holes. Valet doesn’t charge your electric cars even when they said they will. Restaurants don’t verify who you are when they charge to your room so I was charged for someone else’s meals.
50,This was my sixth trip to Vegas and this time I picked to stay at Luxur. Travelled with kids. The hotel is nice inside rooms were nice. Food court inside is very convenient. Swimming pools were great. A nice stay overall.
20,Don’t stay at Luxor. It is not worth the headache and lack of customer service with so many other options out there on the strip. We were not treated as I expected with the cost of the hotel. Cocktail waitress was so rude when we ordered water vs alcohol. Housekeeping kept skipping our room even with multiple calls for service until the night before we left. I would never stay at this hotel again. I came ready to spend my money here and returned with most of it because I was so turned off by the attitude of this hotel.
10,I've traveled to Vegas for work for over 15 years. This by far was the worst experience ever. First I organized room block of close to 20 rooms for my team and not that I expected preferential treatment but at least a middle of the road room. It might as well have been in the middle of the main road. The noise right next to the elevator and the place is just run down. I would not stay here again and definitely will not recommend it to friends.
50,I would stay again very happy and satisfied with my stay intact I’m thinking of going back soon and planning to stay at the Luxor again. I’m also taking my kids because it’s family friendly. Customer service was great I really didn’t have any issues with the room.
10,"We love the look of the exterior but the hotel was anything but the room was very minimal there was NO handrail in the bathroom we could have easily slipped there was NO fridge our shower was leaking the first night they came to fix it then he said housekeeping should up in a little bit to wipe up the floor that was at about 7 or so it was 11pm we went to bed we were knocked out....AND housekeeping came in she was like ""Hello"" we were like yes we are sleeping what do you want she said ""sorry"" and closed the door oh and that's the other thing there is NO LOCK on the door you simply cannot lock it form the inside it was just a horrible experience DON'T STAY HERE!!!"
50,Much to offer for most ages. I would recommend the Luxor as an affordable  Option for families. I was disappointed to find there was no coffee maker. Or a fridge in the room. I usually look for these amenities.
50,It is an older hotel. So not everything will be perfect. The room waa very clean and the service was excellent by the front desk and the housekeeping staff. Some paint/popcorn ceiling is falling off the ceiling in the shower area. But the bathroom Is immaculate. Food choices are pretty good for a quick meal.
10,Rooms were not prepared.  Un-announced resort fee. No mention at the time of booking.  No mini fridge or coffee in the room.  Long lines at check in and check out.  Guest to staff ratio is low.  Busy loud and not family friendly.
40,Located well to all activities. Travel was easy. Exhibits were nice. Only negative is that the bed was uncomfortable and the bathroom layout was awkward. Staff is very helpful. Next time I might get a regular room. The suite was just ok
50,I went for a solo trip and was a little nervous to stay here based on low reviews. I actually loved my stay. The room was clean comfy and cold. Pool was huge- although the drinks werent' strong. Do no recommend mixed drinks poolside. Bar drinks inside were great. Best part was my spa experience and one hour massage. BEST experience ever.
50,The Luxor was an amazing experience for my stay during the Evolution 2022 Gaming Tournament being hosted next door in the Mandalay Bay! The room was pristine the staff were amazing and cordial and the amenities provided were extremely convenient albeit a bit deal expensive which was the only drawback.
50,I want to go back. It smelled like flower bomb and it was so clean and I just enjoyed the vibe all together. The rooms are super spacious and it didn’t cost an arm nor a leg. My new go to hotel when I stay in Vegas.
50,We stayed here as a couple in August. Really enjoyed our stay mobile check in was quick and efficient.  All staff we dealt with were very friendly and helpful.  We stayed in the east tower. Rooms were spacious & clean. The beds were very comfortable. Shower was really good.  Our room was cleaned every day and fresh towels daily.  Breakfast was good in the pyramid cafe and backstage diner.  Really enjoyed the pool although it was very busy.  Overall a great stay and would highly recommend
50,We always love the Luxor. There's a place upstairs near the shows that has the best chicken. But our #1 experience this time was the Couple's Massage. We got a discount for military which is always nice. I thought it was a bit too pricey... but once we had the massages done well worth it. Then in the spa they provide all you could need to relax pamper yourself and then get ready to move on with your day. My only complaint is that the spa is separated by gender. So as a couple we did not stay long. We wanted to spend time together not separate :(
30,The Luxor is an above average Vegas hotel. The room was spacious and the bed was very comfortable. I did not like that there was no refrigerator in room. It had to be rented. The pool experience was just average.
40,I usually stay here as I love the vibe and the location in the heart of my favourite casinos. I could spend days wandering from MB to Park. I love ground floor rooms as they are convenient and very sound proof. The rooms are clean and well-maintained. This is not a high-end property but the price reflects this.
30,Lines were always long so if you have a problem or just want to ask a question good luck! They need someone at the desk that's only answering questions because when you've already stood in a long line and walked off and realized that they forgot to inform you about something it's too bad also it seems like no one could help you or they just didn't know anything
50,Nice clean hotel...great staff! I stay all over Vegas but for the money Luxor has always been one of my favorites! I love the tower rooms personally and the location is Great! So if you're looking for a nice clean affordable hotel Luxor is it!
20,The room was the only disappointment. Tower king room felt like a cheap off strip motel room. Shower head leaked/sprayed everywhere. Shower didn’t drain well. Shower room wasn’t very clean. Mini fridge wasn’t stocked even with bottle water. Mini fridge didn’t get cold. Tv remote didn’t work
20,With this being an MGM property I had high expectations. I was wrong. The room was very outdated I would wake up in the middle of the night and it seemed like someone was in the room smoking. The room was not clean. The last night I saw what looked like blood on the wall next to the bed. Maybe this was just my room but talking with others they felt the same way.
50,Room itself was very satisfactory and the beds themselves were incredibly comfortable. My partner and I were able to enjoy our stay much more and I highly recommend the Luxor. If we do come back for the same event it will absolutely here
20,friend had a gout attack and needed help - staff sucked at helping us with accommodations room was dirty toilet lid broken and leaking elevators smelled and the floors of it were sticky casino small and not great air circulation.
30,I stayed in Tower East. It could feel a little isolated on the walk to the elevators should be more lighting. No coffee machine in the room. No mini-bar. Guessing covid could be a reason for that but it really sucked.
10,I was checked into a room that had a sewerage issue. The toilet 🚽 seat was leaking and the whole room was stinking like hell. I immediately called the front desk to move my room. The front desk took care Of it but the lock was broken and not knowing I got to know the second day that door was not getting closed at midnight; the security called someone to get this fixed. I am extremely disappointed with MGM properties highly unsatisfied.
30,There are much nicer hotels on the strip in this price range. Hotel feels past due for a refresh in the rooms and elevators. Mobile check-in/out was a positive feature with the digital keys. The option for early check-in/out was another bonus for the MGM property.
20,My phone was lost at one point. Find my iphone pinged it at front desk for over 24 hours. Staff told me there protocol was to turn anything lost to security immediately. We had to surround desk until we heard it and demand to get it back! Then supervisor was rude. It had been there the entire time. Can't trust staff!
30,My wife and I took our vacation to the Luxor in Las Vegas. We had a horrible experience at check in. Mobile app didn't work just said your room is not ready. An hour later I called. Check in was at 3pm... By 4pm still not ready. The lady on the phone said I can't help you you'll have to stop by the desk. We had to the desk. There is a huge line and a very aggressive lady who told my wife she couldn't wait in line with me. After 15 mins I get to the clerk and ask does my reservation show the deal I got through mgm rewards. Her response I can't help you... I've never had bad service at a luxury hotel till now. My advise avoid the Luxor. I complained and they made no attempt to fix the situation.
20,"Lots of little things just show a lack of attention to details that make a rest wonder. No really big issues but the lack of one thing that was a good positive you want something in Vegas that gives you a ""wow"" every now and then. (Other than the toilet paper. The toilet paper was really nice. Kinda crazy huh?) Beds were good. Or I was just dead tired from long days at a conference and entertaining."
40,IMy stay was the first of more to come at The Luxor. It my Mother's 82nd birthday and she wanted to go to Las Vegas for a show. I went on line to make reservations and purchase show tickets. All was done in a mayter of minutes. The ease of use was what made this simple for me. My mother loved the connecting suite and the show. She left Las Vegas happy and said she hadn't experienced Las Vegas like that ever. Thank You to the staff of The Luxor
10,Horrible experience that’s all I’ll say! Staff is not friendly nor reliable to be trusted when asking simple questions! They don’t like to help their guests and could care less if your problem becomes the next staff members issue to handle. They like to pass on issues to the next staff member and don’t like to help you solve it right away! Never again! EVER AGAIN!!
50,Love it here because it’s away from all the riff raff. Since it’s so separated from the strip if you don’t belong there you won’t be walking all the way over there for nothing. Wish there was room service or extended hours eat Luxor cafe
40,Love this place. Always a good experience. Nice views really nice rooms for the price. Easy access to the duece bus and the pool was not overcrowded. Checking in and out is also pretty fast with no hassle. Friendly staff
10,This place seemed like it was falling apart and hadn’t been updated since the 90s. Stained popcorn ceilings that were crumbling and falling apart. Large gross exposed air vents covered in layers of ash and dust. Just gross. TVs froze multiple times at the Sportsbook and the room tv had crackling sound issues. The staff was friendly so that was a positive.
50,Great place to stay and very nice people very close to all the places we visited bus stop out front is very helpfull when going places with out a car short 30 min rode to Fremont st and plenty of stops on the route to get to other casinos
40,Group of us went to Vegas for a Gay stag do  11 of us altogether from across U.K / Ireland USA & Australia.  Had a couple of suites if possible I would recommend the one bedroom suite actually in the pyramid it was massive!  I was suitably impressed with it.  All in all the Luxor is fine you get exactly what you pay for.  My positives - The app its a dream you don't need to queue to check in you can use it to open your bedroom door check out keep track of what you're spending.  Negative - Its a little dated and I was not keen of the fact at the pool there is no free shade. As a pasty white Irish boy I could not sit out by the pool for fear of going even redder!
50,Amazing experience. Very fun and awesome. Lots of good places to eat and drink. Room was clean and very big really enjoyed it. Will be staying there again in the future. I recommend this to everyone. Yes
30,The experience was fine for the price. The floor smelled very strongly of cigars constantly compared to other casinos. The aggressive upselling at arrival and departure is definitely my least favorite hotel business model and this happened to us here. The staff were friendly and it’s not on them it’s on management and ownership to change their business model to pay those staff members well without them needing to earn pay by invading tired travelers’ space. It comes off predatory and manipulative. I want to make a purchase consciously not be surprised or overwhelmed into making a purchase. It just comes of seedy at best and predatory at worst. Also had real trouble with getting the digital key to work and several elevator buttons were broken. The walk was quite long to and from the elevators from both the floor and the room. The air conditioner kept resetting our temperature to about 76 after several hours. Fine if you’re on a budget and just want somewhere to sleep/shower. But if you want a pleasant overall experience or to spend time awake in the hotel itself I’d say look somewhere else.
20,The area in hotel is good.  However the wall is so thin you can hear the room next door. Also I got allergy so bad while I was staying at the hotel. I have to check out one day earlier of my departure date. I cannot stay any longer in the hotel because of the allergy.
10,The hotel is not clean the hotel is dated. I had some plumbing issue in my room.  The elevator was always covered in garbage. Book only if you have no other choice. Only bright side the staff is  Friendly.
50,Enjoyed my stay again! Always a great value with nice casino floor. Tender steakhouse is great for dinner and The Pyramid Cafe for breakfast. Close to Allegheny Stadium if you are a Raiders fan also. Large pool area and friendly staff. Recommend!
50,Went out for a family trip. The Luxor was great. Clean rooms with lots of entertainment in the hotel. Great friendly and safe feeling inside of the casino with lots of restaurants and intertainment around.
10,The smell in the room and the hotel was disgusting- my room was filthy- and there was an overwhelming spell of bad air freshener -like they were trying to mask 30 years of stale cigarette smoke and must. There air freshener was being pumped into the room 24 hours a day- it gave me a raging headache. I checked in and received two room keys that didn't work so I tried the digital key and that didn't work either so went back downstairs only to be told I had to wait in the regular check in line that was 20 people deep to get a new card. There were 3 other people standing behind me with the same problem so we all had to wait 20 minutes in a line just to get a new room key. The kiosks didn't work either. The staff was not apologetic nor empathetic. The hotel itself is clearly run down and the general areas and smell was gross. I was apparently given one of the newly remodeled rooms and if that was a remodel I can't imagine what the regular rooms look like. Certainly not anything like the picture on web-site. The carpet and walls in the room were also filthy. This is the first and last time I stay at the Luxor
50,First time staying this hotel n it was good experience for me. its pretty cool celebrating my birthday. anyways it's been over ten years i haven't visited Las Vegas. i'm surprised that it got hotter last time i visited.
50,Have been staying there for years and years never mind ver have I had anything less than a great experience. I am absolutely looking forward to my upcoming return next month.The staff is always pleasant but their APP makes checking in super easy.
40,Straight forward hotel mobile check in is a plus when you don’t want to sit in long lines. Never had to go to the desk! Enjoyed the spa. Food court and buffet are convenient. Easy to navigate and find Uber or taxi areas.
20,checkin was awful disrespectful room downgraded but charged full price  Room not clean  elevator falling apart  Very bad stay.  I picked this hotel because I had good stay in 2019 but it seems that nothing is maintained and front desk at night treat customers like crap.
30,The placed smelled like pot. As soon as the elevator doors opened it was like walking into the 70s....if you're allergic to smoke you'll choke on pot all-night.    Pot is fine for most but does raise blood pressure. If you have hbp be careful.
20,As convenient as the hotel was to my conference The rooms and the experience were not the best. I would expect the hotel to keep not only the rooms but the shops and aesthetics up to date. This was not the case.
50,We stayed at the Luxor for 5 nights. The Tower Suite was beautiful the view was Awesome. Amazing floor to ceiling windows. The 3 pools are gorgeous. The casino was hot. The drinks were cold. We LOVE this hotel.
50,Price to stay reasonable. Very clean rooms. Staff were professional respectful and very friendly. Within the hotel great shows to catch. Family and I were extremely satisfied with our stay. Would definitely stay here again.
20,I’ve stayed in some nice and bad places before… this is one of the worst. My room felt gross and not clean. There was a gross mystery stain on my sheets bugs flickering lights wet towels on arrival weird shower layout poor choices for restaurants to stay at. The layout of the hotel is crazy difficult to grasp at first with poor signage. The hotel is gloomy through and through. Made me just want to go back to my room and sleep.
10,Depressing is the best word to describe the state of the Luxor. Elevators are all damaged in someway and some don't function. Sharpie marker used to tell you what floor button to push...    Lobby is dark attractions are all closed. Staff is unhelpful management uncaring that the place is falling apart.    Part of the MGM portfolio probably ok at 30$ or less but if there is something at Mandalay they gouge so check elsewhere...    and they charge a resort fee... complete insult.    The only positive was the sheets were clean...
10,Not only was I given the gift of an unclean room including what I can only assume was a human molting their pubic hair but after repeated attempts of asking for help little to nothing was done.    I waited on hold multiple times with a phone I can only believe was unattended. Making it better was multiple times on the loop after finding other peoples pubic hair around what you want a to be on hold for more than 20 minutes and then faked out by an add that goes “hello hello” making it sound like they are trying to pick up the phone multiple times. Most likely because I was on hold longer than their “target” times.    Just a bad experience all around. Couple that with the elevator of doom and slowness and and poor noise and light blocking we don’t have a winning system.    On the plus the Starbucks is less attended so the shortest wait for coffee on the strip.    I’m told the tower is better but anything is better than finding other peoples pubic hair where to are trying to get clean!
30,Pls update elevators. One button to command 4 elevators on each side is outdated. However the staff was exemplary. None of the staff seemed to be bothered by general inquiries and their mood was really good.
40,Very great hospitality and awesome room. I recommend everyone to stay here as the food selections at food courts and the great restaurants like the Public House  and the Buffet where very well staffed and service was wonderful.
40,Hadn't stayed at Luxor in 38 trips to Vegas because I've read some bad reviews.. but wow this place was GREAT!! Yes it's considered one of the less expensive MGM casinos but that sure doesn't mean it lacks in anything!! Staff was totally great. Our two rooms were VERY clean nicely laid out and very comfortable! Restaurant choices were very good with great service. If you haven't stayed at Luxor because you don't think it will be great definitely give it a shot! Also.. Titanic exhibit is a total MUST SEE!! One thing I can say for sure.... stay at a MGM casino!!! Far FAR better than the Caesars properties.. and far more generous to guest with players club free play and free food.. plus hotels are MUCH better!
40,"usually a good time- but ekey didn't work elevator----didn't work room - not a huge deal until you have to walk all the way BACK to the front desk and get it fixed----ekey didn't have the elevator location or all the numbers even on the screen..my ""refrig"" was an empty hole in the cabinet- cleaning people left behind not only supplies but empty cups as well - not sure what has happened to this place- buffet not open on mon-tues- i think they are cutting ""costs"" in all the wrong areas"
40,We stayed for two day for a part of our honeymoon it is amazing huge infinity. The room was very confortable and the view very impressive. Very beautiful the swimming poll outside the best way for stay in relax and fighting with hot temperature.
40,Decent but needs improvement We only stay gor 1 night because we missed our flight and that was the cheapest one. Pool closes at the best time of the day at 6pm if Im not mistaken. Location is good because DEUCES bus comes every 10-20 minutes and takes you on a great route to decent places.
10,The worse stay I’ve ever had at a hotel ! I got a allergic reaction due to mold ! Had to see emergency room now have medicals bills didn’t get to enjoy nothing just sick the whole days I am currently on steroids due to this hives and allergic outbreak in my body
10,It wasn't a room it was a dirty dilapidated cave. I feel like we got shoved in the broom closet on the first floor. Everything in the room was chipped dirty and falling apart. The TV had no clear signal. The shower blasted like a fire hose. I have been to Vegas four times this year. There are way better accommodations in this town. My advice go somewhere else.
30,No coffee in the rooms. Toilet paper literally out of reach from toilet. Undulating floors. Poor fit and finish. Nothing in this building is plum true or level.    But the value is good understandably
10,this hotel is out dated. it has mold on the ceilings in the shower. the elevators don't work and are old an swing way to much knocked us around a few times. food was not cooked well or over cooked in the buffet.
50,My connecting flight got cancelled and I was lucky enough to find a room and at a very good price! I will definitely be making a trip to spend more time! Staff was so friendly room was so nice and big!
50,Luxor is the best hotel and great service. The stay felt like home and very welcoming. The room service was great and very polite they stocked our room up and even when we called house keeping they accommodate us. The checkin lobby experience was smooth and easy
50,My stay was unlike any other. It was very enjoyable to be able to drive only 4 hours away to go to a place that was designed for entertainment and relaxation. I am very satisfied with my stay at the Luxor and all of Vegas
30,It was ok but definitely the room was dated and needs some repairs. The plumbing made noises you can hear folks in the next room but also the shower had visible cracks and the rubber padding was peeling off. The carpet didn't smell so clean either. But this is a moderate hotel in price and is quite far from the main areas of the strip so you just gotta go with it. Not bad Not the best. Just okay.
10,Room was gross. Blood on Wall. Water stains on ceiling. Shower did not drain. 78 degrees in room. Stay anywhere but here on your visit. Thank goodness I only booked for 1 night and was not there long.
20,Our key wouldn't work and we went to the room 5 different times and came back down to desk every time and they said we went to the wrong elevator. But after the 5th time found out we were at the right elevator the whole time. We had to drag our luggage up and down 5 times just for them to listen and give us working keys.
10,Someone broke into our room and stole items and distributed all bags  Tossed everything around and nothing has been replaced to date  I really think that if the maids enter your room they must ensure that the room is secured when exiting
10,the room was smelly the ac wasn't cooling as it said on the wall unit room ran warmer . there were no tissues you could tell no one cleaned the room there was like 5 sheets on each bed they didn't change the linen they only put another to cover the other this was legit low end motel quality with a high end price tag I paid more for resort fees than I did for my 2 night stay I haven't been to Las Vegas in a long time since before service fees and resort fees have been emplemented and I honestly may never go back especially this hotel it was a terrible experience and I am going to copy this and use it for a public review I overpayed for garbage in all honesty. but mgm can sleep well knowing they got another sucker while they sit back and fatten their pockets but the guests get the shift at the end I paid a resort fee for no resort amenities the pool closed at 6pm no mini fridge no microwave just a smelly motel room with all the ratty amenities that go with a low end motel.
50,Great price with connection to shops and mandalay bay. Starbucks was long line but fast enough. Frozen yogurt place had machine handles that were broken and out of different flavors paired with 3 lazy female staff members.
30,I was not aware of the additional setup per day fee I got charged when I booked my hotel ($35.00 per day x 7-days) I think is deceiving and I should have been told from the beginning.    Aside from that everything else was good.
10,This is an older building. Double check your AC system or you'll find yourself steaming at 3 in the morning. The elevators move at an angle not the greatest feeling when buzzed. On one occasion the entire elevator jolted to a stop on floor 2 almost everyone inside fell over.
40,The ascetic is great and the elevator is very different. There are lots of food and entertainment options and the location is great! It was a fun experience but the rooms are very basic and not alot of channels on the TV. Room service is very limited and the food at the various places on site at expensive and not worth the price.
10,Paid the extra to stay in a Suite at Luxor. Not impressed at all. Room was dingy and smelled of cigarettes and other bad odor. Everything was so outdated in that room - 12 floor room 320. The brown couch in the suite was stained and smelled horrible. Had to buy air freshener and sprayed the entire 3 days Couldn't tell if the tiles in the bathroom were clean as they appeared to be old and stained. Definitely did not get a relaxing fresh vacation vibe. Disappointed. Positive note...staff were friendly.
10,I had requested connecting rooms (when I called to make the reservation when I called to check-in the day off when I arrive to check-in early) and a view. It didn’t happen. Also I was not allowed to check-in early. The vending machine on my floor remained broken during the duration of my stay. I used the bottom floor vending machine and it ate my money. There was no fridge or coffee maker in our rooms. When I called guest services they wanted to charge me $25 additional for a fridge. Both shower and bathtub were clogged. The repair team left not cleaning up the shower or tub. The cleaning staff didn’t show up till after 3pm when I contacted them. When I came back I found a bag of dirty towels in the shower I had to toss the bag out myself. The toilet made a very loud annoying sound every time you flushed. Starting at 3am there were loud plumbing noises coming from what I think is people taking showers.
50,It was the best experience and very nice hotel I ever stayed at I will be coming back in I definitely will choose to stay at this hotel again it was close to everything so if you decide to choose this hotel please do!!!!
30,Was able to check in early. Room smelled like smoke and no view. And no hot water in the sink. Other than that it’s an ok stay. I got serviced at the spa which was a good experience. The location is good.
50,We saw a concert at Allegiant Stadium and Luxor is a great place to stay because it is just a short walk from the stadium. Also using the indoor walkways to Mandalay Bay and Excalibur gives guests a lot of dining options entertainment choices and a great selection of casino games to play.
10,For a $400 premier room I was expecting a little more. I only had one night in vegas so I was very disappointed in what we got. The beds were comfy bathroom was nice but the towels were thin and cheap. The lamps were a little dusty. Single-use plastic cups in the room with no coffee. Worst of all there was a shoesize large caked in sticky stain/mess in the carpet right by the bed. We went to the Luxor because we read great reviews of the pool but it was run down and a little dirty. The lifeguards were very nice though.
10,The air conditioner wouldn't stay on. It was 105 outside.No hot water so cold showers for 5 days with just a little bit of water pressure.Checking in was a nightmare. Online check in wouldn't work so I waited 1 hr in line to check in to a lady that was just rude. The elevator door close to soon and ripped the skin off half my arm. Never again!
10,We found that the bed sheets were not changed at all and the bathroom is not cleaned the towels in the bathroom has some hairs on it. So we call the front desk they said they are going to send the request to change the bed sheet but they don’t know when. They also said they will waive the resort fee but they don’t. Then after waiting for about 1 hour we fall asleep on the top layer of the sheet then they start to change the bed sheet. The guy change the sheet for us is okay and he did it quickly. But overall this is a horrible night!
40,I stayed at the Luxor about 5 years ago. It was a very good stay. After reading other reviews post pandemic I was a little worried about customer service. Well I must have lucked out because from check-in to departure my service was top notch with only one exception. My TV went out on the very last day of my stay. I called the service desk and was told that someone would be up to look at it. After four hours I gave up and didn't bother calling again. That definitely didn't make or break my trip. Very enjoyable. Hats off to Kitty for her personable and professional attitude during check-in. I arrived tired and exhausted at 2am. Kitty treated me like I was a VIP. I'm not but thanks Kitty!!
30,Old hotel but the rooms are nice. There was no refrigerator or microwave inside my premium King suite. The amenities are great outside of the room. Great pool but it’s only 3ft deep. The Blue Man Group is hosted there and is a must see show!
40,It’s a little south of the main part of the strip but the Luxor was clean and a good value. The staff was nice. Our stay was pleasant. It kind of sucks to have to walk to Mandalay Bay to play poker. And even then MB poker room is closed two days a week. Bring back the poker rooms!
50,I stay here all the time unless I'm over at the Delano or Mandalay Bay multiple times a year for about a week long stay each time.This place always has friendly staff and great entertainment. I went and saw the AGT live show this time around and it was fantastic. The theater seats were very comfortable and the space completely emerges the audience in to the show with great sound and lighting effects.    The late night food court is pretty good when you need som food and don't want to go far. There starbucks is open 24 hours Friday and Saturday here and at excalibur.    Travel to Mandalay and Excalibur are very easy and lots of stuff to see do or buy.    Overall Luxor gives you the best of both worlds and falls right in the middle so you get a higher end experience like the Mandalay would give but closer to a price that Excalibur would offer.
50,The staff was the best staff I have ever encountered at a Las Vegas resort. The room was nice and clean and it smelled amazing like I was right at home! The staff was supper nice in accommodating with a wheelchair accessible room although I booked a regular room due to the availability online.
50,The inclinators in the hotel cause minor confusion the rest of the hotel is full of wonderful events inside and adjacent to everything else you’d want to experience such as the strip (just walk through the Excalibur hotel) or any of the events in neighboring hotels
30,Room was just ok. Dated but newish decor. Bed was so low and awkward. They charge an additional 50 deposit per night on top of resort fees. Escalators and walking ramps were intermittently broken through my 4 day stay.
40,Very clean and room was the king suite and it was very nice and beautiful. The bed was comfy the services were good and check in wasn’t bad they helped us out pretty quick and casino was fairly clean and pool was nice just not much room it would get packed
50,Very enjoyable stay at the luxor staff was friendly. Hotel room was clean everything was easily and readily accessible. Food was pretty good. I did not have a hard time checking in or out at all. Overall great stay.
50,Luxor was Impressive we had not been back to Vegas in over 15 years and were excited to return & it did not disappoint. We visited other hotels in the area and enjoyed the easy access from one to another
50,Awesome it was met with a great staff and made me feel very comfortable. Made tge experience worth the while during my stay and hope to see ya again in 24 when the open comes back to vegas    Thanks all
50,The staff is always very friendly and anxious to help. The location allows you to visit other casinos without dealing with the inclement weather and rowdy crowds. The food at the Deli Tender and sports bar fantastic but huge.
20,Everyone working at the Luxor was incredible from the cleaning staff to the front desk to security the casino and the restaurants. Unfortunately our room especially the bathroom was in rough shape. You also had to rent a mini fridge if you wanted one which is absolutely ridiculous for how much you're already spending on your room. Despite the rooms being smoke-free people smoke in their rooms and the smell comes out into the hallways and it will probably permeate into yours as well. Probably will not stay here again unless they make some big changes.
40,Stay was average room smelled like smoke and water pressure sucked and water temperature was bad...also my last day the air conditioning was not working properly. Staff was fine and gambling tables were awesome
50,One of the best I would always stay there it’s very clean and it’s in a great location close to everything and the food is good plus it’s kid friendly just a all around great place to stay I would recommend it to everyone
50,I have stayed at this hotel twice and both times have been exceptional. East access to other hotels. Staff is friendly and helpful. The variety of places to eat is affordable. The pool area is fantastic and I highly recommend it to anyone staying in Vegas.
50,Friendly staff and clean rooms wins me over. Not to mention that I had a super fast and early check in with no hassle!  Love that this hotel is close all the areas I love to visit and shop around love the luxor food shops as well.
50,Had the best sleep ever in a Vegas hotel. Would stay here again.    Staff was friendly. The pyramid cafe was our go to for early morning breakfast. They had great service and food. No complaints from us!
10,Filthy rooms not vacuumed dirty socks left on the floor smelled like someone had just smoked pot in the room homeless guy sleeping outside our window with a 12 pack of beer staff didn’t seem to care at all. 2nd room had poop on the toilet seat again the staff didn’t really seem to care. Finally got ahold of a manager who moved us to our 3rd room which was ok. Hotel is old outdated and half the stuff there is broken. Spend your money elsewhere we will never go back to Luxor
10,Found bug in room after back and forth calls and in-person complaints FINALLY got room changed. It was 4 IN THE MORNING… Then the new room was dirty with hair and stickers all over the shower and the shower door was broken.. every shower FLOODED the bathroom floor wtf??!
50,Want a cool hotel with the best rooms the Luxor is the place for you. It’s easy to navigate has food court that’s close and the tram is the easiest and fastest one to get to in any hotel. Check out takes 1 minute tops.
40,I specifically stayed here for evo. Overall a solid hotel room that's not too far from the venue which makes it easy to go back and forth. It lacks an ethernet port however also there's no fridge (the mandalay has one but it charges you an arm and a leg to even use it so it basically doesn't have one). The shower is fairly short I'm 5'8 maybe 5'9 so I was fine but taller folks will definitely have a pretty awkward situation with the shower. Also AC being away from the bed kinda sucks compared to mandalay which has the AC right next to your bed. Overall though solid room easy to get to the venue bed was comfy etc. I recommend if you want a cheaper stay but wanna be near evo venue!!
50,The Tower Rooms are extraordinary! The gaming floor always has a huge selection and new slot machines. The waitresses are plentiful and the hosts are super friendly and accommodating. I love the food selections as well. Diablos (Best Tex Mex I've ever had) The Pyramid Cafe for brunch is never dissapointing and the biggest buffet I've ever seen!
40,Clean room with comfy beds. Easy to get around to other hotels and it was close to the stadium for concerts. Love the theme and look of this hotel but we were stuck on the third floor so the outside traffic noise and housekeeping radio kept us awake at times
50,If you are looking for a luxury stay for an affordable price stay at the Luxor! Everything is great from the rooms food pool guest services etc. There are many ways to access the strip from here as well.
50,Good location with access to free tram between NYNY and Excalibur. Easy access to the paid monorail that provides access to most of the strip. Clean rooms and friendly staff. The pool was nice as well.
10,The luxor was not what I thought it was I had to check out early because of the service I was not pleased at all they didn't honor none of their promises and they did nothing to try and fix or make things right
50,My son’s birthday and we had a very good time we were able to get a late check which the front desk was nice and helpful we also had a fun day on a day tour everyone was very helpful to our need’s yes
50,Fast check in. Affordable rooms. Friendly staff. Good food 24/7. Loose slots. And the place is visually cool. There pool is a good size and very clean. You can walk to the Mandalay Bay or Excalibur hotels via enclosed shop filled tunnels so no going outside. It’s awesome Thanks Luxor .
40,Location was at the end of the strip which was actually perfect and provided an absolutely amazing view of the mountains. It was also connected to both hotels on either side which made it very convenient to travel without having to endure the heat.
20,Our room in the pyramid section of the hotel felt tired and shabby. Worn out electrical outlets no outlets on the nightstand gaps around the fire sprinklers and no hot water for a shower on half the occasions we tried. When we were able to get hot water there is no door (by design) on the shower that always left the bathroom floor wet. Not good for seniors.
50,I was a bit hesitant on we my colleague told me that the Lux was getting bad reviews but my experience was great. Customer service was great. My room was clean. There were restaurants to eat from at the hotel.
10,Will never stay again worst experience in Vegas I have ever had room was disgusting table dealers were all awful and stuck up only positive was that the housekeeping was friendly other then that never will return
10,Plumbing in room was terrible took a long time for it to be fixed hotel cost to much to have any issues and it took me talking to a manager two times to get fixed very unacceptable not sure if I will stay again
50,Great benefits and prices for Veterans & members of Royal Caribbean Crown & Anchor members. I was surprised with how little we paid for two double queen rooms on a Sunday. The MGM Rewards window took their time to be helpful in making sure I received all the benefits I was qualified to receive.
40,Good stay great price clean spacious room. Staff was friendly and nice. Check in was quick when I arrived at around 4:30 pm. Wished room came with mini fridge I didn’t request one so not sure if they’re offered but overall was a good stay
50,We could stay at any MGM property. The reason we choose to stay at the luxor is the people and the treatment. From Jocelyn who checks us in to Sue our casino host to all the pit bosses..... They all are friendly always have smile on their faces they make us laugh. We even have some preferred dealers that make it fun no matter if we win or lose. The other properties we have stayed at have been the Aria and the MGM and I must say being ignored Entreated poorly seems to be the norm because we have stayed there several times due to Luxor being full and every time we wish we were at the Luxor.
50,Enjoyed are stay at the Luxor.  Room was clean and comfortable.  Especially since we had a pet friendly room.  Most times pet friendly rooms are not quite as nice.  Checking in was easier with self check in.
50,The room was big the staff was incredible. I found that noise didn’t carry from room to room. Pool was awesome love the little islands. Pyramid theme is perfect. I highly recommend a stay. We ate at public house highly recommend the poke nachos!
40,The value was okay. They need to at least offer complimentary water or coffee. The daily maid service was good. We did enjoy our stay. One thing we didn’t like was we weren’t able to go to our friends floor since they were on a different floor then us. That was not convenient
10,Since check in the experience was ghetto and not what I expected. See my review notes for more details. Unprofessionalism let another family check into our room treated us like criminals and made me miss my sons championship
40,Loved the shower the views and the staff is kind. We stayed for 8 nights and had a good time! I appreciate the tram and the  Easy access to Mandalay Bay. Good hotel for resting. I don’t gamble so the shows were my favorite part of the trip.
50,Large rooms great entertainment clean lots of food options connected to Mandalay Bay. Customer service is always on point. They have an incredible mobile check/out option including a digital key which adds a level of safety as you have to scan to access your room floor.
50,Great family trip. WE got to visit family friendly places. Great food. Area 15 was phenomenal. Titanic exhibit is one of our favorite experiences in Las Vegas. We could have spent another week just exploring all the great things at the luxor and it's surrounding places.
50,Loved my stay here. Easy to get to the airport. Everyone was polite and courteous. I ate at Tender and the chimichurri sauce on the filet was delicious. I would definitely stay here again and again and again.
50,I absolutely love the Luxor it was very clean nice and smelled great I hate I had to leave. Hotep I also love the view from my room loved the food downstairs at the cafe the people was friendly nice .
50,Staff was friendly pool was great room was clean. Hotel is on the south side of the strip so it is a little quieter which is nice but you do have a 30 minute walk to get to the busier part of the strip. Would definitely stay here again.
50,I loved my stay and would love to come back again soon! The food is pricey but it was delicious! The hotel was really huge! It took us a day to actually tour the whole hotel! I loved the pool area it was also huge and beautiful! It has shopping centers in there and lots of restaurants!
50,The house keepers were amazing in cleaning the rooms the room AC need it to be more cool it was not cooling at all the kids loved the hotel they had lots of fun exploring the hotel the pool was amazing
30,We have stayed at the Luxor many times over the years. We love it for its unique architecture and obvious Egyptian decorations. While the rooms have had their furnishings and finishes updated the mechanical systems don’t appear to have been changed out. There was a bad water leak in our ceiling that ran into the closet cabinet. We notified housekeeping but nothing was done over our stay.
10,My worst vegas experience thus far! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
30,This was my only opportunity for vacation with the family an we chose this hotel. 4 days and 3 nights. We can't sleep at all because the room was next to the ice and vending machines  loud noise all nights it was a nightmare.
50,Girls trip had so much fun! Everyone we met were so very nice! We did not want for a thing! We did everything & more! Will never forget this vacation!!! 🥰 loved Fremont street!! Luxor was the best!! The pool was beautiful went down every morning!!
30,Slightly dated Hotel which was quite dark. The room we had was large but as is normal in some LA hotels didn’t have fridge etc. Bathroom was clean and beds made up each day. Sadly only one pool open so was very crowded and noisy. Disappointing.
20,Internet was bad bathroom door wouldn’t close. Bait and switch on our room self parking was expensive and we were told by different staff members to go to different locations to pick up an Uber. Not going to stay there again
10,The room was dark. It was not well lit at all. The elevator ride was scary. It is like riding a roller coaster standing up. As a heart patient I wish I would have been warned about that experience. The room smelled like smoke even though smoking isn't allowed. The room seemed damp and smelly. I left after one night and was supposed to stay two. I wish I had booked a different hotel for my mother and I. This was horrible. DO NOT BOOK THE LUXOR!
50,I’ve stayed there every trip to Las Vegas since 2018 Annually I’m comfortable there and staff is great. I’ve stayed there pushing 30 nights now. I also  Tell friends and family about the Luxor. Staff is always great
30,Ok so I had a good experience but my friends who also stayed had wildly different and somewhat negative experiences. Overall it’s hard to judge because the staff/ hotel were inconsistent as far as service.
50,I have been to luxor a couple of times and it has not failed me at allservice is great. The customer service experience is like no other..I was there a couple of hours early an I was able to get a room although I was there a couple of hours later..
50,We were very happy with our Luxor stay. Room very clean and comfortable staff extremely pleasant good variety of games as well as good food choices. Location was great with easy access to where we wanted to go.
10,It seems that the reviews were quite good but maybe things have changed over here first day and no one near 6pm has clean the room!!! called already 2 times and no news from anyone we still have 9 days to to we will update here since it seems calling services is of no use.
40,This was my first time staying at the Luxor and it was worth the money. One of the very few hotels with a buffet still which was great. The was easy to get to the other hotels as well which was nice .
50,Great staff and room was awesome!! Luxor staff was fantastic! Check in was quick and effortless. The dining facilities were so great. Loved the pool and our cabana day was an amazing experience it’s a must!
40,The casino and hotel is very clean priced fairly and has a large selection of gaming options. There’s an indoor walkway to Mandalay and Excalibur which is a nice way to avoid some of the summer heat. The pool is huge and very well maintained plenty of free lounge chairs.
10,Buggy room and rude staff! This was definitely not a hotel experience to love or like. I wish that the staff would’ve been more considerate in addressing the issues that were brought to the table. Bugs are never a good sight.
50,Room was clean but the only thing I didn’t like is that there was no fridge and since my mom needs it to store her medication made it kinda of hard to keep getting ice and also the fact that we had to pay for parking while staying at the hotels kinda killed it for me !!! Other then that I like staying there !
10,I’m not very happy with the service or quality of it and no one was helping us at all with anything check out or check in was rude and didn’t give us any type of information that we require that we needed.
20,I will not stay here again. The building is cool but the room was not clean at all and lacked the basic amenities. The location is convenient for travel to the airport but very isolated from activity on the strip.
20,Early checkin is a scam at this property. Room had a clogged sink that no one fixed  People at the front desk promised a room between 11-1 if we paid for early checkin we paid for it and didn’t get our room until 3 never got a refund. Plus tons of charges on my account with no explanation
50,The property is perfect for its price and location on the strip. Will always be a destination of mine. The room was clean and the staff are extremely friendly. The casino floor is not overly crowded or smoky.
10,Left behind some value stuff in the slot machine I was using went to the restroom for like 2 minutes my items where stolen when I went to Security to pull up camaras to see who had taken my property they said we don’t do that here just fill up this paper with your name and number screw you luxor
10,This property was dirty and h cleaned guest rooms. If you stay on floor 18 and your walking to your room. You will see and smell mold. The staff is rude and doesn’t handle your concerns. I only had two staff members that even seemed like they were happy to have a job as well as to take care of the guest. I wouldn’t pay the price for this hotel… there are many more properties on the strip that are nice with nice employees.
30,There was sticky stuff on the bathroom floor when we first arrived. There was also a bad odor in the room and the toilet splashed up onto the seat every time it was flushed. This was not resolved prior to check out
50,The Luxor is an older casino - it's not the Bellagio/Wynn/Venetian/Aria. But the value is awesome and some of the shows are better than what can be found at the high end resorts. Namely Fantasy - my 2nd time seeing it and I'm sure there will be a 3rd!
50,Hidden Gem! Very laid back and relaxing hotel and pool. The rooms are very quiet for Vegas. Hotel staff is very helpful and the checkin and checkout procedures are all digital if you prefer no contact. Great location and excellent pool self parking etc.
10,We went to celebrate our engagement and thinking of going back for our wedding (not going to happen). There are 4 pools but during our stay only 1 was open due to “maintenance” and that pool was filled with so many people and kids and it stunk. I don't know how this hotel is a 4 star hotel. We had a premium room in the tower. The room was dusty found hair on the towels the AC did not keep the room very cold. There is NO coffee maker you have to walk forever to get to closest starbucks ( 19.00) for two venti specialty coffees. No fridge in the rooms so we could not even get some food to keep in the room. Now lets talk about the resort fees we checked and we pay resort fees for the use of the gym  wfi  and phone they say they have these fabulous pools well we were there 5 days and not one day was all the pools open so if you did not get up as soon as the pool opened you did not get a chair at the one pool that was open. We had to call the front desk twice to ask a question and each staff member that answered the call was so rude not a nice way to treat guests at your hotel. The cost of the food is so expense we went to the deli and for two sandwiches and two order of fries and 1 pop was almost 50.00 US dollars for sandwiches so ridiculous .We got tickets for America's got talent and my partner got us front row seats as he knew it is my favorite show. The whole time there was camera man standing right in front of us so that was a waist of money so disappointed. We came from Canada and spend way to much money for such a bad experience  if you are going to Las Vegas there was so many better choices for hotels and not at the end of the strip. I know a big hotel like that will not care about our thoughts but I wanted to share with others before you decide to stay there.
50,Customer service and the staff members was excellent. The front desk staff was very kind and helpful the Mexican restaurant staff was very nice the steak restaurant was excellent and the Cafe forgot the name of the place that was also nice
10,The place is dirty  dark  rooms n hallways smell like mold/ cigarettes rooms. 1 bedroom suite does not look like pictures as advertised. I’ll never stay here again. Only cosmopolitan or Bellagio . I should have known because it was a comp . But I even paid $200 for a upgrade
50,I have stayed at Luxor before when single with friends and enjoyed it. So I decided to stay again for a week & half with my kids. Front desk and housekeeping were very nice & helpful. Food was good. Had a great time. I really enjoyed staying there. My kids loved the room big and spacious.
40,Room and service was great! Buffet left a bit to be desired as it is only open for breakfast and lunch no longer offer all day bands. Limited waitress on floor. Pay outs were extremely slim.. Go for the atmoshere not to gamble.
50,Very clean Quick check in and out very smooth. Rooms I was suppost to stay at was not ready and was given a upgrade for free. Good Location with easy tram and walk ways exsess. Food court makes it easy to find something to eat.
50,Fantastic place to stay! We loved being able to check in through the app and use the digital key right through our app on our phone. It made checking in so easy! We also loved how easy it was to go from Luxor to Excalibur and Mandalay Bay. The room was spacious and clean. Highly recommend staying at the Luxor! We will definitely be back.
50,The Luxor was amazing the gambling was incredible free bet blackjack was super cool waitresses service was amazing great dealers really just an overall amazing 4 days we had. Our other friends stayed at mgm and linq but every night we all ended up back at Luxor finishing off the night! Will definitely be staying here again when the bankroll permits!
50,Excellent hotel. The front desk was very helpful and allowed me to check in earlier with no problem. Great hotel for an excellent price. This was a family vacation and the hotel offers alot of things for everyone to enjoy.
50,Amazing resort for a very reasonable price! It have everything I wanted and more for my 3 night stay and in fact offers so much I couldn't experience it all before it was time to leave. I had services at the salon and they were incredible making my special night even more special. I will definitely be back the next time I'm in town!
50,I had a wonderful big suite.  This suite was so big. It was almost big as my New York Apartment. LOL  My visit was wonderful I planned to come back there again in April.  The service at front desk was excellent and everyone was so nice friendly and I really enjoy myself.
50,Excellent stay. Gambled ate drank and enjoyed our stay immensely! Staff was courteous and helpful. Accommodations were clean and nice. Location was convenient and taxi/Uber/limo service was easily available.
40,Luxor Hotel gives me good promotions so I try to take advantage of them. If you want a fast check in download the MGM App that explains how to check in yourself. You'll save so much time doing this. The premier room on the East 15th floor was bigger than a standard room. The only complaint I had was the bathroom floor had these black grimey spots in some areas. A good place to eat breakfast or lunch is at the Pyramid Cafe. The food and customer service was excellent. The room service is now allowed to use. The housekeeping was nice to make up our beds and clean the room everyday. I overall give Luxor a 4 . It was very good stay.
50,We appreciated being able to bring our dog with us on this trip! We had easy access to the elevators and let areas. Hotel staff was super helpful with additional things we needed like a rollaway bed and mini fridge. Our room was clean and comfortable.
50,Wonderful!! Can’t wait to come back. Everything was so convenient. I have difficulty walking and explanation getting to the correct elevators could have been better. That was my only complaint concerning my stay
50,Exceptional loved every minute of our stay and we will be back!!! Hotel and all areas were very clean and well taken care or!! Every employee that we encountered were exceptionally helpful and professional
50,The stay was great. Be careful though the bathroom floor becomes very slick when wet.  The room doesn't have a fridge microwave or coffee maker.  It's exciting to be at Luxor. Great food & gambling.  It's scary to look down 7 floors into the lobby....  Great time excellent and fun ! !!!!!!!!!
50,Everything was great good buffet  great workercasino is kinda of pricey but outside the casino is still up there but more reasonable walked the strip at night its like a whole different world really nice time.
40,check in was easy the room were nice we had a great time at the pool the view inside the hotel was great the restaurants were good the hotel had everything you needed so you didn’t have to leave i would definitely stay at the luxor again
50,Luxor always the best. suite was awesome casino energetic you can see and hear winners around the clock Hospitality A+. My casino (Sally Rodriguez) host always goes above and beyond making sure our stay is always the best.
40,Enjoyed the pool and the room was great the staff was friendly and very helpful. The kids enjoyed  the buffet and the food court. I enjoyed the gambling and the drinks. Would definitely stay here again really enjoyed the stay
40,The front desk was awesome went out of their way to help me with my digital key and walked med to the appropriate elevator especially since we were delayed 2 hours and it was 2am. The room was very comfortable quiet and clean! 😎🤙🏾
50,Casino was boring but I was treated great by the staff. The room was comfortable. The pool was nice and clean. I go forgot my charger and they helped me with another one. Mobile check in was easy and I don't understand why others don't use it.
50,Loved everything about my room a nice view of the city and the lights hotel was clean staff was nice definitely will be back. I enjoy playing on the roulette table along with the slot machines the food was great a little pricey in the cafeteria not worth the prices.
50,Had a nice time there. I always wanted to stay there. The buffet was decent just wish it was open a little later than 3pm. It was a pretty cool sensation riding an elevator that travels sideways instead of just up and down!
50,We love the Luxor. This time we stayed in a 2-bedroom suite in the West Tower. Everything was great! It was July and it’s HOT in Vegas so the AC struggled to keep up in the main bedroom. We kept the curtains closed to keep the sun out as much as possible. I wish the Luxor would have more lighting in the rooms. The rooms are very dark especially in the corners where the dresser is making it difficult to get dressed.  But those are minor annoyances. The service at the Luxor is great. We love staying between Mandalay Bay and Excalibur/NYNY so it’s easy to travel between casinos. Lots of dining options - our favorite is Diablos and the Pyramid Cafe has delicious breakfast and lunch options.  We enjoy the pool area and always get great service at the spa.  Stop by the bar right next to the mgm rewards counters. Bartenders are friendly and give great service there.
50,Tower Room was clean and nice size. Diablo’s Cantina had excellent service and food. Casino area had nice variety of table games and slots. Blue Man Group show was highly entertaining (fourth time I’ve seen it)
40,My room was very comfy and a good value. The bed was very soft and there was rain shower head in the shower. Check in and out was easy through the MGM app and I also liked the pool. The only reason I am not giving five stars have to do with the elevators. They clearly needed some work and they looked worn. The key card reader was also hard to use. Definitely a good place to stay for an introduction to Vegas.
30,Rooms could have been cleaner. Valet was backed up on Friday . Waited almost 1 hour. Called house keeping for fresh towels they were delivered the next day. This was my second time visiting the Luxor and I was not impressed this last stay .
40,Easy check in with mobile app. Room was very comfortable but disappointed they don't provide a mini fridge. They charge for a refrigerator but have a space for it (like they purposely remove them). Overall nice hotel.
10,Why I have extra charges for no reason. Need someone to answer customer service call. We stayed and paid from third party and then paid taxes and resort fees. Why you charge and extra 400 dollar. Need to call me back
20,The room was dusty and it looked like the mini fridge was ripped out of the cabinet. Once the cleaning crew came the room was a lot better. Windows were dirty but that did not affect our stay at the Luxor.
50,Always a Great experience here. My wife and I have been coming to this hotel the last 10 years. They have a great Egyptian theme that we really love. If there's anything ever wrong they are fast and very professional at resolving the issue.
50,I have stayed at the Luxor for 90 % of my LV stays. I love the hotel the staff is friendly and it is clean. The hotel is also cost-friendly ;) I have enjoyed my experience every time I have stayed at the Luxor! The Bodies and Titanic exhibits are amazing!
50,Great vacation. The room spacious and the Hotel and Casino was extremely clean. We attended the Blue Man Group and Americas Got Talent shows . Both were excellent and right there at the hotel. Will be visiting again soon.
50,Luxor Las Vegas never disappoints. Second time I get to Vegas and choose Luxor to stay. Love the place the environment the luxury. Loved that this time I didn’t have to make the long line to check in. MGM has managed to allow clients to check in thru their app. Just one observation: the hotel is quite old and needs some improvements. The fixtures of my room were too old and the waste of water is unnecessary and painful.
30,The Luxor has still its shine and good rooms. Of course you are expected to gamble and play.  But Attention: the pool area has no shade ready for you. I mean only if you pay for it. A daybed is 150$ and a cabana 300$! No problem of course when you won the day before. One cabana out of ten was rented. The rest of the crowd tried to hide under their towels and in the pool. What a ridiculous pity. I won’t go there again. Sorry. Else: you get hast you can expect. The rooms in the tower are newer than the ones in the pyramid.
50,I had a great time I come all the time with my dad but my mom has never been so I decided to take her we had a blast we shopped and ate good food gambled the slots seem to really like me and I moved up to the highest card in one night so that was cool
50,Room was super clean and spacious!! I was recovering from surgery and this room was perfect! Super huge and very clean with a very nice view of the strip! I particularly enjoyed being close to the vending area and the elevators!!! 10 out of 10
40,Luxor is a good location. Connects you to mandalay for which in between luxor to there has so many great shops to stop at and eat. Public house has good food for those that may need something filling before the parties or the Day after. Pool is a nice place to relax. I recommend you stay in their tower rooms at the Luxor if you’re there to relax poolside spa or use the gym often as it is feets away from their elevators.    As soon as you come out from the tower rooms to the main casino area there is a Starbucks there. Join their membership program too as you get a lot of perks like comped rooms. You can go to their website and see what are the more affordable days to stay as well. At times your comped room will come with a casino credit as well as a food and beverage credit that works at multiple locations in the strip. A list of those can be found on the MGM website.    The one downside and reason I removed a star is that they don’t have a place to eat at 24/7. Everything late night is a Uber trip required or you’ll need to walk. If they could add a fast food place that’s 24/7 in the luxor it would make the experience feel much better.    I know many people like staying at the Luxor cause it’s affordable and near so many cool places…..but it be nice that when you get back late night to know there’s a late night food option.
50,Fun and lots of attractions very hotWe like Ra Ra and the casino in Luxor Did not go to buffet but went to Resorts World and had great Thai food Thereis a lot of traffic and the heat makes it worse but there is lots of air conditioner
50,Great Casino! Won big!! Food and service pool was great!!Definitely worth it and will come again soon.  Room was great and quiet as well. Check in was fast and parking was easy as well. Was very happy with the stay!
40,Service is always excellent at the front desk. Rooms are clean and well kept. Really enjoyed our stay . Very convenient with booking shows and redeeming our comp points always have a great time.  Only issue was no table in our room
50,Mgm resorts specially Luxor hotel is the best choice when you want to visit Las Vegas. From breakfast to dinner the casino the buffet the pool the rooms the shows even the construction of the building is amazing!
50,I've come to Vegas for the last 3 years and have fallen in love with staying at the Luxor. I've never been disappointed with the rooms or the customer service so to be truly honest this is the only hotel I book when I do my yearly visit to sin city love me some Luxor and Vegas.
50,Very clean room! Updated too! Friendly desk staff! Amazing price. Highly reccomend! Pool was amazing. Need to show your key card for access. I went for business but I'd totally go back for pleasure. Well worth it.
20,This was our third time staying at the Luxor & normally is a very pleasant stay. However this time the check-in and -out was slow and we had trouble finding assistance. In the morning there was something wrong with our water pressure; it spit and sputtered and would not heat as a result we were unable to shower.
50,As always a superb experience.  Sally Rodriguez is a wonderful host and saw to our every need.  I’ve been going to Luxor since it opened and have never been disappointed.  I highly recommend the Luxor to anyone!
50,Came for our son's 21st birthday. Everyone had a great time! Great rooms the pool was amazing!!! The staff was super friendly and helpful. Got a cabana 100% would recommend! Excellent experience for a 21 year old AND his entourage.
50,Had a great time with family. Staff was great. Very attentive to our needs. Really like the new rewars program. Seems to be easier to understand. For sure we will make more visits frequently and enjoy vegas.
40,This isn't the newest or nicest property on the Strip but it's still a pretty decent resort. I stayed in a pyramid room which was clean and nicely appointed. Since the rooms face the atrium there is a little sound that gets in but it wasn't anything too bad.    The amenities are on par with other Strip resorts and service was very pleasant. The main drawback is location--although it's right next door to Mandalay Bay and Excalibur it would be quite a walk to get to Caesars or Bellagio.    If you're not super concerned about location this is a really good value for Las Vegas.
10,our room tv was not working at all for kids to enjoy movies while wife and i celebrated anniversary. We contacted the service staff to get issue resolved and nothing was ever fixed. we had 2 technicians come out with the latest one coming around 11pm. At this point the events my wife and i were already ruined.
20,For the price I think you can do better. Spend not much more and stay at the Four Seasons. The rooms felt old and smelled. No amenities to speak of. To find coffee in the morning we were subjugated to standing in one of the numerous Starbuck's lines. Restaurants food not equal to the cost. Not recommended.
10,Employees at the check in counter are rude and instead of trouble shooting the issue they make you stand in line again to deal with a different check in person. The rooms were outdated. The vanity mirror was broken in one room and the shower was broken in another room.
10,The Luxor is a Horrible rundown disgusting Old hotel which is not kept up well. The staff was amazingly wonderful and helpful but would NEVER stay here again. Only 4 video poker machines in the entire casino.
40,Enjoyed our stay. Very clean and staff was great. The rooms could use some upgrading but all in all not that bad. Pool was great. Wish this casino was more in the middle of the strip. Long walks to go down the strip.
50,Beautiful casino. Lots to do. You don’t even have to leave the hotel for anything they have all the entertainment you need. Great breakfast at the diner. Huge pool too bad it was raining when we where there.
40,Brought our daughter here for a last minute getaway before her senior year of school started. Very affordable. Great location. Staff is very accommodating and helpful. Offers a fun atmosphere that you can relax in. Conveniently connected to both Mandalay Bay and Excalibur which made exploring fun.
30,All the mgm resorts look identical except for price. My last trip was 12 years ago and the casinos had more individuality now they are all the same inside and knowing that covid is still around there didn't seem to be ANY precautions only lack of tables to play on that weren't 5 deep
40,Rooms are okay .. some parts of the common areas appears to be renovated … staff is great!!! Vending machines didn’t appear to work on floor had to go all the way down to store on Casino level for snacks / drinks.
10,"Before this stay I have never stayed at the Luxor and wanted to experience in the pyramid. I made my reservation online with no problems however when i arrived that was not the case. My reservation was for 2 queen beds which for some reason showed 1 king in the system. Also the rate that was shown online that I prepaid for did not include the resort fees. When I book online though Caesars it is all included so I know what the total cost is. Front reception finally made it right after 45 mins. I paid the added fees and was told I was given an ""upgrade"" with 2 queen beds. Once i arrived to my room the reception to the TV was horrible quality and found no mini fridge/coffee machine. I usually stay at Caesers Resorts which this is standard. While getting ready for bed to my disgust I found a large which appeared at first to be a feather but later turned out to be a womans fake eye lash on top of my sheets. It was very late and instead of complaining at that time I just removed the top sheet. I also noticed that the AC would push in a filtered smoke/cigarette smell. Then at 8 am I was awoken by the maid making entry into my room. I was unhappy with my stay especially after being told this was an ""upgrade"". I would not recomend family and friends to stay at the Luxor."
10,I promise you you'll be extremely frustrated with this hotel. Spend the extra cash and stay somewhere else. This hotel was the only bad part of my trip. They make you pay for a mini fridge they double charged my card the elevator seems like it's going to break down on you every time the views are worse than a motel 6 and no one picks up the phone. So don't count on any type of room service
40,To trip down to flamingo area that place was trashed bath rooms filthy  Old and run down. Made me feel happy I stayed on the Luxor side of the strip would like to see more restaurants options in the Luxor instead of the over priced fast food. Could eat a regular priced meal for what they charge
50,I wanted a memorable trip for my birthday this year and I chose Las Vegas. This was my first time visiting Las Vegas and I heard great reviews about The Luxor Hotel and I wasn't disappointed. Thank you.
10,Advertised to have multiple pools yet only one very overcrowded pool was open during our stay. Apparently this is norm during weekdays according to staff when I asked. Brought my 7 nieces and nephews and they were all bummed. Resort fee not half during weekdays.
30,When I arrived to my room I tried to get comfortable from a difficult check inn. After getting comfortable I started to notice red stains on the walls and ceiling. Stains on bed sheets and pillows of furniture. Tube didn’t even looked like it was clean. There was a black stain on the ceiling above the tube. I felt discouraged to continue my stay. I called the front desk to tell them I was checking out because of how the room was left.
10,Honestly it was far below what I would have expected. When we get there we are given a room right away which this is the only reason I am giving it any stars. We get to our room and the mirrors are dirty the room smells of musty smoke there is food chunks on the floor and the lights were oily which then made me check the bed. There was HAIR in the bed. Tiny small curly hairs between the sheets. So I call and they move us. Room seemed cleaner until I was standing at the bed side putting makeup on in the mirror and noticed a BOOGER plastered to the head board. I called and explained and they said they would send someone up. They didn’t. It was there the whole trip. And my husband and I slept as far on the other side of the king as possible. Then had my socks and shoes off a the floor felt crusty in one spot. Then we go to the pool the second day we are there and one part of the pool closes due to a biohazard. This part is closed for two hours and in that time no one took the liberty to clean the pool or the obvious green film and two empty cups floating in one corner of the pool. I’m truly disgusted. At this point I am so dissatisfied with my stay and it was my husbands first time and mine second and this left a sour taste for all MGM hotels.
10,For the price of the room the quality was terrible. There was no fridge no water no soap in the bathroom the bathroom was dirty with other people leftovers. Also I had to wait more than 1 hour for get the room key
50,Super easy uncomplicated stay. Friendly check in and fast check out. The Starbucks was pleasant and service was great. Sadly not too many cocktail waitresses but the bars were staffed and courteous. Had a nice time.
20,It’s a spectacular building from the exterior.  Pool area and the casino are typical of Las Vegas hotels.  Where it looses points is once you get off the elevator the hallway is very musty. Then the room had an odor of badly cooked cabbage.  Very disappointing for a cool looking hotel.  Hopefully they’ll try to do something about it.
40,I don’t really understand half these negative reviews. If you stay in a tower room it’s clean low cost spacious rooms etc. Room service works I genuinely don’t understand how there are bad reviews. Are people expecting a 5 star room experience for $80 a day? I was legitimately concerned going into the hotel because of some reviews but it’s perfectly fine. You can check in on your phone to be able to just go straight to your room which will be made ready. You can print a physical room key later on. My only problems were the horrible wifi and needing your roomkey to use the elevator which only lets you go to 3 floors but honestly if you’re on vacation you shouldn’t even need wifi that badly.
40,We really enjoyed our stay Luxor is our go to casino. Great value and we love the unique theme. Would be nice if the hallways were refreshed some. They smell stale. Everything else was great. We will be back.
30,Elevators in area 3 where we were staying were very temperamental and breaking down during our stay Hotel is starting to look her age and a little worn out Ive stayed here many times with my children but don't know of ill return again. The hotel could have used the last two years of the lock downs to freshen up a bit
50,Everyone was friendly and helpful from valet parking upon arrival to front desk bar and restaurant and casino staff. Room was very nice comfortable and clean. Will stay at Luxor again when in Las Vegas. We met family there who reserved two rooms. They echo my remarks as well.
50,Love traveling with the family is always something to do excellent shows love the blue man recommended 💯fast room cleaning is always food love the selection of the slot machines always a god experience.
30,First of all you should know that this is hotel is from the cheapest end of scale in the strip. That should already tell you a lot about the hotel. We had tower queen room which I shared with my workmate. The room is large enough for two for sure. We had a nice view to the airport. The housekeeping is by far the best thing in this hotel. They took really good care of our (quite dated) room.    The pool area cannot be compared to other hotels on the strip.    Buffet was open only wed-sun 08am-3pm. And everything is well overpriced in the small quick restaurants and markets but hey that’s Vegas and that should not be a surprise.    Gym was nice and I was able to do my daily exercise very easily.    The Mexican restaurant on the second level was good and service was also very good.    All in all I would not book this hotel but this time it was not my choice to make.
10,No deep cleaning    Too many dust when I cough ………………..……………..;…………………………………………………….…………………………………..
30,The room was very humid the floor in the bathroom was sticky and dirty the a/c was not cooling down and the bathtub had red streaks in it. It was very frustrated… I always tell people “I always stay at Luxor” but the last 2 times I’ve been there the rooms have been very dirty.
50,Check In Check Out the Front Desk the Bell Desk and MGM Rewards were all very helpful knowledgeable friendly and efficient. This was my first time in Las Vegas and I was there visiting family. The excellent location and service contributed to my being able to make the most of a short trip (i.e. three days and two nights). I was especially glad that the comedian Carrot Top 🥕 was performing at the Luxor where I was staying because that made it easy to get tickets and enjoy the show with family. Therefore I would recommend the Luxor to anyone looking for a topnotch experience. Bravo. 👏
30,It was an average at best hotel not bad not great. The food court selection fair. The pool was decent just both pools were not open to allow options and the exercise gym could use some updated equipment.
50,You cannot fault this hotel. For the price point it is a great place to stay and play. Connected to Excalibur and mandalay bay. Great restaurants and great casino. Love the backstage deli and public house for food. Staff extremely helpful.
50,From the time we got there (super late) until we checked out 5 days later every staff member we had an interaction with was super polite had a great sense of humor and willing to assist us with whatever we needed.
50,Rooms were clean. Staff was helpful. Very nice stay. Casino was clean and gaming was fun. I recomend this hotel for an economical stay. Using an Uber saved tones of time and money traveling around and to airport.
20,Dirty room with stained linens and towels. Sink took hours to drain. Room is very outdated. I’m pretty sure nothing has changed since 1999. We wanted to stay in the pyramid but wish we had chosen another MGM property.
40,Our stay at Luxor was very good. The rooms were comfortable and clean and the casino affordable. Only real con was the front desk wasn't accessible by phone... We had to go downstairs and stand inline.
10,The rooms hallways and all the walkways in the casino smell like old carpet. This resort needs to be updated badly. The TV is even old fashioned. The staff was mostly pretty rude. Just not a classy place on any level.
40,Very nice hotel with plenty of food options friendly staffquick checkin generous comps and slot play when playing with card and tram to and from 2 other casinos very convenient and the sky bridges makes everything convenient in seeing other casinos
30,Only reason I can’t give it a 5 is because the the pool area had a bad lingering smell. And it’s July/August and the pool area is very popular and only one was open. And it got crowded at one point. It was very uncomfortable.
40,Great place to stay. The only negative old girl is starting to show her age. Renovations are needed otherwise fantastic stay. Everything is clean and my room was quiet with all the entertainment going on. I do look forward to going back soon
50,It is a very lovely hotel. The only things were we saw a cockroach in the hallway the size of a globe grape. I definitely wasn’t comfortable sleeping in a dark rm after that and on the last day it smelled weird . Also acros the hall in 2 rms were a group of kids who were playing in the hallway and just too loud.
10,It is an older hotel in desperate need of update but I would have given it an 5+ if it wasn't for the terrible service we received at the Public House on our last day. Our server was Isela.    We are all MGM Rewards members and our party of 7 had 3 My Vegas $20 off $40 rewards. We were upfront about it and asked for separate checks in order to use them. We were told no and that it was one per table. We requested to split our party up to 3 tables but she would not let us have 3 tables near each other and insisted on putting us at 3 split apart tables because the 3 near each other were not her section even though we were the only ones in the general area and the tables we wanted two of which were in her area were only 2 steps away.    She finally took our orders after making us split up and wait for some time and then immediately came back to get our MGM cards so she could bring our checks and NEVER came back again. We got tired of waiting and ended up leaving cash instead of paying with card as desired just so we could get out.    We left a small tip because frankly she was awful and did nothing other than collect the reward cards as another person brought our food    She literally chased down a member of my party to ask why the tip was not bigger.    We run a travel vlog and will be providing a review to our followers highlighting this experience.    Our visit was 7/30/22 around 2pm and again the server was Isela.    Imagine one 90 minute meal completely souring a 3 day otherwise pleasant trip.
10,Very concerned housekeeping did not do a thorough job and music from pool area was WAY too loud. Reported to front desk and was told there was nothing they could do. Room was not clean. Everything was over priced.
50,So far so good! My family and I have stayed at Luxor our last three trips to Vegas. We’ve experienced friendly staff and clean rooms with comfortable beds. We plan to continue our stay at Luxor in the future!
50,It was a great experience for my kids. They really enjoyed it their. Everything we need was so easy to get to. I really enjoy spending my birthday their with my family. I can’t wait to come back next year with my family.
30,Very interesting hotel and casino. The design is super cool and the decor with the Egyptian Hieroglyphs is awesome. That said the room was a bit dated the elevators were super slow and sometimes would wipe all of the floors. It was a bit far away from a lot of the venues that we went to but overall it is a decent place.
50,I had a great time just getting away for a couple days here. The hotel was clean the service was always kind and being able to travel between three different hotels by walking or monorail was very convenient. I always enjoy visiting MGM hotels but this will be one of my favorites.
20,My registration was screwed up! I finally got a room after two hours! The room had no USB ports very little electrical outlets. In fact what electrical outlets that are in the room are not near the bed so bring some extension cords.    Staff was very friendly that was a definite plus...
50,I really enjoyed how the Luxor had a 24 hour restaurant and a 24 hour convenient store. My room was clean and comfortable. The Luxor also connects to Mandalay Bay and Excalibur so that itself was fun to travel from casino to casino and still be close distance from your room. The hotel in general is very clean. All in all my experience was an A plus
50,My first time In Vegas!! I booked the Luxor because it wasn’t too expensive but not too cheap either. Our room was beautiful and we had a very nice view. The staff were all great and super friendly! The concierge girl that I call right after booking was able to change my rate for me  because I forgot to add my email for the extra 15% off my stay. She booked me dinner reservations and recommended some amazing places to visit while I was there for the weekend!  The cubano women at the roulette table…she was amazing!!!!
50,The rooms are always a decent price they always nice I never have an issue when I'm in the hotel if I do the staff is very accommodating always have a good time I'm always relaxed I love the games I just enjoy myself I'm in a safe
10,Room smelled I had a headache the whole time we were in there. The bathroom door was broken. Key card didn't work. No customer service any where to be found for help with anything. The fridge was on a table in the middle of the room. The drawers wouldn't stay shut. It was just awful. Stay away far far away!
10,Here to do a little major milestone celebrating and thank you Luxor for disappointing us with your lack of clean rooms and missing housekeeping.  4 days 3 nights after arguing we got clean towels and 3rd night housekeeping came by and did a job equivalent to my kids when they were 10 years old.  Shameful. What hotel thinks it’s okay not to clean rooms daily.  When I spoke to the manager he asked what do you want us to do - oh I don’t know clean my room that I’m paying for. Damn. He made me feel as if I was looking for something- fact is we make more than enough money to pay for our flight rooms food and pretty much anything we wanted to do including 3 shows.  First and last time I stay here - the rooms did not have a coffeemaker - most don’t include a mini fridge. The toilet was dirty - disgusting. SMH. Save your money people.
50,Loved loved loved our experience and stay at the Luxor. We had a suite and it was super spacious and affordable. It had just flooded so our elevator was down which meant a lot of walking but other than that we would definitely stay again.
10,I booked a stay fresh room and the room had a cigarette stench each time the air conditioner kicked in. This hotel is filthy! From the parking lot to the elevators and the bathrooms. The Luxor is in need of some renovation and a deep cleaning. This stay was the last day of our 4 week road trip I wish I would have booked elsewhere. Don’t make the same mistake. There are better hotels in Vegas to stay at.
10,first and last time. I have been coming to Vegas for the past 20years  i am a Dimond plus with Cesar's but i have been exploring my options with the MGM group  what a disappointment .. Luxor needs a new Luxor .
10,The ac doesn't get cold the room is not like the pics. Coats of paint doesn't help with the quality. Housekeeping don't clean properly. It was clipped toenails in-between the bed and night stand. The TV didn't work plus the fridge was missing.
50,"This was a ""staycation"" for my birthday. we live in Vegas and i have not had a vacation in about 4 years....so we took a little bit to save so that we could have a couple days of vacation away from home and celebrate my birthday."
10,I was told my room was ready at 2:30 I wasn’t able to get checked in until a little after 3:00. The hallway going to my room on the 6th floor of the west tower smelled strongly of stale cigarettes and marijuana. My room was in shambles and the hotel staff was not helpful at all. The only good part of my entire stay was the housekeeper that dropped off some extra towels. He was polite and greeted me with a friendly smile. I wish I knew his name because that man deserves more than the rest of the staff I encountered.
30,Dry blood was found on bedsheets. Checked out after seeing it and spoke to front desk. Front desk employee spoke with manager and to my understanding half the reservation was refunded. It was an attempt to rectify the situation.
10,This hotel needs a major overhaul it’s definitely not a 4-star hotel don’t believe the photos it smelled so bad carpet was dirty broken cabinets AC didn’t work properly I slept on top of the blanket
30,There was no shower door. I had to use towels to soak up the water 💧💦. The resort fee was higher than I usually have to pay. Usually as a retired military person my resort fee is waived but I guess the Luxor needed the fee to get the shower door fixed.
30,It was a very pretty hotel but the bed was so uncomfortable it felt like I was sleeping on ply wood Also neighbors tried to come in my room through out the night through the conjoining room door and kept waking me up. Very disappointed!
10,This used to be a great hotel to stay at but the quality of the stay has entirely gone down hill. The customer service was not up to par along with the rooms not being kept up to date or truly being cleaned to Covid standards.
10,Unsafe dirty everything broken or spotted and nasty smells like cigarettes 24/7. Clientele was sooooooo ghetto and unsafe. Elevators broken and unsafe. Everything in the room was rusted or broken or dusty. The front desk people definitely hate their jobs.
10,Found bed bugs in my original room. Front desk moved me to another room and said I’d be comped the first two nights for the inconvenience. Checked out and my folio did not reflect the two comped nights promised. Front desk stated they needed to wait on the results from OSHA before they could issue a refund. So ridiculously gross and understaffed.
20,I wasn’t expecting to hate it here as much I did. It was my first time staying here and I honestly was not pleased. To start you would assume that as a guest you would get free parking but nope not at all. I checked in and I was placed on the 15th floor inside the pyramid and the elevators required your key to just to reach your floor which was annoying. The elevator took forever to reach the 15th floor and it was very hot and packed inside the elevator. When arriving at my room I walked into a room that was completely trashed. The reason why I’m even giving this place a 2 star review is because they placed me in another room that was clean but even then it wasn’t great. Over all it was ehh and I probably won’t be back.
40,Excellent place to stay in Vegas!! I would definitely recommend staying at the Luxor. Friendly staff clean room and plenty to do while here. There was easy access to other hotels and a variety of restaurants to choose from. Great place to stay!
50,I have been to Las Vegas about 5 times now and have always stayed at the Luxor. I have never had any bad experience with the hotel. I stay in the Tower rooms and they have always been lovely. The East Tower is closest to reception and the West tower is closer to the pool depending on preference. The theme of this hotel is what made me fall in love with it. I will continue to keep coming back and enjoying my vacations at this hotel.
10,Room keys never work there front desk line is always a 30 minute plus wait. The customer service is horrible. Got stuck in the elevator for like 25 minutes because the room keys do not work. Then when you go to get a new room key its another 30 minute wait in line. Spent more time at the front desk with issues then freetime.
40,Great time! Only one issue! I did have a small issue with the room but it was resolved and the frontdesk was very nice to me and understood my concern. Overall this is the nicest hotel with the best value!
10,The Luxor was full of dust. The elevators shake and are also dirty. The bedsheets were dirty in both rooms given to me. the tv didn’t work. the room was always hot. the staff is rude. the hotel room bathroom sink was clogged. the hotel smelled of water and mold.
40,Room was clean and was what I expected. This hotel is a little dated but the room was good and was taken care of by your staff throughout the week. Check in was a bit of a pain and the line was extensive for check in.
40,Overall we were satisfied with the Luxor the only thing missing was a refrigerator and a coffee maker!!! The rooms are very and comfortable and the bathroom was spacious!!! This was my wife’s first time staying at the Luxor and she was overall impressed. Thank you!
30,Room is ok and clean the bed was too soft. The cover self parking space was very limited. Very long and hot walk in the summer from self parking lot to lobby.    Price was reasonable over all you pay what you get just another average.
20,Room was damp and musty making our items damp. At 1 am a super loud alarm went off repeating the same message at an ungodly volume for 10 minutes. Also called the front desk and never got answered the day we checked in.
40,The casino is very nice but staff is not knowledgeable of certain questions but they were very nice. The rooms are nice very roomy but needs to be cleaned better but with the shortage of workers I can forgive them in this area.
40,I have never wanted to book rooms here but it was the most inexpensive room on the strip upon arrival.. I was amazed how the room was so clean and felt like staying on an upscale hotel. For the value of it.. it was worth staying in this hotel.  Downside was. The food at the buffet was ……. Hmmmmm … I prefer to eat at McDonald’s🤦🏻‍♀️ They have to do something with their selections… I’m for sure they can cook better than what it is now. I was hesitant to eat at the buffet but I wanted to experience it myself… all the vloggers were right… it’s definitely not worth spending the money there.. if only if I can get my money back as I didn’t even end up eating the food.  Pool was nice great Dj!!!…. Drinks were too expensive. I prefer to bring my own no one checks lolll… I’m for sure a lot of pool crashers as well .. I can tell there were plenty of people at the pool that were not even guests of the hotel.. makes the pool look cheap without anyone checking if they are a guest or not.  I will definitely recommend this hotel for what the value is.  I know it’s an old hotel.. don’t expect to see someone polishing the elevator doors for what you are paying for.
30,In general the facility was very dirty trash everywhere and cleaning/disinfection was not kept up with. Considering we are still in the midst of a global pandemic the cleaning was definitely subpar. Customer service was lacking as well. The staff were unpredictable. Some people were super nice and helpful and some were rude and condescending.
40,I would recommend this property if you are looking for a room on a budget. There is plenty to do in this resort which helps because there is nothing to do outside like if you are center strip. Food options are ok. The room I had was ok. The view was not good at all and it smelled a little funny. Other than that the room was nice. This is a great entry level property with a lot going on.
20,Employee named AG and manager Kevin are very rude they will over talk you not answer questions or even acknowledge when you. It started with AG I walked up needing assistance checking in because the mobile check in wouldn’t work after she checked me in I asked about the mobile room key and she stated that I can only get that my doing mobile check in and then continued to cancel my check in. I asked her why she canceled my check in when I was just asking a question and then she stated I can go to the mobile check in line. I asked to speak with a supervisor and that’s when Kevin came over he never asked me what was going on never asked me how he could assist me never apologized for his employee being rude he thought it was great customer service to be rude himself!!!!!! I was soooooooo embarrassed and frustrated it my entire trip! And good luck finding a customer service phone number that doesn’t go to the person you are trying to complain about smh!!!
10,Bad service room smelled like mildew and not clean.Try to get help or resolve the issue it was not taking care of…. I would not recommend no one to this hotel they don’t take care of there customers at all
50,We were extremely satisfied with our visit for my twin sons 21st birthday trip!! They had an amazing time and so did the rest of my family! It was fun watching them celebrate their 21st birthday in Las Vegas!!
50,Easy to get around; good signage and floor plan; helpful friendly accommodating knowledgeable and responsive staff; more afternoon shows for children would be an improvement; did not use pool but heard it is great.
30,This hotel feels slightly outdated compared to others on the strip although that is reflected in the price. We arrived and the check in process felt very long not only because of the queue but just in general. The lady was polite but struggled to find our details despite me asking her if she wanted to see my confirmation email. We did swap one of the rooms for my in laws so they were on a lower floor but when they got to their room they found half eaten cake knickers missing towels and dirty sheets. It was 12pm by this point so they complained the following day. They were given $100 credit to their room but I’d have rather just had a clean room and towels personally. It’s worth noting if you don’t like heights then ask for a lower room in either the pyramid or the towers.    The casino area was ok very similar to casinos here in the UK if you have been up any of the Genting ones. The vouchers that the machine gives you can only be used in that hotel so it’s worth cashing out via one of the ATM machines if you want money. The machines charge $9 per cash withdrawal this is for cash from your bank card not a charge to withdraw your winnings. They also split money too ie $20 note into $1s which can be handy. I didn’t see many ATMs on the strip it seems the hotels have dominated the need to obtain cash.  You can get drinks bought you you it’s cheaper than buying them but you need to tip. It can take a while for the workers to get to you and then back again. I’d ask for water with your usual drink as it’s very expensive at the hotel and despite there being water machines around none of them worked.    The nearest/cheapest supermarket is a walk down to the strip 15 mins or so. It’s worth stocking up on water here as it’s significantly cheaper. Food in the hotel/hotel food courts is pricy and not the best in my opinion But it’s convenient. Remember tax is added separately and most transactions ask if you want to tip. There are plenty of Starbucks in hotels so you won’t struggle for coffee.  I found it all less 24/7 than I was told. Breakfast generally starts from 8am and some food places even shut at 3pm. Some staff were polite and enthusiastic and some just didn’t want to be there. It was very mixed.    The pool was full most days and there are no umbrellas with the beds. You can rent a ‘posher’ day bed but this was pricy. The gym is free to use but the sauna/spa area was $30 for hotel guests too.    The lifts aren’t well sign posted in my opinion. You could see people coming and going we’re also struggling to find them or determine which ones were the right ones for their tower or area.  Walls between the rooms are quite thin you could hear a lot of noise of people passing by and just in general.    The room was spacious and had the basic amenities. We didn’t have a remote for the TV to begin with so had to request one. You might think you’re in vegas and want to watch tele? Well yeah when jet lag hits you and it’s 4am but your body thinks it’s midday you’d probably want to watch TV to pass the time too.    There is free Wi-Fi in the hotel it’s easy enough to join. It will also reconnect throughout other MGM owned hotels too. You can walk directly through to both the Mandalay and The Excalibur via this hotel.  We had the Buffett one day it’s $30 pp during the week for the breakfast one. Plenty of choice and food was nice just pricy. We waited a while to be seated as it’s seems people with MGM rewards memberships are seated first.    All in all it was ok. I wouldn’t rush back. But as I said at the start this hotel is price reflective.
50,My mom and I had a great time. We stayed at Luxor for a week and everything was amazing. Check in process was super easy and the staff were very friendly. And the check out process was easy as well. We’ll definitely be back.
40,Hotels of this level should not try to limit services and charge for simple items. No coffee provided in the rooms. No microwave. No refrigerator but you can pay extra. Overall had a fun time with family
20,The beds are so comfy I slept good.  The elevator suck ass took forever sacs only 2 worked.    …………………………….……………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………..
40,Thus was a nice hotel to stay at our only problem was we had some things stolen from our room it had to be one of the maids they took a whole bag of medication not only did that happen but when I went down to make a police report the staff was very rude
40,Thus was a nice hotel to stay at our only problem was we had some things stolen from our room it had to be one of the maids they took a whole bag of medication not only did that happen but when I went down to make a police report the staff was very rude
30,I have booked a room with two bedrooms. Doing in-app checkin got the wrong type of room. No other issues observed. Staff was helpful service was good. Casino staff friendly. In-App checkin and checkout helped a lot to avoid lines
10,Not what I expected on the suite I picked. Room was not cleaned run down with light fixtures out of socket and nasty stained furniture YUCK!!!! Nail clippings left of floor next to the bed…………………………..
50,♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️I love the stay 💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋why so much everything was fabulous everything was good and I will definitely recommend this place so I will definitely will love to go back and stay there
40,The hotel is nice and clean. Our room is big although not a good view.. but clean and spacious.. however the elevator wasn’t working and the lady who checked us in didn’t mention about it.. theres only a sign that’s not working not even direction which elevator we can use. Location is good too. Pool is big and nice..  food court are expensive…  The buffet is affordable.
20,The rooms smelled the elevators were down and the hotel is dirty. This was my destination wedding and it was ruined. There was trash on every roof top looking down from the balancing floor. I do not recommend this hotel. We will never be retuning.
20,I was exited for my trip until I got my room the room felt damp and smelled like it too. the tv didn't work. I had to call front desk. they send someone to fix it but Idk after that i was like meh. the damp room and smelled never went away. so yeah my experience wasn't great.
40,Been to the Luxor several times. For the most part I have good experiences here. My only take back from here is the fact that there is no fridge and microwave in the rooms that are not suites. Would it hurt the casino to invest in a putting a mini fridge and microwave inside the rooms? But for the most part for the newcomers the Luxor's got it going on! The buffet is awesome! Front desk folks superb. And I had no idea that I can use my rewards card at the slots?
50,Room was great bed was super comfy  Had a fridge and tub in the room for a $25 upgrade. Ate at public house beers were good food was good service was exceptional and fast. Was hard to find a server while gambling.
10,We found the cap of a needle in our chair and were worried about poking ourselves on a needle. Tried to call customer service about it and waited over 45 minutes with no answer. It was fine for a bed but that definitely was not acceptable
40,Toilet too low and not comfortable to use. Need room to be more cooler. Room service needs to be more better. Club card member line service needs to lot better. Get rid of the smoke smell. The air filter system needs to better.
10,After checking into our room we found the bathtub in our room to be dirty with chunks of hair in it and pieces of the bottom of the tub peeling off. We asked if it could be cleaned again we were told it would take two hours and agreed and went to tour the city. After returning hours later we found there were more towels in our room but the tub was still not clean and the hair was still in it. Instead of waiting for another two hours for it to get “cleaned” again we cleaned it ourselves.  The staff in general were not very friendly the bar tenders were extremely rude.  Also there were a ton of people in the hotel offering free stuff if you’re willing to go to the other end of the strip and sit through a two hour time share. You couldn’t walk through the hotel without someone trying to stop you to sign up for a time share tour. It was very frustrating as you’re there to relax and have fun and don’t want to be stopped multiple times a day with the same sales pitch.  The rooms are not very updated and the walls are very thin we could hear all the conversations of the couple next door as well as very time they left their room their door slamming.  And don’t pay for a late check out I paid $30 extra for a late check out and housekeeping was banging at our door at 10am trying to clean for the next guests we told them we had a late check out and they apologized and then came back again at noon. I thought the purpose of a late check out was for you to use the room until you leave at 3 not being disturbed and trying to be hurried out.  I would never stay here again and would not recommend this hotel to anyone.
20,Daily parking fees on top of daily resort fees and at the end you realize you could have stayed somewhere much better for the same price. Rooms need renovation and upgrading. Casino cashiers keep  Calling their boss for approval when your winning ticket is above $3000.
10,The music is loud and rubbish by the pool. Tried to move away from speakers and moved a bed from one side to the other only to be told we were not allowed to move one bed!! Robotic and impolite staff who are jobs worth's. Very disappointed with this hotel and customer service. Others around the pool agree the music is too loud and completely awful!!  There is no shade unless you pay a ridiculous amount of money and bags are checked in an abrupt manner every day.  I went to Caesars palace pool for the day which was so much better and classier than this poor place will not be coming here again or recommending it to anybody in the uk!!!!!😡
50,Great hotel! Easy check-in clean quiet everything worked in the room. Great price! Pool was amazing as well as hotel amenities! Didn’t have to leave for anything if we didn’t want to! Will stay here more often!
20,To be fair I'm not big on casinos but I was invited to present at a conference being hosted at the Luxor so I decided to take advantage of staying here since it was the official conference hotel.    Things I liked:  Check-in from MGM mobile app  - Digital key (though this had some issues I'll talk about in a second)  - Not having to wait to check-in our check-out  - Covered walkways to nearby hotels (Excalibur and Mandalay Bay)  - Easy pickup spot for rideshare services (Uber)  - Bartenders at Public House (they treated me very kindly)  - Silver Star Chocolate Cake at Public House was really good.    Things I didn't like:  - The rooms are not as up to date as I'm used to  - No USB ports anywhere in the room  - Casino smells like smoke and it hits you as soon as you walk in (to be fair nearly all - of the casinos allow smoking which for the life of me I don't understand)  - Buffet is overpriced for what you get  - On-property restaurants SUCK. HARD. Obvious they're using days old meat because it all tastes like cardboard (ribs chicken prime rib all tasted awful)  - Wi-fi access is spotty near the elevators and the MGM app takes way longer than you'd expect to load so even if you pull your phone out and load the app while waiting for the elevator you'll have to wait on the next one to come because the app hasn't loaded yet. You have to use your key to be able to press the button to go to your floor. Also you can't go to any other floors if your key isn't coded for that floor (so much for visiting friends unless they're physically with you)  - My room wasn't fully clean when I arrived (trash bag sitting on the desk brown dried up stain underneath bathroom sink)  - Room windows are shaded so no there's no way to get that good wake up light in the morning. That's because each side of the pyramid is an advertisement so when you're looking at it from inside one of the rooms you're seeing a small section of the screened on advertisement as you're looking out of the window. No one considered how tacky this is?  - The overall closed-in environment just feels icky and claustrophobic. I'm not much of an outside person but I was begging for fresh air and sunshine after being stuck in that hotel for two days straight.    Overall I wouldn't stay at this hotel by choice again. Mandalay Bay and MGM Grand had much better food options and the environment of both just felt better (though the smokiness was still a problem). If you just need a cheap place to stay during a mid-week trip to Vegas and don't need anything luxurious this will do but you'll definitely want to eat elsewhere.
50,The staff was friendly. The room was clean except for light fixtures had makeup residue. The beds were comfy. The staff at Pyramid Cafe were excellent. Went to see the Titanic exhibit and stayed at Luxor for convenience.
10,Traveled with my 11 yr old daughter. Upon entering our room there was a naked man in our room. The front desk apologized and gave us a room by the pool. Definitely not compensated adequately for the distressing event.
10,Male subject defecated urinated and vomited in the pool I was in. Staff and security took too long to advise the guests and remove the male subject. Was very gross hotel didn’t have antibacterial soap to shower with. Very disgusted.
40,Loved the iconic hotel design room was clean and very comfortable queen beds bathroom clean and modern essential toiletries provided. Low level continuous humming background noise even when AC off. Unfortunately no mini fridge in the room and no food outlets later in the evening to be able to grab a reasonably priced soft drink or piece of fresh fruit supermarkets quite far to walk to.
30,The location and stay was nice. Disappointed with no microwaves or refrigerators. The waitresses while playing slots where hard to get drinks from as they were never around. Overall Average stay because of location gave it the bigger boost.
50,Great stay. Fantastic customer service helpful staff. Very clean rooms. Restaurants were good. Thanks to all the workers there!! No bad things to say! (Parenthesis only here to meet the ridiculous 200 character minimum 😃)
40,It was fun until I had to use my key in the elevator to go to my room it wouldn’t work at all. Had to go get a new key and out of four key cards only one work! Is a struggle when your going with your kids
20,Would be better if the staff wasn’t rude. Also AC didn’t work that well. TV was pixelated and kept shutting off.    Why are hallways and elevators not air conditioned AT ALL???    Size of the room was good. Cleanliness was good.
50,Excellent check in service with your phone! You can print your keys and don’t make a long line to check in and get them. Easy and fast and very simple for anyone with a phone! Super fast getting into self parking also with your phone!
40,We enjoyed our trip to Vegas and the hotel was good but could be better and cleaner.. The displays were very dusty and the check in process is so long.. I ended up having to use the app to speed up the process to get our room
40,After relaxing for a couple of hours we decided to go enjoy the pools only to discover they closed at 6pm. Very disappointing. Wanted to cool down some before dinner & couldn't. Also everytime the air conditioner came on the overwhelming smell of pot came with it. Slept with the covers over my nose most of the night. I've only had this experience in Las Vegas.
30,There could have been better amenities in the room. The bath tub was not working well. The water barely came out. The shower hot water was inconsistent. No trash bags in the trash cans. Very loud you could hear everyone around you.
50,Everything and everyone were great. This will be in the list of places to stay in the future………………………………………………………………..’znznznznzznnznznznznznnznznznznznznznznznznznznnznznznznnznznznznxnxnxnxnx
40,Old hotel but overall a good stay. Elevators are a unique experience.  Staff is friendly and accommodating.  We would stay here again. The corner suite rooms are the best for the 3 of us. Two tv’s living area and a small fridge was a plus.
50,It took us about 11 minutes walking from Allegiant Stadium to the Luxor !! I really recomend this place .. also the parking is very close to the casino / hotel entrance.. we did not have to walk a very long distance!!
50,"I found our room pleasant. The carpeting appeared to be stained as if from ""work boots"" and needed cleaning. Room was otherwise clean & acceptable. Spacious suite. Comfortable furniture. Great bed. IN room refrigerator & safe."
30,My stay was ok. I just didn’t or couldn’t enjoy my shower since I went on a hot weather week. I went with the family also they also couldn’t enjoy the shower. I did enjoy gambling in the casino I won some and lost some.
10,Honestly I would rather stay at a Motel 6 because at least you are aware of the horrible experience you will receive. The rooms don't have fridges the elevators are falling apart pay for parking nightly but have your car surrounded by homeless people oh and the homeless people can walk right in and take your drinks off the slot machines you are playing!
40,Met expectations. Ambience was a little-lacking compared to some of the other themed hotels (like New York or Caesar's Palace) but our room was clean the MGM app made checking-in and parking a breeze and there was easy walkable access to other casinos on the strip.
30,Don’t go to sleep before you check your covers and walls for cockroaches. There was some in the bathroom and then there was some crawling on the walls. I heard my girlfriend scream and I had to come to the rescue with the tissue to grab them and sling them into the toilet to their demise.
40,I stayed at Luxor for 2 nights from Fri to Sun and had not stayed there previously. It exceeded my expectations because it was very nice and clean in the hotel and the room. Also my kids enjoyed the pool so much. Definitely will come back.
50,Luxor is still one of the great hotels in Vegas pool area is great casino floor is comfortable with no smoking issues as the smoke rises up high into the pyramid. Rooms are a great value although a little dated well maintained.
30,Because the Luxor has inexpensive rooms I reserved 3 rooms for our Girls Trip. Two of the 3 rooms had issues with air conditioning that was reported but not repaired. We also asked to be moved to other rooms; that didn't happen either. Now they have removed refrigerators from rooms too. It is probably my last stay ay Luxor.
10,Clogged sink and raining in the room.    The clogged sink is staying clogged as I call them and they never come.  And I am currently waiting for the raining from the ceiling … it will be very short… it is 10.30 pm and they do not come. I call and call… they never show up. Terrible.  The bathroom is very dirty.  I do not mind the run down but the dirty 🤢
30,Stay at Luxor everytime I visit Vegas (5th visit). Everything is always good; however this trip wasn’t so great. First soap dish crashed in the bathroom sounding like the roof was coming down; I slipped in shower (no slip grip in shower) and have a huge bruise on my leg. Next my car was hit while in valet but no one wanted to do anything. Finally upon checking out valet couldn’t find my car which left me rushing to airport. SMH…..disappointed
40,Stayed at the Luxor and had a blast. I will be definitely be staying here again and look forward to the new exhibition. Great customer service and saved $$$. Recommend mgm rewards as well. Beautiful pool.
40,It has been over 10 years since we stayed at the Luxor. Our expectations were not great but were pleasantly surprised. Our room was great very modern and roomy with a nice view. The casino is awesome too. In addition to that we got a great rate for a Saturday check-in.
10,$200 was stolen from our room when our friend crumpled it up and put it near his clothes in the corner. We were told it was our fault and we should’ve paid attention to where we put our stuff. $140 is supposed to be comped from our room but it hasn’t happened and that isn’t the full amount stolen. Highly do not recommend this unprofessional establishment.
50,Very affordable room prices! Delicious Restaurants and wonderful Swimming Facilities!Great place for family fun and fine Dining!!Great access to adjoining Casinos and also local stores!!!Great in house entertainment and shows to pick from!
10,I don’t recommend this place for families by our 3rd day we caught Covid. Elevators was always packed no one wearing mask. Valet Parking they charge guest who stays there $30 but non guest $20 makes no sense they should go above and beyond for guest who stays there
40,Great location friendly staff easy access to strip lots of restaurants to choose from...tram is definitely a plus...rooms need to be updated...terrible TV reception no fridge or microwave necessities on vacation.
20,Not what I expected for my first time here in Las Vegas. The room was decent but was not cleaned from prior guest and a piece of chewed up gum and hair was in the tub. The mobile app for the key does not work properly so get a key at check in. Be prepared to wait a long time to check in. Long wait times for phone answering and also make sure you know where you are staying due to elevators.
10,Airport noise all night. Unable to sleep. This was after asking for a quiet room. Moved to a new room the second night and it was still very noisy plus the room was old and worn out. Very disappointing.
10,Bad service. No coffee maker in the room. Extremely long check in and check out lines.I Had to hold for 15 mins to talk to someone at guest services. I Will not go to this hotel again and won’t recommend it.
40,"Rooms are clean and comfortable. If I have any critique of the hotel it's the ""inclinator"" type elevators that have to be utilized if you stay in the ""pyramid"" section of the hotel. They are extremely slow and never have I stayed there where an entire bank of elevators is operational. For that reason I would alway request a low floor so the stairs can be an option at all times. Otherwise during midweek this hotel is a great bargain for the pricing. Nothing else to be critical of just be aware that the elevators may be a challenge."
10,check-in day- someone was already in our room. New room next day the AC broke and started flooding the room. 3rd room keys only worked once to let out the parking lot then they stopped working. What a nightmare.
40,Good stay at the Luxor. Online check-in was easy. A little hard to find the elevator to our room. The room was spacious and clean. The hotel could you use a little bit of updating but overall is in good condition. We liked being able to walk inside to the Mandalay Bay for dinner.
40,Decent stay at the Luxor but it could have been better.  Did not seem the room was vacuumed thoroughly on the 1st day.  They forgot to replace the used towels on the 1st day of housekeeping.  Thank goodness for the air conditioning working properly in the room as our arrival day tipped 115F.  Food was decent at the property but as like most other bigger Casino/Hotel Resorts alike there was no buffets being at night.  Despite some minor challenges the Luxor was a great pick for the value being charged.  We will be back again!
50,The front desk customer service was amazing and very helpful! The Luxor Cafe had an amazing Benedict breakfast item which I really enjoyed! The hotel and casino was very clean and housekeeping provided great service as well.
30,I pretty much got what I paid for as far as the room goes. Sadly I used another provider and not MGM directly. I had extra stuff to pay upon check-in...yay surprise! Lines to do anything that related to customer service during the normal work day. Late night you might not find anyone to help with anything.    I asked for a room with a view. I literally got the crack of the Sphinx's buttcheeks.
40,The elevators are not clean and it seems like they are going to fall apart any minute. It seemed like i was going thru thunderstorm while flying in a plane. The room was overall clean however the desk glass in the room was not clean. Also Luxor should provide some basic amenities in the room like coffee toothpaste etc
30,Help needs in day one should have someone available to help direct guests to the right elevator use the room key in the elevator we had to go back 2 times to be able to get in to the right elevator and the room
10,The room smelled unsanitized and they brought a small fridge that unable to close. A horrible experienced!!!! This is my first and last stay at this hotel. I will not recommend this hotel at all. Honestly we'd rather stay at small hotels with a cleaner environment. My daughter and I were disappointed. She's leaving for college and really had a bad time so we decided to leave and returned back to CA.
10,After two dirty rooms and a upgraded room our trip finally started. Overall the service was ok. But it's unacceptable to be put in two dirty rooms to start with. The manager did make the proper accommodations to help with the situation.
10,The elevators were dirty and crowded. The room bathroom was dirty. Saw hair on the counters toilets are old and shower looked disgusting. Stayed at the aria and went to the Luxor for a few hours prior to flight. Biggest mistake of my life.
10,This was the worst stay I’ve had at a hotel. The biggest factor being that I got to the room at 1:30am and by 8:30am I had TWO housekeeping staff enter my room WITHOUT knocking. The first lightly tapped on the door as the door was being unlocked. The second just unlocked and entered. My stay was just for one night. That is absolutely never okay to do to a guest.
50,My first time in Vegas! Birthday vacation with my boyfriend.🥳🥰 Definitely my place to stay my next trip! Had to take a 2hr tour on my bday🙃 but it was worth it in the end. Nice perks 😁 Luxor Luxor 🙌🏾
20,I was charged an additional resort fee for requesting an additional night. Resort fee ($100) + Room ($85). Ridiculous! The resort fee is to be refunded that isn’t a deal!!! It’s a rip off! Although my flight was delayed and I checked in the following morning. I was still charged for the full day it was booked.
10,This hotel is the SPIRIT AIRLINES OF CASINOs. We for 30 anniversary. King suite room was a Dump. 35 resort fee no coffe maker in room no microwave. Digital key does not work. Wife waited by elevator for an hour while I had to get key. Room was dump. Toilet paper was 6 ft from seat
30,Good hotel for the price . Long walk to the center strip . Clean room but needs some update for bathroom .food court has just burgers and sandwich… no Asian or other choices . Overall just minutes walk can get you any food or anything you need …
40,The hotel is a bit old but the hotel staff keeps it clean everyday. I stayed in the East Tower and not the Pyramid part of the hotel. Check in experience is not the best I suggest checking in thru the app on your way to the airport because the line is long and service inside the hotel is bad. Wifi is also slow. The bed was kinda low but comfy and the pillows were soft. The location is great because you can walk thru each hotel nearby the strip using the walkway to avoid most of the outside heat or use the tram. The room dont have a fridge we made it work by using the ice bucket and the cups provided. it would be nice if the ice bucket is bigger so we can at least have 2 bottles in there to compensate for no fridge in the room.
50,My husband had a stroke on our March vacation  this trip was his redo and he had a great time ! The heat was a bit much and the pool needs a bit more shade but other then that it was a great vacation.
30,Room was dirty and it needed to be remodeled. There also should be a microwave in each room. There wasn't. Could use more refills on coffee and the like should not have to ask. Overall it was ok but not worth what I spent.
50,Easy check in check out. Great app. No need to do any lines!! Clean comfy room in the pyramid. Lots of things to do and easy access to other hotels. A lot of walking though. Self parking in an issue sometimes cause they share their spaces with sporting events.
50,"Went out to Vegas just for a 1 day/night stay. My lady and I enjoyed our time and we wouldn't say we're the ""Vegas Type"" of people. The Luxor staff was very friendly. We walked to the Brooklyn Bowl for a concert and enjoyed the views of the city on the way. I recommend checking out the Bodies Exhibit at the Luxor as it is very informational and interesting."
40,Very nice hotel loved the pool though not all pools were open. First room A/C did not work properly and room was too hot to be comfortable. Front desk sent up maintenance and a fan but did not fix the problem. Eventually gave us a new room and our stay was much more enjoyable.
30,Overall our stay was pleasant. The cleanliness of our room was questionable (several hairs found on surfaces) the nearest elevator was out of service the whole week of our stay and the part of the hotel where we were seemed to be in need of repairs/renovation.
20,Front desk not friendly at all during check in or check out. Also we were told someone would be up to fix toilet and sink. No one ever came to fix. Toilet took 5-6 flushed to clear it and sink never drained long hair in several spots throughout room as well as tiny glass pieces behind bathroom door. Will not stay here again
20,"We have stayed at the Luxor in the past even after Clooney called it a sh*&ole in ""Up in the Air"". We laughed at the line in the movie but thought it was a little harsh. Now it seems spot on.    First of all the enormous wait for check in is annoying. We decided to download the app and check in using the app to get digital room keys. Sadly the digital room keys on the app don't seem to work at all. We tried them over and over in the elevator to no avail. We went to different elevators in our designated elevator bank (there were four in our designated bank #3) and finally a fellow guest helped us by using his key and pressing our floor number. When we finally got to our room and tried the digital key on the door it appeared to work for a second (flashed green) but the door would not open. About another dozen tries later the door miraculously opened. Eventually we went to a kiosk and printed room keys.    The elevators to our floor (19) were positively terrifying and I am not a shrinking violet (I like to scuba dive am adventurous etc). They wobble like crazy and one elevator kept opening and closing the doors after we got in on floor 19 regardless of what we would do. We were literally trapped on our floor because the elevator would not go anywhere while the doors kept malfunctioning. We eventually got out but then we couldn't get another elevator in the bank because as soon as you hit the button the haunted/broken elevator would open its door and try to entice you in. Eventually we decided to find the stairs. They were very dingy but I suppose they don't expect the guests to use them. We went down one floor and were able to get an elevator there. Mind you this was at checkout so we had all our suitcases with us. Super annoying.    The room was OK clean with nice linens and effective AC.    We pre-paid for parking on the app but on departure from the garage there was no way to get the parking machine to recognize our payment using the app. We had to call for help using the intercom.    Really - this place is totally decrepit and non-functional. Deferred maintenance to the extreme."
10,Spend more $$ and stay elsewhere. The quality here has beem greatly diminished. Was my favorite now Ill never come back. Was charged for leaving early and not refunded for the day I rufused to stay. Moved hotels
10,The staff member who checked us in was rude and left a terrible taste in our mouths to start what should have been a pleasant stay. In addition the room had low quality pillows and temperature control. I will not return to this property to stay again.
40,Booked online so I can use mobile check-in. Upon arrival mobile check-in wasn’t working so had to wait in a very long line for check-in. The West wing was an extremely long walk from the front desk. Not many food choices. The room was very clean and nice but lighting was too dark. Tip: ask for a room away from the elevators.
40,Off the strip away from all the hustle and bustle but a close enough walk when I’m ready to indulge. From the time we arrived we felt like family. The restaurant choices where great and the staff were exceptional
10,The service was just terrible. From loud noises next door to security doing nothing then getting pressured by staff to go to time share even if we refused. When asking staff for help or questions almost all didn’t help
50,Very good trip. Luxor was awesome and had great views and the soaking tub was great. I was hoping it was a jacuzzi tub with the spa nets but it’s ok. Still was awesome and comfortable. Love the views from the room.
10,Sink is clogged water is coming out in the shower while taking a shower I have to use towels to soak and dry the floor. Whoever who designed the Ishower wall to the right rather than  putting a shower door so the water won’t be coming out the pressure of the water was great though the room is clean.I got this room as a complimentary for one night it doesn’t matter if it’s a complimentary room you still have to pay for the resort fee. You want your guests to come back. I saw a lot of bad reviews so I don’t get hook up to this resort anymore not happy and satisfied not highly recommended
10,Exposed water pipes  slow draining in the sink. Water leaks in the bathroom. Had a connected room which was used for everything since the other bathroom smelled and had water damage. Was inconsiderate to my other guest party . Only comp one night stay. Needless to say I checked out early
30,My stay at the Luxor hotel was difficult to manage because some of my family was on a different floor. My child got sick and it was difficult to get medication to her on another floor. I was in a wheelchair and the security did not offer any help.
40,This hotel could use some work but it's overall decent. I would have liked a fridge in the room my towels were left on the floor when they cleaned my room the elevators are pretty bad diablos was nasty but the Cafe was amazing better coffee than Starbucks and a much shorter line. I would not reccomend this hotel for kids there is smoking on the casino floor.
40,Enjoyed our one-night stay at the Luxor but the view is the worst I’ve ever had. All we could see outside our window was mechanical equipment immediately outside our window and a large dead bird. We were only staying one night otherwise I would have demanded another room.
10,Our room was given away to a “preferred guest” even though we reserved & paid for the room 7 months prior. We found out when we arrived to check-in!  We were downgraded in our room and forced to accept their ‘slap-in-the-face’ offer because we already paid and had no other option.  Check-in Manager was empathetic but could not do anything. A high roller “preferred guest” trumps any reservation. Careful reserving any Penthouse Suites at the Luxor
40,The location is good and the accommodation a spacious King room was comfortable. Staff were friendly and helpful. We were surprised that the rooms had no amenities fridgemicrowave or small coffee maker especially the latter as the Starbucks near reception and the West Tower closed so early- by 5:30pm !
50,Hotel was very clean. Staff members very professional and courteous bathrooms very nicely kept. Pool was also great. Loved the fact that room was very close to the elevator. Hardly any time waiting for elevator to come. Convenient stores always open.
20,Was in town for a Youth Basketball Tournament. I've already said enough the hotel was not what we thought it would be the shower was drained with hair from the previous guess the elevators sucked everything was very expensive Inside the Hotel no refrigerator no microwave and it seems like we were forced to buy everything downstairs. The lady who checked us in was rude and I think it's ridiculous to pay a resort fee $200 incidentals and a parking fee!
40,Me and my family enjoyed the stay and hotel. I’m ready to sign up and become an awards member for the next trip. Even with parking the nights events was held hotel guest had special treatment. I would stay and recommend to family and friends
10,Filthy place dilapidated ratchet. The people there looked either homeless or straight out of the hood. Vomit in the elevator. 10 minute walk to get to my room in the tower from my car and no luggage carts. The closer elevator was broken down so I had to walk further. While trying to find my room I ended up in another elevator that was shaking so violently I feared that it would break down or fall with me inside. Only acceptable thing was the room. The bathtub drain was broken though so still awful. I have stayed at hundreds of hotels while traveling for business this is the worst I have stayed at yet.
10,I paid for a premium room no fridge no microwave. The vending machine didn’t work the ac unit wasn’t working properly. The bathroom was full of pubic hairs even after they came and did a second cleaning. I absolutely hated my stay
40,The check in desk line up was long but to be expected at a peak time. The hotel was a cool shape and the restaurant was delicious. The rooms for the most part were clean We did however find garbage under the mattress and box spring and had a dirty/stained towel. My only other complaint was the view from the hallway looking down was lack luster. dirty dusty tops of businesses down below. Wish it had more appealing view looking down to the main floor. The pools were clean and busy! Wish there were more shade options for the free seating.
10,Dirty casino and hotel with lack of service and hot rooms. They don’t even have enough towels for guest. The second towel we received could not be used because it had a huge dirty spot on it. We won’t be back. Not like any other MGM property on the strip. Pay a hundred more and stay somewhere worthy.
10,The place is filthy dirty gross. Wow what a horror show. Dark and smelly. The line at check was so long (I am guessing that it would’ve taken at least an hour) that I used the MGM app to check in. No problem. Made it to my room and promptly checked back out. This place really used to be a gem. They took care of it. Now one of the worst I have seen on the strip. If they are planning on tearing it down I wish they would go ahead and put it out of its misery. I will try to remember it the way it was.
10,First night has bad experience with the A/C not working. Was 104 degrees outside so you can imagine the room temperature.    Second night I had a cockroach crawl on me while laying in the bed .    Let say it’s my first time ever staying there and will be last .  If I can upload pictures here I would .  Took a picture for evidence
30,Luxor may have been an outstanding spot years ago but it seems to be average at best now. No microwave in suites. Outdated and gaudy decor. just was not what I expected. If we were not charged resort fee and had better rate I would have been more satisfied. Self parking for $18.00 is a bit much but that is everywhere. Valet $30.00 a day but you can valet at all mgm properties. So that was not so bad.
30,Stayed at the Luxor previously a few years ago and stayed in a pyramid room.  This booking was also for a pyramid room when we arrived and checked in we were informed our booked room was no longer available to us and that we had been upgraded at ‘no extra cost to ourselves’ (bare in mind our travel agent had rung the Luxor the previous day to double check and confirm booking with no mention of a problem with room.)  Our up graded room was in the west tower and what a disappointment our view was the side of the pyramid and was dark no fridge no tea/coffee facilities no plug in hand basin safe locked by previous occupants remote for tv didn’t seem to work.  Reception always busy and not prepared to wait in the always present ques contacted hotel via Twitter.  Was contacted by customer care and was offered room back in pyramid but we had already been there 3nights and would have been a pain to pack and move again locksmith sent to sort out safe and engineer sent for tv was offered a fridge but that never arrived. We were assured this was an upgrade as bigger floor space and had a bath.  Staff we came into contact with were all friendly and helpful had lovely meal in the sports bar and would definitely recommend eating there.  Housekeeping towels and beds made daily and the lady was always friendly and smiling.  Room did have iron ironing board and hair dryer.  Pool area had very little shaded areas and not many parasols but plenty of life guards.  We did observe we presume a homeless man in the water feature picking out the money that people had thrown in staff around seemed to be ignoring him the little girl behind us asking why the man was pinching all the wishes.
30,The rooms were subpar and not 100% clean. Soap scum all over the shower head. Musty smelly to the rooms and hallway. Dust and dirt all over the tub. Tile floor sticky. Room didn’t get cleaned until after 8pm on night. Internet and tv were meh. Staff was very friendly. The location was great. The rooms were meh.
50,Check in was easy peasy Luxor is beautiful inside and out. Bed was so comfortable I sleep like a baby definitely staying here again for my next trip to Vegas. Check out is super easy at well simply slip key into check out box and through the phone.
10,If you want a clean modern hotel then you are at the wrong place dated noisy and past it’s sell by date authentic Egyptian theme  clever use of dust  grim and dirt replacing sand in the desert. management view your themed attractions from guest floors above looks like a scrap yard.
40,A nice stay for our family had some confusion on parking but had a great time inside the hotel and walking the strip. The Food Court offered amazing miliatry discounts on the food which was unexpected. The room was nice on the inside but was not fully functional with outlets that would not hold plugs and old curtain rods. One of the lights above the bed hummed loudly so we had to turn them off. Enjoyable time was had by all and the blue man group was amazing though a little loud however the staff was incredibly helpful at all points.
40,The room was nice. I would have liked a fridge in the room because food is very expensive at the food court and alot of money was wasted on food that had to sit out. Other than that the atmosphere was amazing. Easy access to the strip on foot. Housekeeping and staff was great.
40,Rooms were good. Casino was not hitting at all like before. Probably because of covid and casinos are trying to make up for money. Over all it was good. And this goes for all casinos. Hopefully it gets better.
50,It was easy to check in and out. Room was extremely clean. The signs were easy to follow and the elevators were easy to find. The casino restaurants and restrooms were very clean. In all it was a pleasant first stay at the Luxor
40,We had to fly one day different than our family. We checked out of our regular hotel and decided to try the Luxor. Because we had checked out of our hotel we paid for earlier check in. When we checked in at 11 our room was not ready. Fine no problem. An hour later we stood in line for over 30 minutes and asked the status of checking in. The specific room we booked was not ready but they had plenty of other rooms if we would like that. Would have been good to know the first time we went through the line. The rooms are ok. Clean. We really only stayed here because this is a part of Vegas that is an icon.
10,Room was one the dirtiest I’ve ever seen. Hair on bedsheet and in the bath tub. Elevators were completely worn out. Digital keycard works only sometimes. Noises across the rooms are controlled. Rooms are super dark. Carpets were dirty! No coffee machine as a room amenity.  No staff is available to help you properly when needed. Check in lines are the longest. We paid close $400 for one night (Friday check in and check out Saturday). It was definitely NOT worth that price!!!  Will never ever visit again!!!
10,"Our room was dirty. Very dirty. There was bodily fluid on one of the beds so the sheets had not been changed; housekeeping did come fix this. The carpet was dirty and had not been vacuumed well and there was sticky stuff on the dresser top. The cold water faucet was difficult to turn off and there was hair in the shower. I took a shower before bed and there was writing on the mirror ""I'm watching you."" I have seen enough episodes of CSI to be creeped out but even so that just shows the mirror had not been cleaned. I couldn't take it so we left around 3:30 am."
50,Every time I stay at Luxor I am pleased. Parking is reasonable and easily accessible. Staff are very friendly and helpful. Rooms are immaculate. Beds are super comfy. Do yourself a favor and stay here for your next visit to Sin City!
30,Overall a good bang for your buck we had one hiccup at arrival. Room was not cleaned from previous tenant. A clean room was provided 30 minutes later. Staff were apologetic. I'm sure this all due to having a staffing shortage like most places in the US at the moment.
20,Checking in was a slog. It took about an hour. I don't understand what takes so long. I've stayed at many places on the strip. It never took more that 15 minutes. It was ridiculous. And the rooms were crazy hot. I turned the AC all the way down and it never cooled off. We couldn't sleep it was so hot! Choose another place!
40,From check in to check out the staff was friendly and helpful. They go out of their way to make sure your experience is great. The food in the Pyramid Cafe was quick and delicious. That staff was g reat as well. Brittany went out of her way to get me fed and on my way.
20,Mobile check in was a bust. The app never worked properly therefore couldn’t use it to open room. Had to go to the front to get real keys. Our first room was hot and not cooling down so we moved to another room. That room has wet carpet from an apparent leak? At least we hope it was a leak - gross. The NEW showers didn’t have show doors! What ding-dong thought that was going to be a good idea. Get used to wet bathroom floors. Some staff was nice while others were rude. Spend the extra money and go to a better hotel.
10,Wanted to give this hotel a try. Very Pricy for the room to smell like cigarettes had to pay for parking and no refrigerator in room. They say you get what you pay for but in this case I think 500 for two nights is expensive for a poor experience.
20,The room itself was fine. The self-parking was awful. Only one entrance was open and it had A-frame signs saying don't enter here. And I paid $18/day to deal with this. If I hadn't already agreed to this fee in the booking process I would have used the valet service which is $30/day and been MUCH happier. The room itself was fine. The housekeeping was adequate. The irritation of the self parking really spoiled it for us though.
40,Great atmosphere helpful staff and the casino was clean and easy all trip! Msy businesses don't open up if you're an early bird like me but still plenty to enjoy and experience! Corner king suite was definitely worth the money!
10,My friends and I stayed in the Luxor a few days ago. The hotel itself is nice but our stay was completely different. On our second night in Las Vegas my friend was feeling sick so she decided to stay in. At 1:00am we were contacted by our friend. She was alone in the hotel room asleep however a man opened her door and informed her there was “house keeping”. “House keeping” at 1:00am?? She was terrified and did not know what to do. She told the man to get out and waited up all night until we returned as she was so traumatised. The following morning we approached reception and explained that a man had gained access to our room at 1:00am. The compensation my friend received was 80 dollars? This did not cover the trauma she had to endure. Not only did someone trespass into the hotel room but her Louis Vuitton handbag also appeared to be missing after the “house keeping” visit. If you are comfortable with being walked in on when you sleep or even better have your belongings stolen then I would recommend staying in this hotel.
30,The renovated rooms have a good bed and a good shower but the hallways and elevators are pretty beaten up. We had moved out of the MGM signature which is smoke free and has a kitchenette and way classier. This one definitely felt like a Vegas hotel and although the rooms were clean he just had a feeling that the hotel is old and beaten up.  There are no water fountains and there is no kettle or coffee maker in the room and a fridge is an extra $35 which is kind of cheesy.
30,It was an average room an average stay but we were never helped at the casino the waitress never tried to get us a drink even when I try to wave them down so I went up to the bar to get a drink keep in mind I am a bartender myself I asked the bartender if you can give me a drink and he was very rude I thought my drink I still tipped him $5 and I left and never got another drink
30,The Luxor was in good location to be able to visit most of the strip. The rooms were very clean. The drink service in the casino was a little slow. They had a wide variety of games. The food court had several good choices of food.
30,Don't recommend staying at Luxor during Stadium events. Parking was 'full' and hotel guests have to park farther down strip. They should allow hotel guests access. Was a bummer. Rooms just average but clean and the maid staff still gives you towels and make your bed every day..
40,"Definitely impressed with Luxor's rooms and amenities. The ""Stay Well"" rooms are great especially for those with bad sinuses or allergies. The hotel also has a free tram service connecting Luxor with Excalibur and Mandalay Bay. But housekeeping needs improvement."
30,Decently priced other than the resort fee that was as much as the room cost. The staff at front desk were helpful however rude and unfriendly when dealing with them over the phone. The rest of the staff we encountered were helpful and friendly. We had issues with the light switch and toilet in our room but the lines were so busy we couldn’t get through to report it with the front desk.
50,There was no mini fridge which sucked and one of the pools was closed and it was packed! Other than that it was an amazing time beautiful place! I would definitely come here again the tram was also very helpful for those hot days getting closer to the strip!
10,Not worth money way to expensive for the room and stupid because you have a lot of fees. The fridge fee is stupid because you can’t keep your meds cold.not happy wouldn’t do it again. Maybe if it was cheaper
50,Great hotel old but clean with good service. We stayed at the corner room and I truly enjoyed taking bath and look outside to gorgeous view. Be prepared for low popcorn ceiling. There an awesome view outside to the strip and inside to exhibition center concert hall and museum.
50,It was actually quiet and is well located. The cleanliness in the elevators could be better. The room was great and a fair price. We enjoyed the restaurants and the convienance of the variety of places to eat and drink.
50,The suite was beautiful and very spacious!! Perfect for a family! 2 bathrooms living room dining room bar area and a king bed! Mobile check in was a piece of cake no issues we didn’t have to wait in line to check in.
50,I loved my stay at the Luxor the view rooms amenities atmosphere. The Egyptian sculptures were beautiful almost felt like I was in Egypt. The pool is so beautiful and the rooms were my favorite..
40,People list it as one of the worst resorts on the strip but no one can resist its price. $20 per night during weekdays makes it a savor award. And I do believe it is the most noticeable building on the strip at night. For that reason everyone should come to visit at least once if not plan to stay.    The room is actually not that bad although a lot of equipment is missing. The wifi is super slow and constantly disconnects. When checking in the front desk might offer to upgrade to the tower room. I realized later that this is not an upgrade. The tower is far from the entrance and it takes 15 minutes for me to get to my room. If I had another chance I would stick to the pyramid room.
50,Hiccup with the room but over all we love this property and will come back. I’m big on mgm and back y’all! Mistakes happen! People misunderstand and sometimes things just happen! We will be back and can’t wait to see y’all again!
10,This is a very old property that is not properly cared for. We had no air-conditioning in our room and I placed three phone calls in order to get some attention. The maintenance person finally showed up two days later at 11:45 PM. He said the room had poor ventilation but he proceeded to remove the grid and pulled out a filthy air conditioning filter that was marked it from March 8 2021. It had not been serviced in a year in several months. It was disgusting. We also had people smoking marijuana on our floor and the entire floor reek. I can honestly care less whether people smoke or not. However I had children in my party and this was advertised as a family friendly hotel and as a non-smoking hotel. There are signs posted that smoking marijuana is illegal. When I complained at the front desk they told me they wouldn’t do anything about it and essentially told me I was making a big deal out of nothing. Specifically I was told that Vegas is for adults and not children so if I didn’t want my children exposed to marijuana I shouldn’t bring them to Vegas. It was extremely rude. I also had a maid throw out a bag from my room that had toys in it. They told me security was going to come to talk to me but they never showed up. In the end the resort credited my account for some resort fees but that does not even come close to making up for the hours I spent having to deal with nonsense on a four day vacation
40,Comfortable hotel. Wish the temp in the room could've been a little cooler but slept well. Plenty to do on this end of the strip with many options to get further down... didn't feel left out or too far away from the main part of the strip activities.
40,I enjoy the Lexor Hotel. It is always clean the staff is helpfull and friendly and the Rooms are nice. This was the first time I used the Mobile Check-in and it was totally contactless. The app lets you know when the room was ready supplies the Floor and Room Number. All you do is go straight to the room and use your phone as a key.  The Rooms are very comfortable and larger than expected. The only thing missing is a refrigerator. The only other negative is there is no Coffee Shop open in the evenings as it has a limited schedule and closes a 2:00PM. They have also discontinued Room Service which was one of the things I missed the most.
40,excellent stay.....will visit again.....highly recommend if you want a spot away from the chaos but still close to downtown.....rooms staff food and shows were great.......easily connects to Excaliber Tropicana and New York New York.
50,I had a great time everyone was friendly and very helpful.From checking VIP services to the person at the buffet to the steak hose the steak was very tender and juicy cooked too perfectly.The check out at VIP went smooth and helpful.
40,It was a quick vegas trip for a soccer game it was exactly what we needed the room was dark cool and quiet and provided a great place for sleep despite being in a noisy casino. The king bed was incredibly comfortable and the pillows were soft we slept suprisingly well. The location was great for the football stadium we were able to get there without even stepping outside.
30,They brought a single box fan to our room instead of fixing the AC or moving us to a different room after we paid for an upgrade. We were there 5 nights and it was beyond hot. We couldn't barely stand to be in the room.
50,Very clean really easy accessonline check inn- and check out no waiting lines really happy 100 % recommended.you won’t be disappointed really nice pooland very safe for kids good food and 3 Starbucks in place!
50,We like to stay here most of the Times    and We recommend to our Families this Time 16 Family members were there Plus lots of more of Friends  We like to Coming back to the Pkace you feel Confortable trying to go Every year
40,Overall it was a good time. There were long really long lines at check in. There was one rude Roulette dealer. But the majority were nice. The trip from the hotel was lengthy but the room was nice. No fridge or microwave tho. I basically live on the road and this was surprising. Could have paid for a mini fridge to be brought to the room but had already spent thousands of dollars
50,I like the Environment when next i visit i will lodge there the only concern i have is that they did not give us Breakfast with the much money i paid i was there with my kids but no breakfast. I wish to visit again but i will consider the breakfast before booking it again
20,It was okay I guess did not feel like a vacation my experience really wasn’t great .. learned my lesson felt like I stayed at motel 6 nothing special check in staff was horrible I even upgraded and still have to regret my stay
20,The room smelled. The mattress was well beyond wore out. No fridge or for that matter soap in the rooms. Had a smoke detector going off randomly for over 6 hrs. Was going to stay for 3 nights but two was enough and we got out.
40,After hearing years of mixed reviews I took a chance on the Luxor this past week. I have to say… I was very pleasantly surprised! The rooms were inexpensive and perfectly clean! Every staff member we dealt with was kind and attentive. The elevators were a little bit nerve-wracking with the amount of shaking they make going up and down on an angle but we had no problems getting around all week. The pool area was a bit of a disappointment only in that there was no natural shade anywhere. Even if you wanted a few minutes of relief from the sun you had to pay for it. Other resorts I’ve stayed at in Vegas offer more natural shade. The pools themselves were perfectly enjoyable! We ate at the Public House and Diablo’s Cantina and enjoyed them both thoroughly. Using the MGM rewards app we were able to save a good amount of money on both restaurants. Also having the tram readily available to go between the Excalibur and Mandalay Bay properties was a welcome addition to our trip. Overall I was very happy with this stay and will be coming back in two months to the Luxor for another stay. Looking forward to it!
30,Cleanliness was okay not the best. Some people at the cashier for the casino were extremely rude for being first time staying at Luxor makes me not want to go back. The environment was great. The quietness was also good. They need to fix a lot of things in the hotel especially in the rooms and access to go to the rooms example elevators
20,Rooms smell weird took over an hour to get food at the pool even when paying money for a day bed at $150. The food was warm at best on a 110 degree day (it makes no sense). I get your busy and staff shortages but other people received food before us and ordered after us.
50,Fair enough. Things could be better  I enjoyed the ambiance n view. Just wish the shower would drain n ur not in the pool while taking a shower. Sheets need to be properly leaned and changed with no stains. My pillows has stains and all.
10,Customer service at this property was almost non existent. Took seven attempts by phone and in person to get our room made up with extra towels. Tenured employees were familiar with customer service but newer employees do not care about your stay. Escalator to another property was broken linens don’t fit beds and thin walls. Hotel did comp the resort and parking fee for our multiple issues but penalized for leaving a day early. When we left our room the room next to us had thrown their toddlers dirty diapers in the hall. Not worth it to stay at this property. Go elsewhere!
30,many room issues (non-smoking room with smoke odor and a TV that remained unfixed after two nights of efforts) put a damper on what should have been a fun trip. the front desk staff did their best to resolve this without success.
30,The pyramid hasn’t made any substantial upgrades to bring it into the 2020’s generation. Simple things like HDTV’s and USB ports to charge electronics are standard today but absent from this hotel. It’s definitely time for some upgrades!    Lastly good luck with the elevators. Panels are falling off and even some of the doors shake as you traverse the floors.
20,Stayed one night seemed like they were so rushed to putting people in rooms that’s cleanliness was last thing on their mind. How can this happen during these times? Id rather wait for a clean room that being told rooms are ready when they aren’t clean!
10,The staff was rude and very unorganized. There was roaches in my room and they wouldn’t accommodate me with a new room the halls are loud at every hour the TV DID NOT WORK and lights keep flickering sometimes not turn on. Never will I stay here or recommend anyone else todo so…
50,Stayed in East Tower. Rooms were larger with a large tv. The beds were really comfortable. It takes a while to get to the room. If your in the east tower coming from the shops at Mandalay Bay you can get to your room quicker by turning left beside the escalators. I would definitely stay again
40,There are a lot of places to eat lots of entertainment and is connected to two other casinos so you don't have to go outside to visit more shops and eating places. It is farther down the strip than other locations but it still is not too far from other major casinos.
50,Staff was professional and courteous. Rooms were clean and spacious. The hotel was beautiful with lots of activities. The pool area was nice and relaxing. The hotel is in a great location on the strip.
50,The staff was very friendly and even upgraded our room complimentary. The room was very nice and well kept. I plan on staying here many more times in the future. Thank you for a great visit and first impression.
10,Outdated  Uncomfortable beds.  Noisy children running in halls.  Not enough food court options  Lacking in Egyptian theme  Unreasonable parking  Unleashed dog running loose near elevator.    Unclean room. Items found from previous guest.    A 3 star hotel at best.
50,The room was beautiful the prices for food were very expensive. I would definitely go again. The hotel is exactly as advertised. I love Egyptian everything that’s one of the main reasons I picked this specific hotel
10,The room was dirty  Sheet were stained  Water pressure low I think all rooms should be checked and cleaned well the sheets should never be stained that was not good i hope they can fix the problem in the hotel
50,Wife and I decided for our 35th anniversary we would go to Vegas we stayed at the Luxor. Spa was very relaxing and the food was plentiful. Did a lot of walking saw some great show (Mad Apple is a must-see) We also learned the benefits of MGM Rewards.
40,Great location and prices for clean rooms! The only negative deal with Luxor are the elevators. They take a long time crowds form and the elevators themselves are bit dodgy. Other than that the place is great!
30,Rooms did not have any refrigerators  we had to buy cold water everyday at $5.00-$6.00 a piece cost us alot for 5 days. Also there were no microwaves in the room. For the price you pay for food would have been nice to heat up leftovers. Also no shade or umbrellas by the pool unless you want to rent a very expensive cabana its to hot not to have shade. Spoke to service once for quick questions she was very short and pretty much hung up the phone before i said thank you. Rooms also need some updates.
50,Go play blackjack and take all the money you win and buy extra nights in Vegas. Always hit a soft 17 and double on 11. If someone splits 10s leave the table they are probably a casino worker trying to rat you
30,Rooms are clean and very very basic. No complimentary water bottle no USB connection and no coffee.  Location was convenient and walking distance to where we were going.  Some of the room decor was aged and could use a lift.
50,Nice hotel nice rooms not over crowded nice rewards good food rooms were fresh casino well maintained the bars are nice and well maintained also. Hotel is at the beginning of the strip and the pyramid rooms give a nice view of everything down stairs
10,If i had an option to rate 0 believe me i would. The front desk was absolutely no help. They ask for extra fee for early check in but they dont give u a room until after check in time.  They made me wonder around the hotel with 2 little kids for over 6 hours.  Ive been to vegas over 20 times and this was my first time staying in luxor and i had the worst experience. I will never recommend luxor to anyone.  My cousin had a room for next month at luxor but she canceled her reservation after heard what happened to me.
20,The stench in the self parking garage by the first floor elevator was awful. I had to hold my breath while paying $18 dollar at the SELF PARKING ticket machine because the area smelled of urine. There was trash and car oil spilled on the ground as I tried to maneuver my luggage around the debris & spills to get to my car.
50,The two days I spent there was absolutely amazing staff was amazing in every area just a bit expensive for the quality of the food and the shops but the Luxor was amazing! This was an amazing second time at this great hotel any veteran bring themselves friends or family should definitely only stay here or in at MGM hotel the staff again amazing food a little overpriced but military discount and very exceptional service they’re fast sweet caring and understanding and that’s what you look for hospitality and customer service.
50,We had a great time at the Luxor! From the front desk to the bell desk from checkin to checkout and everything in between was amazing. We saw a show Carrot Top in the hotel and had a great time. The restaurants were great and all the staff were very nice!
40,My family stayed on the 15th floor at the tour. The room was clean and very quiet. We had a nice sleep. We had a beautiful view of the Allegiant stadium and also the pool. The buffet was good however we spent over 30min in line waiting for the made to order omelette. Once we returned to our table to have our first meal there was already other people seating at our table. The server thought that we had left since we took too long. We were then moved to a different table.
10,From the check in valet to the check out procedure. Horrible. Luxor has turned into a giant Walmart. No customer satisfaction rude staff mediocre rooms. The sink and tub would not drain. No one picked up the front desk phone. I couldn’t get a hold of anyone. Will never go here again.
50,Always excellent service from everyone at Luxor from the valet to the bell service and security always helpful in general mgm resorts is always my first option definitely recommend to anyone coming to Vegas.
40,The Luxor is an older property. However they have kept the rooms updated. Also the rooms were clean. So I highly recommend the Luxor over the budget hotels in the area. Just spend a little extra and enjoy the quality of the Luxor rooms. Also Luxor is in a convenient location in the center between all the MGM properties. It is easy to visit the surrounding MGM properties by internal connecting bridges or the monorail train. Of course the Luxor is an older property so if you are looking for a top class room (for example if you are on your honeymoon) then maybe look at the more expensive hotels for top class rooms. But for just a regular fun nigh in Vegas the Luxor is a perfect choice. Also I recommend getting a room with a deep soaking bathtub. A lot of the rooms have a shower only. The Luxor soaking bathtub is a nice reward after a long airplane trip and waiting in line at the Rental Car center
50,No necesitas ir afuera todo esta adentro del hotel restaurantes piscina todo en un solo lugar. I love this hotel and next time in Vegas I will book again. Thank you for hospitality and help. We really love it!
50,I liked everything. Nice hotel. Wonderful pool. Delicious cocktails. The staff is polite answers any questions. I would like more restaurants with European cuisine. And that they work 24 hours. The hotel is clean cheap. Excellent location.
10,From the shower not working to the sink clogging shower fills while taking a shower when you can actually get the water working. The valet is a joke and waste of money they stand around while you get your own vehicle. They will apply upgrades to your account without approval so watch your bills people.
40,Many activities on the property and beautiful pools. Mezzanine area has great food and plenty of variety. Rooms can use updating but very comfortable. You don’t really spend any time in your room anyway
30,This was my husband and I's first time staying at the Luxor and we were really underwhelmed. We definitely booked our room at a pretty low price but received low quality in return. Our room was not very clean when we arrived. There were blood stains on the pillowcase and some kind of pasta sauce on the door frames. Both the sink and the showers backed up when we used them. The elevator closest to our room was broken for our entire stay which was very inconvenient when hauling luggage in and out or after a long day of walking. I love the theme of this place but was really expecting better quality from MGM.
50,This is our 2nd time staying here and it was just as great as the last visit. Quick and easy check in reasonable resort fees and a super friendly and helpful staff. Highly recommended and worth a visit for sure!!
10,Must be in shape to be here. Very long distance between valet to front desk even further to elevators. Each floor a labyrinth with no signage. Previous guest leftovers in fridge. In room coffee service empty. No cups and only 1 decaf packet remaining. Even after calling never refilled. Valet parking for guest no longer included. All Resturant’s close at 2 or 3 in the afternoon including buffet. Only option for dinner is a Mexican cantina with up to 50-60 min wait or fast food.
50,We last visited the Luxor Hotel in 2019. We were a little skeptical of staying there again during the summer time. Last time we stayed in the pyramid the hallways smelled and the air could not keep up with heat.    We went ahead and booked in the pyramid again. We had a premier king room on the 5th floor. The room stayed cool the whole week-even in the 112 temperature. Our room was cleaned every day around 10. The housekeeper did an amazing job of keeping our room clean and refreshed with towels every day.    We ate at two of the restaurants: Public House and Diablos. Both restaurants were better than any other of the restaurants we ate on the trip.    We used the online check in while we were waiting on the shuttle at the airport. It was a smooth process. It was nice to arrive at the hotel walk to a tablet to scan our code and get our room keys. We saw the line at check in and we did not wait at all. It was a great process.    Overall we were very pleased with this hotel. The only thing we were not pleased with was the Buffet. We used to enjoy the Buffet at Luxor. It had very few offerings at breakfast. We felt like it was over priced for the quality of the food and the offerings.
40,I wouldn't recommend Vegas in July. The surface of the sun might've been a cooler destination. However it was fun and staying on the strip is essential. The Luxor pool was wonderful Blue Man Group rocked.
40,I called the hotel directly and got a better price than what was quoted online (Expedia). The rooms were a little far away from the front desk but this is a massive hotel with 2000 rooms. I had a good experience here my room was nice staff was very friendly… I would definitely stay here again!
20,I will say this place is truly going down hill. In all my years of coming here it just keeps going down the drains and it seems as if employees could give 2 damns. We have always stayed at the Luxor but I think it’s time to go elsewhere. Even my siblings who come about 3-4xs a year and are platinum members agree.
10,Room was not thorough stains everywhere. Didn’t get any money back so I was trapped. No free nothing. It does make since you take the way they do with such a low quality facility. My stay was horrible. Pool even closes before dark. 6pm They need to upgrade everything. Everything
20,The check in line was super long and slow(remind me of going through customs) for starters. When we finally got to the room it was hot(we had the air set as low as it would go and it never got cool in the room) and the room are very dated nothing like the pictures the bed was almost on the floor. We couldn't go anywhere in the Luxor without someone trying to push Timeshares on us which I hated. I would not recommend this hotel or stay here again waist of time and money.
50,Family members and cousins traveled to celebrate a birthday. Traveled from South and East Coast. Enjoyed Supper club show with dinner visiting other family members and sightseeing. Enjoyed easy access to shops.
20,Birthday trip wasn’t the best phone service wasn’t working in the hotel only if you was outside. No room services  No microwave no refrigerator. I will never return only if it FREE? Maybe if I can come back again to see if all the things was changed then maybe but for my first time being there I will never come back. First impression is the thing that sticks with you and this wasn’t that GREAT
10,The reason it was a 1 because our checking in and checking out process was unprofessional. The lady checking us in had a attitude. We called the front desk to extend our check out time till 3pm which they agreed but when we came to our rooms at 2:00pm to receive our luggage our keys were disabled and it took almost an hour to reach someone. Once we did they sent security over but it took a min as well but the security was really nice and apologized and said they usually do guest like this checking out. One of the maids bust in our other room while we were in there changing before 3 saying it wasn’t up to the front desk to extend the time because she has to clean the room. I was not satisfied with my experience.
10,The room and bathroom were filthy. The bed had brown stains on multiple sections. It's easily the longest check-in I've ever been forced to endure. I will never voluntarily step foot on this awful establishment another day in my life.
20,My room was hot even with the AC at full blast it had a funny smell. My sheets had black spots. I wouldn’t stay here again took forever to check in. Not very clean they didn’t do anything about the AC so I stayed in a hot room
20,Was charged a day for the room and wasn't even able to use it because of my flight being cancelled and rescheduled due to unexpected storm that happened in Las Vegas. No type of compensation was offered. Housekeeping was called numerous times for not fully stocking toiletries during initial clean up visits. Housekeeping was actually called my first actual night that I stayed because they had not cleaned my room all day while I was away.
50,I hadn't been to the Luxor in many year's it has changed. But I had a very good experience there the staff was friendly and the hotel met all my needs so I appreciate that would I go back yes and would I recommend this hotel yes I would
10,Waited 60-minutes to check in. Upcharged for downgraded room in order to check in early. Mold in bathroom. Sticky carpets. No amenities not even an iron but paid resort fees for amenities. Expected me to wait another 60-minutes in line to deal with issues. Paid for 3-nights but only stayed one because of dissatisfaction. No compromise feeling scammed waste of money.
40,I’ve stayed at this location multiple times and recommend staying in the tower. A lot of the pyramid rooms are older. Recommend bring personal water bottles and request a refrigerator for your room to keep stuff cold. They do not offers microwaves. So if you bring food back to your room expect to eat it cold. The buffet is reasonably priced and if your a veteran you receive a discount there and a few other items places. Room was clean towels were clean and bed comfortable. That’s covered all the basics for me. It’s Vegas!!! Who stays in the room all day there???
20,Too many unexpected charges and property not maintained. Staff was short staffed too much crowds and long lines.  Not clearly provided directions. Parking was blocked to enter and had to park to MGM. Long walk in a very hot day from MGM parking to luxure
10,Pyramid room had cockroaches everywhere when you turn the lights on 1br suite had crickets could sleep. The room situation was very disappointing considering I had 3 rooms. Didn’t ask much other then to switch rooms because it was gross.
20,Casino shows its age and looks old and dirty rooms are average to below with dirty floors. pool was ok a poor value would give 2 stars . long lines and few kiosk in casino. our family will not stay at Luxor again
20,Booked the Luxor due to the proximity to the Allegiant stadium. Was very convenient but found the hotel to be past its prime. The staff were on the whole unfriendly and unwilling to help as if a paying customer was an inconvenience. We booked a stay well room which promised to have extra filtration and have feel of a spa stay but the room smelt of cigarettes (as did whole hotel) and felt old and jaded. We had maintenance issues with air conditioning and room couldn’t cool down. We asked for someone to come look at it and they just sent up a fan with housekeeping and then someone called 12 hours later 20 minutes before checkout to see if we wanted them to take a look! We told them to fix after we left. On departure we called down for baggage to send up a cart and were told it would be 45 minutes minimum as they had over 5000 rooms and we were just one of them - we decided to take it down ourselves and just get out of there. Overall would not choose to stay here ever again
10,The casino itself is nice. But the rooms are dirty. The air conditioning wasn't working I called front desk they said they would send someone to look at it but they never showed up. There was poop stains in toilet everything was gross
50,I had a good time but they need to do better with the rooms. The overall hotel was nice. The food in the restaurant was good. Enjoyed playing the slots and it was nice meeting and talking to other pe.
50,I loved my stay at Luxor! was extremely pleased with housekeeping they are doing a good job! My room was reasonably priced and I was happy with how many food options there are in and around the property. I will be staying again very soon!
30,Extremely comfortable beds and pillows. No mini fridge in initial room and had to upgrade. No coffee pot. Most hallways smelled like pot and leaked smell into my room. Back hallway 4B was very secluded and scary.
30,This Casino was hard to stay in at the machine because of the cigarette smoke there was an incident and no information on what happened. They acted like nothing ever happened we had to walk around the whole casino to the front of the entrance on the outside because the way we came was locked down
20,Horrible experience with the bathroom so disgusting taking a shower there!!! Room rate was great but we would pay more without a doubt for a basic clean bathroom I mean how they can charge for a room that doesn’t have a basic sanitary condition!!!
50,Great hotel. I loved the facility. The staff was wonderful and accommodating! The food was good. Plenty of things to do (gamble shows nightlife) all in one facility. I had a great experience and will be back!
20,Complained about shower not draining and no one was sent to fix . We each had to wait about an hour for the next person to shower. Not acceptable especially when we had tickets to be somewhere . Just don’t understand how that is not an issue they cared to help us with.
50,We had an awesome experience again at the Luxor Resort. We look forward to staying there again. The rooms are always nice and the staff is very friendly and helpful. This was our 3rd or 4th time staying at this resort and we’ve never had a bad experience.
10,I’m a 5 month pregnant women. Who got hurt there was an alarming shooter employees where furious we where trying to hide for our safety !!!! I got hurt packed my things and left that same night!! Besides this dirty rooms cigarette buds all over the room hallways! We where told our room number was 045 twice by receptionist 45 minutes trying to look for our room turns out security said that room did not existed turns out it was 1045!!!! Do not book here !!!!!
10,This place is trash. AC didn’t work plumbing was crap (it smelled like sewage) and the pool was dirty. I will never stay here again. So many other places that are way better. Almost forgot elevators were way too busy
50,Excellent price and great stay! I had my doubts due to some reviews but it was perfect. If you don’t feel like going out you can have a blast at their casino and bars! Don’t hesitate to book a stay here!
50,We have recently visited Las Vegas. It was a great first experience. We really loved it and will be going back. Luxor customer service was great. Since it was our first time in Vegas they were really helpful.
40,Enjoyed the stay at Luxor Hotel & Casino. They have a digital check in and check out that we really liked. This allowed us to avoid the long lines and head straight to the room. We were also allowed to digitally check out. So if you want to avoid the lines get the App.
40,I've stayed here multiple times and have always been satisfied with my stay. One thing I really can't stand is how loud the music is in the lobby/casino area 24/7. Given the layout of the hotel all rooms face the casino and while I understand is Vegas I feel the hotel can lower the volume of the music at night. During our recent stay there was some alarm that was triggered the alarm went off for way longer than it should have specially after they deemed it to be a false alarm that announcement went for way too long too.    I did love the new self-check in option to do it through the app that process was so quick! Great job implementing new security measures for elevator you are only allowed to go to the floor your room is located.
50,Love the Luxor. The staff is excellent. Great food at Diablo's and Public House. The only issue we had was the elevator right outside our room wasn't working so we had lots of walking. Rooms are clean and they brought extra pillows when we asked. Will be going back again next summer.
50,Convenient and nice room. Very convenient to my conference at the Mandalin Bay. We stayed in the north tower and the room was very nice. Wish we had a mini refrigerator though. The MGM tram was very easy to use also and helped making out way through the strip without the need for a taxi all the time.
10,I will never stay at this property again. The room had no refrigerator and almost no amenities—not even a closet—and the paint furnishings were outdated. My phone charging cord kept falling out of the defective wall outlet. The app-based room key and parking garage access worked only some of the time. I changed my travel plans to leave a day early the hotel was such a dump.
10,Could not contact front desk from my room multiple problems with our room. Broken glass shower door that fell. ( never fixed ) elevator did not work upon arrival how do use the stairs multiple times elevator unsafe.
30,The location and amenities were nice. The elevators were so scary though. We also didn't have a shower door for some reason. We had family staying on the other side and the rooms seemed very inconsistent. Our room stayed mostly cool but theirs was ridiculously hot.
10,First room air and tv didn't work. Called front desk said they would send someone to come look at it. After 2 1/2hrs went to the front desk.Gave us a second room where the air conditioner barley work. Temperature never dropped Below 78 degrees
40,We chose the Luxor to be close to the t mobile arena for a concert the team took us right there and we were able to easily walk back. The rooms are renovated and have a good feel. The elevator situation is a small mess but worth the wait because the price is very competitive.
30,Overall good experience friendly staff. Dated hotel but upgraded room however ac was being replaced and no notice was given room was 87degrees. Unable to be in room for more than a few minutes at a time.
40,"Hadn't stayed at the Luxor in 20 years and not much has changed. I do like the theme though and the staff is kind. However they need to do better at the cashier cage. I shouldn't have to wait 10 minutes when only one person is helping and THREE others are engaged in ""busy work"" while customers wait."
50,We had a great experience at Luxor. The energy was great staff very good helpful and friendly. Felt safe the entire time. The hotel has some wear and tear on it but overall it is clean. There are some good choices for eating and drinking.
40,My brother mom and nieces (10 and 11) stayed for 2 nights in the west tower. Rooms were clean bed super comfy and great shower pressure. Could do with a mini fridge and microwave. Casino and hotel was clean. Pool nice kid friendly (if you don't mind seeing butt cheeks;) ) One suggestion have am arcade or something for kids! Maybe pool open for families only 7 to 9 pm. All in all excited to come back and see some Luxor Exhibits.
30,I wish there were more free amenities such as a fridge and/or coffee machine - forced to pay for resort fees and was not in my budget to spend money on a service I wasn't going to use. Bathroom shower clogged on first use.
50,First time in Vegas and decided to stay on the strip at the only Hotel I knew of. Ended up also being one of the cheaper options but punched well above its weight on the quality of the room stuff and overall experience. Not the glitziest Vegas resort experience but one I’m glad I stayed at and would happily stay at again.
50,Had a wonderful trip didn’t win a darn thing in the casino 😁. There was so much to do for entertainment after couple of days you move on from the gambling. I wish the Casinos in Vegas would do away with smoking or give them there own closed in area to play and smoke.The smoke got to me so I guess I can thank the smokers for saving me money. Loved loved my one bedroom suite. It had a fridge wet bar and coffee pot. Separate living room area. Made our 6 day stay pleasant.
30,The rooms were average no fridge. The bathroom shower didn’t have a closing door or curtain so the bathroom floor got wet every time you showered. Pool closes early and not many restaurants or attractions at this hotel. Public house restaurant was good though.
30,They need to totally rehab the rooms ..the room had stale almost mildew smell to it…the deco was lack luster and dated…it’s just a room to sleep in& not hang out and in &enjoy….The old Bed Bible and a bath 😂
10,This hotel is dark and uninviting. No Coffee maker fridge microwave should be expected. If you want a fridge...you'll have to pay for it. Getting lost in the hallways is common because they are dark and have little signage.
30,The type of people staying at this hotel was sketchy at best. The mobile check-in would be an awesome feature if they actually gave directions on how to use it. The app makes you believe that you have checked in completely until you go  to use the elevators. Directions to the different towers were vague. Hotel room tub had hair in it that wasn’t ours so it made me question the overall cleanliness of the room.
50,Employees are top notch. They understand what it takes to be success for in the service industry. The location is good you have to do a little traveling to get to the other properties but worth it. I went to several MGM properties this one was full of energy but not overly crowded. Friday night there was a DJ in the casino people were genuinely have a great time singing and dancing throughout the entire floor. So fun to see and participate in. The material things (rooms etc) are never going to be perfect but delivering a good vibe and social experiences brings very high marks in my opinion.
10,Worst hotel. Rooms filthy. Tv doesn’t work air shut off. Employees are stalkers 15-20 minutes to get an elevator. Then when we got to an elevator a gentleman told us he had the same problems. I have pics of mold. Mold in the shower
20,There is no microwave or fridges in the rooms for storing cold water. Also paying for parking was extremely annoying every time you left the hotel to explore other parts of Vegas especially when hotels like the Venetian and Treasure Island had free parking.
20,The resort fee is almost as much as Mandalay Bay but at Luxor you have no clue what that fee is paying for. You have to rent a fridge and microwave if you want it so unless you want to pay another daily fee forget about eating your left overs. They were doing construction and instead of just telling us about it we were woken up by it. Half their elevators were broken down so we had to walk across the entire hotel to get anywhere at least we got our steps in but it’s also something they failed to mention at check in.
50,Great location lots to do in and around the hotel. If you are looking for a casino the Luxor is the place. Plenty of bars and restaurants to choose from. If you are into gaming Luxor offers you a place for that HyperX Arena!
50,I was given a suite {room 1101} without requesting it! My son couldn't join me this time due to national debate  schedule but will join me on the next visit. We're considering late August this time around.
50,My stay at the Luxor this summer was great as always. I stared staying at this hotel for the convenience close to freeway and mist of the places I frequent while in Vegas. The staff is helpful and the rooms super clean.
40,"Overall good experience. Luxor is a good value for the money. But we did experience a few problems. 1) blaring long-lasting alarms went off twice during our short stay caused by ""minor issues"". 2) treacherous shower floor 3) non-working vending machine and ice machine. (this issue was reported but got no service -- the Luxor front desk said it wasn't their responsibility to fix)"
50,We celebrated our 17th anniversary. It was one of the greatest experiences visiting Las Vegas for the first time. We will visit again for our 20th Anniversary. Luxor Hotel was close to everything. Less than $15 of Uber to anywhere you want to go.
10,What the heck !!!    When I purchased my room I never read anything that said it would be another 140$$ in resort fees!!! So wrong and unprofessional to tell a customer it will be one cost and then find out later it was a Lie. I mean absolute LIE! Will never recommend your services and make sure friends and family never stay at an MGM tesort
20,At time of check in they assignme a lower floor ; I requested to be relocated to a higher floor they mention my view was beautiful . And was the worst all blocked bun concreto beams even mine. Was a two bedroom suite
20,Room was ok. Room number outside was written in pen on the wall. Rooms on either side had the actual sign with the room number. Wallpaper outside of our room was ripped in multiple places. Someone had entered our room while we were out at dinner turned on the shower threw a towel on the floor and made many dirty footprints with their shoes. Security stated they could not share results of investigation. Nothing appears to be missing however much sleep was lost wondering who else might have had access to our room.
30,Although a bathroom may not be your first thought when choosing a hotel a poor one can ruin a stay. There is no way to keep water from getting all over the floor with the half door open design. The toilet flush is SO loud. If I'm thinking of staying in Las Vegas I can't get past these issues at the Luxor. The positives friendly staff and helpful concierge. Bag check was easy and the staff there polite. The beds and pillows are comfortable. My kids were not impressed with the slanted wall. Oh well I tried. There are 3 different pools which is nice. Rent a cabana if you plan on staying out there.
20,This was tge worst experience we have ever had in las vegas. Hotel rooms are dirty. Dirty hallways. Terrible food. Never staying there again. After my wife got Injured by one of the umbrellas from the pool she never got checked up on or got fairly compensated
50,Absolutely love the resort (didn't win squat) from the pool area to self check in to the room/beds to luggage assistance to the restaurants/shops/shows to the tram! Loved all of it well worth the wait!!
30,Everything in our room was on the fritz which meant continual calls to the front desk. The safe the AC even the electricity in the bathroom. Very sad not sure we would stay again. The staff seemed irritated every time we called with another problem and several guests staying in the pyramid were also changing rooms which indicates issues in the general area we were staying in.
20,Pool was great. Life guards were awesome  My kids were asking why the room was dirty family wasn’t happy overall with the room asked to upgrade and was quickly turned down. Definitely not what I wanted on this vacation
30,It was not great just ok thank you though I don’t want to write 200 characters but here we are not much to say it’s the Luxor too many kids basically off strip over priced mediocre visit not a lot of effort but you get what you pay for
10,Had a terrible experience with the AC the inclinator card readers don’t work digital keys convenient but don’t always work no refrigerator coffee or microwave my daughter’s got stuck trying to get from floor to floor
10,My week’s stay was not a positive thing. Customer service was awful. My room was half cleaned. My door wouldn’t shut properly. The elevators were nasty everyday and sometimes the key wouldn’t work. They nickel and dime everything
30,It's one of the cheaper options on the strip and it's fine nothing awful nothing great. No shade at the pool. Honestly in my own humble opion I'd say skip vegas and go somewhere else but if you're determined to go to vegas the luxor is fine
10,Dark hotel dark room no information about the hotel could not locate a manager could not find anyone to assist with information about the hotel could not someone to help with changing my room due to my disability.
50,Great atmosphere tons of things to do great food. You never really need to leave the hotel! We have been to Luxor before and we're happy so we returned. Still happy and positive we won't stay anywhere else while in vegas.
50,Nice rooms at a fair cost. Staff is friendly although check in needs to be more efficient. Can definitely see myself staying here again. It is a bit far from the action in the middle of the strip but everything is walking distance. If you’re going for simple and clean this is your hotel.
20,The AC was not working in our room. They said it would be several hours before it could be looked at. Staff did not offer a solution we asked for a fan and it took over an hour to arrive. Spent a miserable night in a sauna.
10,First the staff here was amazing. Beyond that … If you want a cheap room to sleep off non-stop smoking and gambling this place is for you; otherwise try elsewhere. We joked about following the blood splatters on the floor near the elevator (likely spilled drink that was never cleaned). One also can’t beat the disgusting smell of the hotel (great for vomiting up that alcohol). For us it was a cheap stop in case our flight was delayed before we left for a road trip so that if we lost out on a night it was only a few bucks. We couldn’t wait to leave.
40,Even though I had problems checking in with my digital key the over all stay was very nice and relaxing room was nice and location was very quiet the housekeeping staff didn’t really speak but bedside that everything else’s was great
10,Filthy dirty nasty from the hallway to the rooms! Nastiest hotel ever. I had to cancel and try and find somewhere else to stay bc it was NASTY! Upon my trips to the front desk other were also complaining of their rooms being filthy. Manager did not ensure a clean room. Offer food credit. WORST EXPERIENCE EVER!!
10,The room was warm all the time. The bathroom had a foul odor all the time. Beds were extremely uncomfortable. For a three night stay room was cleaned once. Hallways always smelled like marijuana and we were overcharged on the parking. Check in and check out were awful experiences long lines and not enough staff durng peak period.
30,No fridge no microwave. For how expensive the restaurants are i would hope microwaves would be in room. Bathroom tub slippery and moldy at door rails. Carpet was wet in spots and needed vacuuming. The cantina food was GREAT. The cafe food was alright.
50,The Luxor hotel is an amazing luxury hotel which is very affordable. Check-in and check out process was smooth ( everything done via app). The location was perfect and the hotel and casino have so many shows and games to choose from.
50,The hotel is very clean. Staff is friendly & provided extra towels per request without hesitation. Great food options. Fun arcade place for kids. Great distance to shows and stores on the strip. Recommend!
40,Good price and the location was key. However the room was not completely clean. There were hairs in the wall of the shower right at eye level so I'm not sure of the cleanliness of the shower or toilet at that point. The shower was somewhat clogged. There was also an empty water bottle next to the chair.
50,Rooms were very clean bathroom and shower spotless!! Environment really cool and stuff was really kind and helpful!! I would definitely recommend the Luxor to friends and family! We also really enjoyed the pool area!!
50,Happy happy family fun definitely going back I also sighed up players reward hoping to get some free family trips I don't wanna stay at any other resort just luxor blue man group and the pools qnd hyper x was dope
50,Great resort to stay with family awesome pool very clean and awesome services.Everything inside was beautiful and many great food choices. Definitely recommend staying here easy access to other resorts.
40,Stayed at a tower room. The rooms was nice and clean. Staff friendly and helpful. Would it be happier if they had an in-room coffee machine and small fridge but overall it was a good resort to stay.
20,Pool closes at 6 pm. Room keys never worked. Had to go to registration which is across the property 6 times to get new keys. The room shower didn’t drain and air was broken at check in. Staff was rude when we asked questions. Don’t think we should have to pay resort fees when the “resort” closes at 6
50,Great experience we need more time to know and enjoy the hotel! 👍👍🙌 really good food I think the restaurants and Yogurt ice cream shop clouse to early during the week I’ll like to recognize the housekeepers service! Very kind
30,When I arrived the floor to my room was dirty(I had to clean it myself). The TV did not work my entire stay. Someone finally came on my last night after multiple calls to the front counter and room service.
30,To many things happen little issues if they resolve on time everything would have been different  I was check in at 4:00 because I have meetings at 6:00 and 9:00  I lost both …my family was there with me show ticket on the trash
50,One of my most favorite places in Las Vegas. Classic but still luxury. Updated and very clean. Great restaurants and great gaming. The pool is excellent not overwhelmed with people. If you want a standard food court they have it all.
50,My family and I went to Luxor hotel in the endings of June 2022. All I can say is that I enjoyed my every moment while my stay there. The desk lady was so kind and very professional. And our rooms were cleaned daily. We will definitely return!
50,Very clean. The staff was very helpful and friendly. Very accommodating. Answered all of our questions. The room was clean. We loved our time there. Will definitely come back.
40,We had a great time our room was very nice and comfortable. The housekeeping staff was amazing. The pool need to stay open longer if there is anything that I would complain about the Luxor corner suites is where I will be.
50,I always wanted to stay in this hotel due to a keen passion for Ancient Egypt. The décor was out of this world. Every other aspect of the hotel was great. I felt like I was in a paradise. Definitely gonna stay here again.
50,Accommodations were excellent. Not much more to say about that we were only there two nights. Staff were also friendly and extremely helpful. The food was just OK We ate at the Tender Steak - the steak was not tender but rather tough and stringy. The prices were very high for the quality of the meat.
50,Fun trip to see family and old friends the Luxor was awesome. My suite was very nice bed was fantastic. The brunch buffet very good and the other restaurants great meals were had every night. Can't wait to do it again.
50,The amenities provided at the property satisfied our needs for and makes a perfect getaway. We enjoyed the shows as well as dining at Luxor and nearby MGM restaurants. Staff are very helpful and very informative.
50,The Luxor hotel is definitely worth considering yes it is at the end of the strip but worth the stay. The tower suites are clean and spacious. The pool area is large and has several pools so you are not on top of each other and there is tons of sunlight due to no surrounding buildings.  Yes I would stay here again.
50,First time staying in the tower suite and enjoyed it very much so did my friends. Will definitely return again to the Luxor and looking forward to it. Also enjoyed Tender Steakhouse and as always the good was great
50,We had a great stay for our 10th wedding anniversary. Room was clean staff was attentive. The only downside is how early the pool closes. After a long day out on the strip an evening swim would be refreshing. Overall would definitely stay again.
50,This is the second time I’ve stayed at the Luxor Hotel and Casiono and both times I have stayed here I have only great things to say about Luxor! Awesome experience and super friendly staff! NO GHOSTS like people say all the time!
20,My husband and I spent our anniversary here and we did not enjoy the hotel. The check in process was the first thing: they wanted to charge $200 plus the resort fee(was aware of this) but not the $200 then when I complained about it she lowered it to $50 for the incidental deposit.    Next the elevator was not working properly. Whenever you scan your card and press the floor if the next person scans their card it will erase your floor. So if you didn’t rescan your card in time you will have to ride the elevator to the top and come back down. This happened to multiple people on multiple occasions during our trip.    Also we were never offered any deals coupons slot play comps show information…NOTHING. I had better service in Atlantic City.    Lastly this hotel is too far down the strip.    The room was nice but it didn’t have a refrigerator (you had to pay for that)    The only thing I enjoyed was going to the Titanic show.    We won’t be back at this resort.
40,Room was good online booking and checking was good. Did Gita l key was a little troublesome but finally worked okay. Good variety of gaming machines restaurants and entertainment venues. Will go again.
40,Had a great time there other than something around the hotel was high like $8.00 for water but other than that you will enjoy your stay and enjoy yourself in the casino. Staff is friendly and there’s something to do around your hold stay.
50,As usual I really enjoyed my stay at the Luxor.The staff is friendly the rooms are very nice and I like the location.There is a convenient Tram connecting the LuxorExcalibre and Mandalay Bay.I wish they built a new buffet on the main floor with a sunroof and quality food instead of the current one.
10,Poor customer service nickel and dime you for everything rude management team air conditioning does not work must rent mini fridge and coffee maker buffets are closed on mondays and Tuesday and are only open from 8-3pm. Pool closes at 6pm and will close at anytime per staff discretion. Rooms are first come first serve even with a reservation front desk will blame you if you check in late even if it’s on file you will be check in late.
10,The Luxor is in grave need of a facelift within the bedrooms and shower areas.    Our shower would not fully turn off the beauty mirror was broken as were other lamps within the main bedroom area.    The carpeting was soiled in various places and when toilet paper or towels were requested Via personal phone call to the concierge that was also a no-go.    The daily “hidden charges” experienced by the common-folk staying at the Luxor are absolutely uncalled for!    We all know that Covid hit Vegas very hard…    But that should not mean that paying & returning customers should have to pay even more to make up for these losses.    There is a $15 per day parking fee plus a $30 per day fee for just staying at the hotel… Really.  Plus the room-card that you receive to acquire entrance and exit of the parking garage never seems to work!    So you have to wait for someone to help you to get into the parking garage as well as exiting the parking garage plus the hidden $15 per day to use their parking garage….Really?    Pretty sloppy for the Luxor…and not ok for the regular paying JoeBlow like us.
10,There are plenty of MGM Hotels to choose from don’t let the Luxor be one of them. I don’t think I’ll stay with them going forward and will always go with Excalibur or New York New York. At least there I’ll get my investments worth.
40,Hotel was really nice. I will be a returning guest. You wIll need a taxi or rental car to get around the Luxor is not located near the center of the strip.. The Cafe had really great food and the food court upstairs is open pretty late. However the pool did close very early for it to be summer time at 6 pm not only at the Luxor but at most hotels.
50,Rooms are spacious and clean. However everything is quite expensive. Bottled water was $5.69 which is ridiculous. A bottle of soda $4.40. 16oz. At least 3 Starbucks in the lobby and other restaurants that also pricey. But Las Vegas has always been pricey so be prepared.
40,I stayed one night at the Luxor with my daughter on a last minute short trip into Vegas. The front desk tried to give me an updated room in the tower but my kid was so excited about staying in the actual pyramid that we declined. Even though the common areas and hallways had some visible wear the room itself was clean and quite decent. It was clean the beds were actually some of the most comfortable hotel beds I’ve slept on we did not have any issues with noise and we enjoyed the view of the sunset over the mountains facing the pool area side.
20,Nothing was great about this hotel except the price of the room. Service was terrible- from the pool to casino floor people are just doing their job. Took hours at the pool to order wine- with a cabana and two waitresses ??  Not a positive experience. Room was clean.
30,The air conditioner kept turning off. I would wake up sweating and turn it on and I would wake up sweating again to discover the air was off again. It was very uncomfortable to sleep in this room. I had 4 rooms rented and 3 out of 4 had problems with the air conditioner
50,It's always a pleasure staying here Luxor is always our first choice the staff is really nice and helpful. Plus the pricing is great for your wallet. The pool area is always lit and the tables to gamble are cheap compared to other hotels.
50,Clean room nice staff excellent pool!! Fun time at casino loved Egyptian theme! Checkin lines were long but it was Friday afternoon. Taxis were always on standby tram was great! Will definitely come back!
30,Pass this hotel was okay. I would not book again as the cleanliness and smell was unacceptable. This hotel was in a pretty good location and there is plenty to do but the quality of the room truly left a memorable experience and not in a good way
40,I love the luxor but be advised the digital keys for hotel room and elevator can be extremely faulty at times. Other than that it’s really nice. Awesome shows there too. I got to see the blue man group wow! That was an amazing experience.
50,The room was up to date and very clean. I would recommend staying here as it's at a great location. I like that it's at the start of the strip and it has a free train that will take you further down the strip.
30,Shower head was waist high handheld no tub or even a small wall to keep the water from spilling out of the shower no drain in the bathroom to clean up the mess that was inevitably made had to clean it all up with towels. The light over the sink was out. The AC wouldn't cool the room. We set it as low as it would go after slowly setting it lower and lower and the room stayed at 76 the entire day.
10,The AC was not working in the 2 bedroom suite that I stayed in. Three calls were made to housekeeping and no resolution was arrived. All we got was a fan to place in the living room and circulate hot air around the suite. It was a very hot night.
10,we had mold in one of our rooms it was switched twice our suite had a non working light in the shower missing remote for the tv vent full of dust and they manager after i came down like 4 or 5 times for these issues told me we can cancel your reservation and you can stay somewhere else
20,Run down  Poor amenities: no fridge no complimentary coffee.  Not clean trash overflowing  Elevators were broken and rickety.  Pool was murky and closed at 6pm.  Smoke smell everywhere you went including rooms.
20,Room wasn’t clean with hot Cheetos on floor and white streaks on mirror. Asked them to clean it the next day and told them the specific parts. Still did not resolve the problems. Disappointing for our first time to Vegas. Also the bed dipped in the middle which is my pet peeve. If that doesn’t bother you then you should be fine.
10,I was being charged for 2 rooms when I only stayed In one. Luckily I looked at my charges on day 2 and I brought to the manager at the front desk. If I and my friend hadn’t asked for clarity of the charges it wouldn’t have been taken care of. Also the mobile check in doesn’t work.
50,Very nice people and very nice rooms. I wouldn't mind coming back to see you guys again. The staff were very nice. Housekeeping made sure we were ok and gave us the things we needed. The front desk got us checked in really quick and very friendly
10,Carpet was filthy something on the wall by bed hair in bed and all over toilet nightstand was dirty. Called to front desk and no one answered after several attempts I gave up. Got no sleep hallways were loud left the hotel at 4:30 in the morning after no sleep.
20,We had issues finding our room and food without asking multiple people for help. The signs did not offer enough information and were not frequent enough to be of use to us. Check-in also took somewhere around 20 minutes to get handled and the charges/bill given on the app was somewhat confusing in their breakdown and payment.
10,Took valet 1hour to find my car because they left the key in the car overnight the sink in the bathroom didn't work the shower didn't have a door so when u take a shower water was everywhere and they didn't put me in different room tell 2 days later it was a vacation from he'll they couldn't pay me to stay at the luxor never again
30,We made a reservation on opentable for Tender which reflected serval times to be available and was told our reservation was canceled due to a large 20 top walking up. Then we purchased late check out and the maid came into our room twice and asked if we were checking out today.
10,Outdated Room Types With Tubs Not Jetted Tubs Overpriced For Old Room Housekeeping Cleans Daily 👍🏽 Inside Hotel Looks Dirty And Not Mantained Elevators Had Problems With Scanning Cards And Buttons In The Hallway Hard To Press  Bed UnComfortable Curtains Dont Block Brightness Coming Inside Room
40,The hotel was nice.. I think it need an update to keep up with the area. I like the vibe.. wasn’t enough drink servers at the casino. I think that could be more workers there to help visitors. Mmmmmmmmm
50,As usual Luxor never fails I was not as happy with the limited dining options and hours. We usually do breakfast lunch or dinner to the Luxor Buffet but dinner was not an option which was kind of a bomber. I must say that I was absolutly stoked with the online app and check-in
20,Bad Front Desk Service. My room was dirty in the moment of the check in and the front desk did not want to help me out with the issue. I had to speak with the manager to solve the situation. it took more than 1 hour
20,I hated being in that hotel the customer service sucks. The app given to me to use a key didn’t work because the service for the phone sucks in that hotel. Which is dangerous for people who may need to call 911 in case of an emergency because of really bad reception and wifi in that hotel.
50,We really enjoyed our stay at the Luxor. We already fellt welcome at the check in. Rick an Garrick at the front desk were really nice and helped us with all our questions (great guys!) The room in the pyramid was really cool and everything was clean. Unfortunately our stay already endet after two days. We had a good time at the Luxor.
50,First time here  parking and check-in was fast and easy. Clean and staff was helpful and friendly. Had a great experience. Will definitely recommend friends and family. Their was alot of entertainment to experience.
30,Luxor left a lot to be desired. We have been to Las Vegas several times and stayed in many nice places. Our room was the absolutely the furthest away from the incline/elevator that you could get. (Which was terrible since I was having trouble walking). The room was as bare bones as you could get. No refrigerator no clock nothing fancy at all. Then there was the pool experience!! No shade and when I tried to move ant chair to some shade they said I couldn’t do that. How terrible since it was 110 degrees and there was NO shade. Unless you pay extra money for a cabana or a special chair. Sunbathing pools are fine but you still need to offer shade for others.
20,The hotel was just ok...lots of kids there it's really not an adult get away ...food in hotel wasn't that great need to step it up some. Diablo Cantina was a step above fast food. Best thing there was pizza in the food court
10,I wouldn’t stay here again. Room ac’s can’t keep up any more our room was close to 80 and they let dogs stay witch is ok but we had one next to us that barked all day. There is nicer place to stay very close.
50,2 bedroom suite very clean and spacious. Delay in checking into the second part of the suite due to housekeeping but front desk was very apologetic and gave us an extra f/b comp credit and moved us to a 2 bedroom suite that was ready. Everyone I encountered was friendly and helpful. Definitely one of my favorite Vegas hotels to stay at
30,I was there celebrating my daughter’s birthday while I worked on a project for a marketing firm. This was my 1st visit to the ONLY hotel on the strip that I have been dreaming about staying. I dreamt about the suite but currently have my money tied up and spent what I could. I have had significantly better experiences for a lot less.
10,Checked in late line was around the lobby and staff was not friendly. Hotel charges resort fees which are mostly hidden or written in the very tiny print after reservation. Resort fees are in violation of Nevada's Deceptive Trade Practices Law. Hotel is not well maintained. Air conditioning is inadequate. Shower is moldy and seals falling off so water leaks all over the floor. Internet access is slow. Halls are hot without adequate air conditioning. Toilet not connected to floor so it wobbled when you sat down got up or wiped your butt. Check out without a person was complicated and website was not friendly.
20,Rooms were clean and the pool is great. We had a issue with t.v from day one of getting in the room. Hallways smelled of weed so bad that I’m actually worried about failing a drug test. Talked to a manager and was told there was nothing they could do about it. I was confused since these were non smoking rooms.
50,Our Anniversary stay at the Luxor was fantastic. Rick from the Front Desk checked us in. He was professional thoughtful kind and made us laugh. The afternoon bartender at chill was awesome. Dinner at Diablos was wonderful. The hostess and our sever Shelby made us feel at home. Nina at the pool was so nice when she checked us into our pod daybed. The pool staff are wonderful. Our sever Morgan was always there to assist us. The guys who refreshed the day bed are so good at there job. Our housekeeper Celeste made us smile. The Luxor has Amazing people amenities restaurants shops and pool area. This is a must stay.
10,Unclean bedding visible furniture stains hard water irritated my skin clogged plumbing unclean shower outdated furnishings overpriced pool chair rentals filthy carpeting dead bugs repugnant plumbing odor etc.
20,Nothing stellar about my stay. The hotel is a bit unkept as it is a multilevel hotel and the rooms located in the back seem to be neglected with chip bags empty bottles and dust debris. There was no microwave or even a refrigerator to keep things cool. Elevators near our room were down which was a hassle being that the hotel is so large. Getting in and out of the hotel was a hassle however once outside of the hotel retrieving a taxi was relatively quick.
40,Staff was pleasant. Room was great could have given five stars had my air conditioning been working properly. It was 110 degrees and room didn’t cool until the sun went dow. They started they were booked and couldn’t change it…had a fan brought to the room. Inside access to other resorts.
30,self parking sucks  It’s super far away from the check in front desk  Staff isn’t the best asked a couple times for something and they responded as if they are making you a favor….  I insist bring your own pillows.  I have stayed here twice and I have neck pain at the next day of my arrival  The view of the new tower it’s awful
30,Dirty room that no one helped me with and the random male staff member walking into my room for no reason but to move a chair and not knocking. Not a great experience overall. Will be staying somewhere else next time.
50,Very friendly staff and security was on top of everything to ensure people were not out of hand. Enjoyed our stay in the pyramid. The pyramid suite was huge! The only thing was it has a huge tub but it was not a whirlpool.
40,The Tower king room is perfect for solo travelers and lovers. TIP: Keep those blackout curtains closed during the day to avoid a hot room! Loved the large bathroom and the shower head is top notch. Room color scheme is dark and sexy. Great views! No fridge. :(
50,Great Great service and hotel. We will defentily be back rooms were awesome and staff was incredible all around Great stay for my family and I. We can't wait to go back and spend more time there. Hopefully we can get in the pool this time. Since teup was short. Found my new favorite hotel
20,Rooms were clean but the AC always kicked off and was very hot. It does not come with a fridge. There’s a spot for one but it looks like it was ripped out. Pool servers rarely came around. The elevators were constantly broken. All around for the money we spent to stay there could have had a much better experience at other hotels on the strip
50,The one thing the MGM brand needs to improve on is clearer definitions and earnings breakdown of its tier credit system. The hotel expenses slots and sports betting are easier to understand but the table game tier credit earning needs to be defined more clearly in the published terms. The MGM app and website needs to offer more detailed breakdowns of points and tier credits.
40,Nice Hotel… good value….. and room was very nice…. Parking experience was great…. No issues at all… will be back next year and best was the check in check out experience no line and digital key …. Overall was a 4.5/5.
20,Slots were tight and elevators for the sweet are a long walk in the back. Very weird. No real good food to offer late night. Buffet closes at 3 and was just okay. I only ate there because it was free.
30,Really didn’t have any interaction with staff. Ac could’ve been better and hot water was limited. More restaurants to choose from would’ve been great. No refrigerator or microwave. The bed and pillows were good.
10,The room smelled of cigarette smoke so bad and the staff would not fix it. The smell came from the AC unit it needed a new air filter and maintenance would not replace it. Housekeeping said they deodorized the room but I never saw them or smelled a difference.
40,Good Hotel we stayed in a Tower Premium King Room which was nice however the bathroom needed a little updating…..we are aware are better quality than the rooms in the main pyramid building.  The hotel itself has everything you need the casino is great some good bars too. Main downside is that the hotel is at the end of the strip next visit to Vegas we would prefer somewhere more central.
50,As a Freemason it’s my favorite place to stay with just the theme alone! Staff are always super friendly. Safe feel family environment clean and tons of fun food and trustworthy tables. We always win big at Luxor with the entire experience.
50,First time visiting Las Vegas didn’t win any money but enjoyed my stay!!! The food was good but wish The Buffet would offer different varieties of food(like more vegetables) like breakfast lunch and supper. Will be visiting again
50,I was in Vegas traveling for business and wanted to stay at one of the iconic hotels on the strip. I was pleasantly surprised by the affordability of the Luxor which included a daily food and beverage credit.  The amenities on site and the direct walkway connections to the Mandalay Bay and Excalibur hotels restaurants and shops meant I pretty much stayed within a few minutes walking of my room and never got bored. My room was very clean and the bed was exceptionally comfortable.  Plus where else can you stay where the elevators travel diagonally?  Be aware that my room did not have a refrigerator or microwave so do make the request if needed.
30,Overall our experience was okay. However long hold times to get hold of staff. The room was not clean to my standards. The vending machines were empty the entire stay. The food was not that great. The vendors were very pushy.
20,They do not provide shade at the pool and the pool is no where near the best I’ve been to. It was subpar at best and I felt like Luxor was trying to squeeze a dollar out of me at every opportunity. I’m not cheap but I don’t like being tricked.
50,Excellent value. I always wanted to stay here bach in the 80's when it was new. Very well- kept and must have been updated. Clean and quiet! Really nice room and easy check out. Great benefits for military.
20,No vent fan in the bathroom. Bathroom cabinet falling apart. Place where refrigerator sat was water damaged and rotten. Bed was horrible I literally fell in a while when I rolled over. Needs repair and updated to suite. Floor dirty
30,It’s 3 football fields to get to your car from the room and ac unit in our room wasn’t working well in the middle of the summer. No shower curtain so be careful of wet bathroom floors. No bellman’s carts available in the parking lot nor the uber drop-off. No cell reception in elevators so ready your mobile door key before entering or else you’ll be sent back to 1st floor. The room was clean and the staff are very friendly.
50,Luxor is very nice place to stay. Excellent restaurants very nice exhibits and the shows are fantastic. The blue men show are incredible good. The pool is also a great place to fight the high temperatures in vegas. All the people who works in luxor are also available to help.
10,Pubic hair was in the bathroom in a corner in the shower and on the toilet and there was also used hair ties hooked on the door. Also paper on the floor by the bed. When I asked to switch rooms I was conveniently told there were no more rooms that housekeeping would come clean. A while had passed (it was past midnight at this point) and I had to call back and re-request for housekeeping to show up at that time the person on the phone said she would page the manager to send someone. When they came to clean although he was very nice and apologetic the new towels he replaced the old ones with had hair in them. Lastly the internet was terrible and I was told to go outside and log in to Luxor’s wifi so that it would work. Absolutely horrible experience. Never again.
50,we booked the Luxor during forth of July weekend it was not to packed like the bigger casinos. easy access to the tram as well as the parking garage. staff was very friendly and helpful. titanic and body's where very inexpensive and great attractions. and if you haven't seen blue man group you have to check it out
50,We chose Luxor primarily because of the pool area. We loved everything else about the hotel. Express check in and check out are the best. Fast and easy! Friendly staff and environment. We will definitely stay here again!
50,Overall it was a enjoyable stay. Check in was easy. The room was nice and clean. The casino was nice. There is easy access to other casinos. I enjoyed a few meals at a couple of the restaurants. I plan to stay again at the Luxor in August.
50,I would stay at this hotel again! It was clean and we ran into lots of amazing staff! I felt like the casino was open and spread out. Lots of shows and places to eat. There was 4 pools not all of them were open but still plenty of room to swim.
30,My first day down it was beautiful as I park the car and started walking towards the hotel I noticed there’s glitter everywhere the garbage all around me. Elevators were dirty I felt like the hotel was being abused
10,Simply put I moved rooms and each room was equally poorly cleaned. I was then offered a third room switch which I declined as every room was dirty including the hotel common areas and casino. Supervisor sent the housekeeping supervisor to clean the room. I have stayed plenty of times before but I would completely bypass this hotel if cleanliness means anything to you. The dried committee on the wall next to the toilet was the final straw for me.
50,The hotel was nice just one day we had elevator problems. The room was cleaned everyday with fresh linen! We ate at the Pyramid Cafe and the food was actually good! The Blue Man Group show was funny. My granddaughter is 8 and she also enjoyed the show!
10,Beds were not comfortable and pillows were flat. Asked for extra pillows and were denied. Paper thin walls. Could hear everything pwople from the next room were doing and I mean everything. Housekeeping were cleaning rooms at night time. 2- 3 In the morning with the loud vacuum.
20,"The shower leaked all over the floor because half the door was missing to save costs. The front desk said to ask for more towels from house keeping and it was a known problem. 20 minutes on hold to reach guest services. The swimming pool monetized every inch of shade and would not allow moving ""free"" chairs. $170 an hour for shade was more than my hotel room. The Hotel room had no fire escape option. The fridge and microwave were obviously removed leaving a gaping hole with a rough note ""use this space how you would like""."
30,"I didn't really care for the West Tower Rooms at The Luxor. Ther were no refrigerators microwaves coffee makers & not even a hair dryer! I'm glad there was a TV. It has become more ""family oriented"" which I don't really care for. I love kids but just not in Vegas. ALL the staff was very friendly. And so were the Bartenders!"
20,No microwave no refrigerator no coffee or tea facilities inside the room. In 2022? Even Extended Stay has these. I’m not sure if this is a Vegas thing or a Luxor thing but this is totally poor for a $200/night hotel. I thought I could cope without these until I tried it. NEVER AGAIN. We threw away soooo much food that could’ve been eaten again at night or the next day it wasn’t even funny. But I guess that’s their strategy. Keep buying food and drinks till you leave!!!
10,We booked a stay. Our AC in our room did NOT work. It was so hot that the cheesecake i bought melted within minutes. It was impossible to get a staff member to come fix it. Very irritated. They also do not provide a fridge.
10,Broken ac. Moved multiple rooms. Having to pack and unpack and haul our things waisting so much of the trip. Spent hours waiting in line for new keys etc. got moved far from all our friends out to tower and that room finally had working ac but absolutely filthy. Someone else’s playing card in couch cushion jerky on floors big stains on carpet hairs on towels and dust everywhere. Horrible experience
50,These rooms are very nice. Bedding is really comfortable. Room is cleanand air conditioner works perfectly. The check in process on the app is so convenient. Very easy to use. The parking fee is a bit high at eighteen dollars a day.
40,Last time I went to the Luxor was when I was 9. I don't remember much but I know the rooms looked better. Coming back and seeing the rooms now I wish they would fix the sink and the shower. I don't complain much but
40,Room is good size. Bell desk is fast. Rollaway bed is good size and delivered in time. Wish mailing service is more straightforward. Right now Luxor is using Mandalay Bay business center to handle guest mails.
10,Huge lines to check in. Room on 3rd floor had so much noise could not sleep. Waited all next day to see if we could move rooms. Neither room was clean. No amenities and not enough staff. I had to call the 800 number to speak to ask for help many times to get help. Long hold on that number too
50,We booked Luxor because we liked the price but thought maybe it would look tired and old when we arrived since it has been around for a long time. We found just the opposite. What a spectacular structure. It’s been well maintained and has all the modern bells and whistles you’d expect from a newer property. The staff is amazing and we had a lot of fun. Our room was in the East Tower. It was spacious and amazing. We will be back
20,Good enough room was outdated and A/C couldn't keep up. Resort fee's are to high food credit is not worth it--can't use it in their food court at all. No room fridge you have to pay for one. No coffee/clock/blowdryer. I get the digital key but wifi doesn't work in the elevator so accessing your key in their app to reach your floor is a pain. For the amount charged you can get much better. Beds were comfortable despite a hot room.
10,Advertised rate was $119 I ended up paying over $300! Total scam. You wait nearly an hour in the check in line and at 10pm when you have no other choices you find out they have “secret unadvertised” ad ons that push your rate to 3x’s what they advertise.
20,Room was adjacent to housekeeping who created significant noise starting at 6 or 7 every morning. Room A/C didn't work properly and maintenance told us to get a new room without trying to fix it. Check out wait in line was unacceptable. Room had no view. I expected more with my MGM Rewards membership.
30,Restaurants closed early or weren’t open. Not many affordable food options. Pool was only 3 ft. Rooms were okay but reminded me of a cheap motel. Lines for everything were always incredibly long. Only stayed 2 days.
50,Very good thank you. I enjoyed it very much. I recommend it . Easy to check in and out. The pool was nice but very little shade. Specially now that is summer.burning like never before. Maybe some free shade would be appreciated.
50,Luxor towers is always great. Rooms are generous and clean and the views are beautiful and the pools are clean and large. The service is always top notch and the staff are always helpful friendly and anxious to help. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend staying there on your next visit to Vegas.
40,Was our first time in Las Vegas and I believe we did good by choosing this hotel.  it's like 5 minutes drive to the airport.  I tried doing the online registration but didn't work for me so I did the long line but the waiting was not that bad. Customer service was good. I only wish the rooms had a microwave/mini-fridge. Other than that the room was nice clean comfortable beds and quiet.
50,I love the place. Staying in Luxor is always exciting and full of fun and action. Since the buffet is now again serving it really adds to my eagerness to return to Las Vegas and enjoy what Luxor has to provide for my next visit. I and my partner are pleased about it.
10,Checking into this hotel was an absolute joke. 50 or so people standing in line to check in and staff were leaving in the middle of this. Took over 30 minutes to check in. Facility was absolutely filthy. Pool area was disgusting. Garbage cans were overflowing with trash. Chairs at the pool area were caked with filth. Parking garage was a pain in the ass to get to. Room key wouldn’t work to get in or out of parking garage. Hotel and casino were grossly dirty. But you just keep counting all the money you’re making and you’ll be fine.
40,Went there last year for three days. It was convenient it being connected to two other hotels and is also located close to other hotels on the strip. Room it's self was clean and spacious. Overall good time
30,Rooms can smell musty we upgraded to tower west rooms on 6th floor. Seemed better than the rest. Room service isn’t that great menu options are slim. The TV lags so the shows are sometimes interrupted- poor service .The Gym was hot no cool AC
50,Booked the hotel day of and had an amazing room! Well worth the money. The floor is pretty clean and they are right next to the hyperx esports arena if you need somewhere to drop your kids off. Definitely will be coming back with friends.
30,Every time I visit Las Vegas I stay at Luxor. Unfortunately this visit… each night… they closed the parking structure. Circling around for parking for 45 minutes isn’t fun at 330 in the morning and then being suckered to pay $20 for valet when you get free parking is totally unacceptable!
50,Awesome visit I won money The atmosphere was great Folks seemed happy Glad to be out The Citizen Restaurant was delicious Please send me some more free nights I'll be back for my anniversary It was a great time I missed you Luxor
40,We had a good time at a very great savings. MGM offers great room-rates and savings. And the Mandalay Bay Luxor Excalibur New York New York Park MGM and the MGM are all located together. The location is excellent.
10,Not worth the money hidden fees charged me for checking out before 11 because my flight left early out dated rooms broken appliances in room and customer service did not seem to care told me nothing they can do about it would not recommend staying here.
10,Black Jack tables where much higher minimum many of my favorite slot machines are no longer available like Game of Thrones Ellen Deal or no Deal Big Bang Theory BatmanTexas Sweet Tea the App would not let me get multiple rooms/keys for my party/friend no room fridge no extra blankets or pillows AC in my mothers room was too high tried to make temp a bit hotter and AC would still turn on cold also my room 10099 the carpet was very wet soaked my socks I only take showers not baths but the tub filled up to the top the drain was very slow Had to wipe soap suds off my legs also at the buffet you removed several items we used to like and you no longer have the all day or multiple buffets. What happened to Mc Donalds ? Also not enough waitresses coming around wait was very long and we are not big drinkers usually get water and a mixed drink.
50,great comps excellent room accommodations quick check in and video out great dinner at steak excellent service. house.quicker service with m-life cards.valet service as always was great baggage carriers were quick and organized. many entertainment choices. great drinks at bar and at slot machines.
50,The hotel was wonderful. It was even better than expected. The price was amazing. There were great restaurants within walking distance. Would definitely stay there again.  Walking distance to everything. Beautiful rooms great ambiance in the hotel dining room and bar. We will come again!Great location. We really loved the character of the hotel. The restaurant was fantastic and staff was friendly and helpful. South end of the strip  hotel with super friendly staff and beautifully clean rooms. The restaurant downstairs has amazing food!
30,The One Bedroom Elite suite has a fantastic layout and even though I reserved it two months before my trip the front desk advised me that the room was no longer available.  This is the first time I have been downgraded. The check-in spoiled the r3est of my trip.
10,Had I three night stay in a Premium king suite. Nothing about the room was premium. The tv was outdated. There was gum on the floor. The shower had half a door. I asked for pillows and got none. Awful
50,My family and I had great time. Definitely will be staying there again. The pool was great my kids loved it and your buffet was amazing! It was one of the best stays we have ever had. I love the fact you have almost everything you want to do under one roof.
30,It was crazy to have to pay for a refrigerator considering the rate we are already paying for the room. Also after being there 2 nights I asked housekeeping to change the bedding and towels and they left the same dirty bedding on the bed.
50,My stay was very enjoyable I really enjoyed myself. A very beautiful hotel inside and out and my housekeeper was awesome she came everyday to hook my room up for me and anything I needed she got for me 😊
50,Very clean and the staff were excellent. Thanks. Lots of places to eat and very easy to get on the shuttle. Lots of different kinds of food and games to play. Plus they gave me a great rate and some extras too.
40,For $45/night (plus a resort fee) this was a great deal! The rooms were up-to-date and clean although it did have a bad smell (sewage-like)when you enter the room; you got used to it in minutes. I ran into another couple that had the same experience and moved. They mentioned their next room had the same smell.    The location to the Mandalay Bay Resort and Convention Center where our conference and meetings too place was outstanding. I never had to walk outside in the 108 degree weather.    The rest of the resort was very clean and inviting.
50,food was great pool great need two be open longer people great room very clean great view caesar    salad with blanked salmon best i have had casino was clean and bright lots of good slot two play
50,Great room had a good size and good bed.  The casino was good as well we all had a good time. We even caught the Mind Freak Show and that was the highlight of the trip.    Great atmosphere I will definitely be back.
50,Beautiful rooms and very friendly and helpful staff. Easy signs to see where you are going. Lots of good places to eat. Shops to shop. Nice walkway between casinos and hotels. Had a wonderful stay with friends.
50,It was a fantastic time from check in to check out. Staff was fantastic upgraded our room upon check in ended up with some great comps and great offers for our next trip. We had so much fun that we’re coming back in August for my birthday.
50,Very nice time check in went smoothly even got a meal voucher gambling was up and down but that was ok meals were good room was nice but not extravagant really loved the pool area worth going back Been to other Hotels but Luxor rates right up there
10,Food was gross and cold at the buffet  The tub was dirty no one cleaned the closet it was full of dust and lint balls. No microwave sucked. No free refrigerator sucked. Was very expensive for a teeny tiny room.
30,Hotel room wasn’t very clean and there were a few things around the hotel that was a bit run down. Service was great and the cafe fantastic. More security within the hotel would have been nice as there were a couple instances that were uncomfortable
50,I love the Egyptian theme throughout the casino & hotel. During my stay there were great events and shows at the Luxor (The Titanic Bodies and Carrot Top to name a few). Luxor is in a great location to other casinos and it’s close to the airport as well.
40,Accommodation entertainment accessibility food were all good. Valet parking & luggage assistance were also very good. Better yet there were less smokers around so it was really a breathable environment.
50,Luxor is a Great hotel good service. Clean. Love the buffet. Watch the blue man show and the bodies exhibit. Was going to check out the titanic but the power when off hope to see it next time I travel to Las Vegas.
30,i havent gotten my deposit back yet its been over a month the front desk said it would be back into my account in a couple of days i havent recieved it yet i want to know why cant get a hold of nobody
30,I know it is summer and every where is hot but this was not acceptable. The AC was changed in the middle of the night but we did not turn it off. One night was horrible but the rest was bearable. The only thing good about this place is the price. Get what you pay for...or don't.
50,We had a wonderful time and very relaxing. I found the Hotel was clean and the staff was very friendly and helpful. We enjoyed eating at the Hotel and walking around. Loved 🥰 playing on the slots. Can’t wait to go again real soon.
50,Excellent!! The Service was fantastic! Food exceptional!! The Ambiance was great. We had a great girls weekend. Spent a few hours on Fremont Street. Very pleased with our room. View was not the best but you don’t spend your time in Vegas in your room.
50,Lovet we have the best time my family sister and live first time and we coming back soon my daughter so happy Cuatomer service so amazing you need to go the best memories for my family me and my husband will always coming back
40,Nice hotel. Very open concept with 3 large pools that were very clean. Lots of lounge chairs outside. Customer service was good and Cafe in the hotel had very good breakfast. Some machines paid well.  Would stay there again.
30,The staff was very courteous and helpful especially when it came to dealing with issues related to our room...and there were several at various points during our four night stay including:  AC not working  No hot water  Safe in room not working.    The room itself was spacious and clean; the fitness center was fine. There were several options for eating and drinking and from the dealers to the servers the staff was incredible.    However this was the first time my wife and I stayed at Luxor for a visit to Las Vegas; it will be the last. There are just too many other options that offer the same value without the hassle.
40,The MGM Rewards app made the entire experience easier than I’ve ever dealt with a resort. It literally makes everything I mean everything easy. Most staff was very friendly and helpful. Will definitely come back again
40,The room was nice but it was way too far from the elevator. Coming back from a tiring and hot day walking the strip and you have to walk much more ro get to your room. Maybe because I got it for a cheap rate that's why we were given a room way in there
50,Great service  Beautiful view great location room service a was great  pool was amazing with dj on weekend Best VIP reservation and service. I definitely I bookend my next vacation back to LUXOR!! Thanks for a great team!!
50,Customer services was awesome. Our rooms were beautiful the remodels nice. The stay was comfortable and nice. We really enjoyed our stay as a family. If you offer any rewards to stay at your hotel we will most Definitely stay again this year. Thank you again for the stay.
50,Was a good stay as always. Room was ready front desk and bell desk know me and my family we are there every 2 to 3 months they are always accommodating but wish I was to get suite offers again. Brought three new people family and they enjoyed it.
50,I was in Vegas for a work conference held at Mandalay Bay. This was my first stay at Luxor and I was unaware of the convenience of being able to walk from the Luxor to Mandalay Bay without stepping foot outside in the Vegas heat. Typically rooms in Vegas are smoky but my room was perfect. I was on the 3rd floor it wasn't smoky and the room was in great condition.
50,Loved the Luxor! Didn't have time for the incredible looking pool. Will request first floor for ease of smoking. We used grubhub to bypass the wait at the restaurants. I liked the tilted windows and the elevator. The employee's were friendly and professional.
40,"Everything was great. I'm not a fan of the shower ""doors"" or lack thereof but everything else was super. Nice rooms. Noise is minimal. Check-in is easy. Lots of convenience stores but the rooms really should have small refrigerators and mini-microwaves."
40,The Luxor offers an overwhelming amount of things to do for family and couples in addition to being a great hotel. For example there are shows such as Blue Man Group America's got talent and the Titanic exhibit there. Futher the pool is a great way to relax and have fun. There a 3-4 pools to choose from. Further food options are more than enough. For example on the main floor you can eat at the at the pyramid cafe or eat at the buffet on level down. If those options are not appealing to you you can you up to the upper level where you will find additon food options.  I would stay there again.
50,Always enjoyable. We went to Vegas to see our grand daughter for her 3rd birthday. We took our youngest daughter with us to experience her first time in a casino since being 21. We always stay at the Luxor
50,I got comp my stay along with resort fee and $250 resort credit plus $175 free play.  If you want my money to “come on down”  Stay as to be completely complementary  The hotel’s need to give rooms away or why stay there when I can try out 10 more on the strip. It’s easy I’m older I like to gamble and if you want my money then make me have to stay there to spend it
50,I had a good time. Everything was as I expected. The place was clean. The bed was soft. I had a nice view of the strip. The Pyramid Cafe had the best breakfast on the strip . The waffles were really good. Eggs Benedict was also good. The pool was just okay. Lots of people during the day. Gambling was hot and cold. Lots of games to choose from. Red Hot is a good one.
50,We booked a room last minute while traveling from California to Utah. Room was updated spacious clean and comfortable. Pleasantly surprised. Staff was friendly at check in. Wish we could stay longer!
50,The rooms were exquisite and spacious. They anticipated every need and offered assistance at every opportunity to make sure I had a great time. They only thing I would suggest is they would at least provide a mini fridge and a microwave.
50,Great hotel rooms delicious food options lovely pool. Awesome casino. Wonderful staff professional and accommodating. Can't wait to return in August!  Luxor you are our new favorite place to stay...xoxo
20,The hotel room had a horrible smell. Then they tried to mask it with perfume so it was a really bad combo. We had to cut our trip short because we couldn’t sleep another night like that. The carpet and hallways are dirty. I would just recommend to save some more money and book somewhere nicer. Check in/check out was easy we did it through the app.
20,No amenities to speak of really when you have to pay extra for a mini fridge it is disappointing.  Staff was not sure where to direct us when we asked for the tour bus parking spot.  Could not print and had to be charged for internet thankfully someone came to help and print for me.  Lights were our in the room didn't bother to ask to get it fixed.
50,We always enjoy the location here. The Luxor always provides lots of fun gaming entertainment. The rooms are very nice and super clean. The food is always good. We would definitely be glad to stay here again or at any of the other MGM properties.
50,We’ve been coming to the Luxor for years and it’s never a disappointment! The staff are very friendly the food is great and the rooms are extremely nice. If you’re looking for a place that has it all you should definitely visit the Luxor!
10,My room didn’t have Central A/C. It was hotter in my room than it was outside. Tried to get a different room and was told there was none available. I was told I haven’t received my refund since I had to cancel and book somewhere else.
20,I booked a two night hotel stay here. And mind you I am a member also so I was getting lower Rates for the stays. I made a reservation for Fourth of July ahead of time and was going to be charged $260 Upon check in. We got to the hotel and they did not of a remote or a do not disturb sign. I was upset. Then upon check out I looked in my bank account and saw that they charged me $360 plus an extra charge of $60. So I payed $420. Like WTF. Apparently they are suppose to send me back the extra charges within 5-7 business days. This never happened to me before. I hope they are telling the truth if not I will file a claim.
20,Check-in took 3 trips to front desk - forget about mobile check-in if you have more than 1 room. Two bedroom deluxe suite never dropped below 80 degrees even after multiple 'fix-its'. The rooms and beds were worn and had multiple broken elements.Front desk became very unresponsive to our issues and we spent way too much of our vacation dealing with problems.
30,Booked the Luxor 5 months in advance to celebrate my 40th birthday. Booked cabana 3.5 months in advance only to be told the day of that there is maintenance being done on the pool. Very disappointed that wasn’t communicated prior to. My favorite things about Luxor are the pool and the location and this trip sucked.
50,The LUXOR did not disappoint. It was within walking distance to most of the Vegas Attractions that my wife and I wanted to visit. There was always a member of their staff ready and available if anything was needed. Siimple check in/out. We will be Bacjlk. Thanks
40,Elevators were down so we had a little longer wait time to get to room. Everything else was great! I recommend taking tram down strip! Good selection of places to eat inside the hotel and Luxor connects to the Mandalay Shoppes with more places go eat and shop. Good bang for buck hotel!
10,Horrible customer service dirty hotel rooms the only good thing about this hotel is the valet there the only ones with a decent attitude our room was a non smoking room yet it smelled like a dispensary I don’t mind people smoking it’s Vegas however if you ask for a non smoking room and you get one that was clearly wasn’t cleaned you would be upset I was also overcharged
40,Best option to stay if your are attending to the Temptation Sundays event at the Oasis pool in the Luxor. Having the on line check-in option was another great reason to select the Luxor hotel again in future.
10,Bad experience to much wait in line room smelled bad and I was duty I call the service room 2 times and they never solve my problem. I didn’t like the experience to stay in Luxor . Bad service and bad room
10,Unfortunately we checked into a room that was dirty with hair and use soap in shower. The surfaces where sticky and felt dirty. When moved the next room had foul odor in hall which we discovered was coming from the bathroom and living room seating area. The room had bug infestation. The soaking tub had iridescent glitter from prior guest and other stain which was obviously not cleaned prior to moving. After spending two days bouncing between rooms the solution from management was to refund resorts fees!
10,booked a corner pyramid suite and the hvac system was not running properly in the room. I asked to be moved rooms around 2pm and they said they could not but would send a technician out to the room. I waited until 7pm and did not hear a word from anyone. I contacted front desk back and they said they never received a work order for someone to check the air conditioning. They finally moved me rooms and stated that my resort fees would be waived (by manager Logan) and they were not! I have downgraded rooms and received the worst experience on the strip i have ever had.
40,I would come back to this resort. Nice staff clean room. Great pricing! The only thing is that the lady who serves drinks at table a bit slow but I understand she has a lot of tables to go. Great experience over all!
50,As usual we had a great time  good food and a friendly host and staff having stayed many times at different properties has given us the opportunity to explore the Best of what Las Vegas has to offer.
10,Upon arrival my wife and I were greeted by a dead roach. We immediately called front desk and they said they were sending out housekeeping to fix the issue. After multiple phone calls and front desk giving us the run around housekeeping finally came over an hour later. They did not want to give us a new room since they were apparently sold out and offered us food credit instead.
20,We have stayed at the LUXOR several times over the years and this stay will be our last. The Hotel is outdated and the rooms are mediocre at best! We upgraded to a Suite and the carpet and furnishings were old. They did not allow us to have late Housekeeping service one night which is unacceptable. Certain room categories should always have housekeeping services that's why we pay the extra upgraded costs!
50,Great rooms great pool and the exhibits were cool to see. The pool was impressive and very nice not a crowded feeling considering we were here on a long weekend. Location is at the end of the strip so wandering around is not great in the heat cooler months is fine. There is the tram to connect to the hotels but I did not use it this trip.
50,My experience was great. Rooms had some updated furniture to make I look a little more modern and up to date. The check in process was amazing considering I did everything from my phone. I most definitely would stay there again.
50,No issues. Easy check in. Nice room. Comfortable bed and pillows. Great casino. Nice pool. Had a great time with my friends and family. Second time staying at the Luxor. I would definitely stay again.
40,Never stayed at this particular MGM Resort always seemed to busy and assumed Customer Service would be so-so. I must admit I enjoyed the VIP experience overall my suite was very comfortable pool enjoyable dining experience excellent. Overall a good experience.
10,The showers were not draining properly in 2 out of the 3 rooms I paid for. I’m 1 room the hairs were coming up from the drain into the shower. I’m the other it was not draining. The sink also was not draining. My family members in the room with the hairs did not wa t to shower the next day. It was quite embarrassing as I booked this hotel.
10,"When I checked in I was originally given a room in the tower. I told the person that I wanted to stay in the pyramid so my kids can see the view from the balcony down into the hotel and that I wanted to experience the ride in the diagonal elevators. I was then given a room in the pyramid on the 2nd floor. It was an enclosed hallway with no balcony and it didn't use the diagonal elevators. When assigned the room I wasn't told that we wouldn't experience all of that; even though it was specifically mentioned.    The room was run down didn't have a refrigerator and my wife had medication that needed to be refrigerated. When asked we were given a ""Medical refrigerator"" which is one that doesn't use refrigerant and only can drop the temperature a max of 20 degrees below the room temp. We asked if they could help freeze an ice pack so we can transport her medication when we left the hotel but was told it couldn't be done.    The air conditioner in the room was inadequate. The room hardly felt air conditioned.    We had a 4 person room and when I asked a room cleaner to exchange towels she told me she could only give us 2 towels and that we would have to call for more. Doesn't make sense to provide only 2 towels for a 4 person room. The bathroom didn't have towel racks to hang used towels to dry so they could be reused.    I signed up for parking but the parking didn't work with my room key. The lines at the registration desk were long and there were few employees to help so the wait was long. I was told that I needed to go to the front desk to take the parking off my account for the 3rd night; couldn't do it through the app or by phone. So inconvenient.    I asked about help with transport to the airport since I had a group of 4 with luggage and would need a van. When I asked if they could call a taxi for me they told me they couldn't. I've never seen a hotel that couldn't provide this service.    The shower drain was slow and the shower pan would fill up half way for each shower."
20,With no prior warning we found ourselves in a room in the Pyramid placed at the far end of the Hotel's HVAC system and overlooking the wall of the hotel next door. I was very unh6with this location. I would not recommend making reservations without confirming that your room is in a central part of the hotel and doesn't have a window that looks out at a wall.
20,"AC sucked called couple times.  Paid a little extra for the ""LAND PROMO"" which no worker knew what it was.  Traveled with VB team rooms not on same floor unable to go to other floors.  Rooms not the cleanest."
10,No coffee maker no microwave No refrigerator. My thermostat was broken first night they fixed it the second night but it cost me a night’s sleep. Overall they are just short staffed and Cheapcheap cheap!
10,Been there multiple times all the time there’s something make you come back but not this time ! … very sorry to say that customer service haven’t contacted me after a week and May not even interested to come back again! 😔
10,This place is dirty and outdated. Not enough food choices. Rude check-in staff. Parking is horrendous and expensive. There are two quarter slots on the whole casino floor. Barely and cocktail waitresses. Almost all the slots are Chinese digital nonsense penny slots.
20,Room was nice but dirty! It that room was clean and everything worked it would definitely be worth the price. What I got was not what I paid for. The casino area is great very clean. The buffet was amazing but the room cleanliness was a huge turn off.
10,The hotel is dark and dingy with outdated decor. The room was very dark with excessively loud air conditioning. Would definitely not recommend based on the high price - it looks like there has not been any investment in the facilities for many years.
10,I never got my deposit back plus they over charged me $200 I will call a attorney terrible management I spoke with two of them they say that they’re is nothing they can do in regards to my stay! I will never recommend this hotel
10,Ramshackle little pyramid of cards that’s falling apart elevators that shake and screetch and can’t possibly be within any metric of legal maintenance housekeeping that does a terrible job cleaning and also just barges right into your room by accident at 3AM a “mobile checkin” that takes two front desk people 45mins to fix because of technical difficulties….save yourself the headache and just go to a Caesar’s property.    This was such a BS laden waste.
10,Crappy service they will try to get over on you at check in. Ac sucks. Long walk from self parking to hotel. Handicap ramps super narrow. My room was dirty and ac didnt work. The front desk wanted to charge me $76 for a compt room i showed up late to.
30,Most of the staff was super friendly main issue was the lack of cleanliness in the guest room areas. There were trash bags every time we walked on our floors hallways. There was a smushed cigar by the elevator.
20,My AC in m room did not work at all and I could not sleep comfortably for the entire stay I would not recommend either because the elevators were down and I had to walk pretty far just to get the first level from the 4th.
30,You can just tell the housekeeping staff does the bare minimum. After COVID I feel like hotels everywhere have really slacked off housekeeping even though it should be the opposite. I’d honestly expect more from large hotels in Vegas.
50,10 night stay in a Pyramid room on the 23rd floor. Room was a good size with two Queen beds which were very comfortable. Room was very clean and housekeeping maintained this standard of cleanliness throughout our stay. Bottled water was provided  though for some reason not every day(no big deal wasn’t expecting it anyway!). Went to the pool on a few occasions no problem getting sun loungers and again the area was well kept. It got a bit busy/noisy in the afternoons……if only I was younger! Got a BOGOF at the buffet using my MLife rewards had read mixed reviews have to say I was well impressed! During our stay there was a power cut for a few hours so couldn’t get access to our room. I got $100 food and drink credit as compensation can’t be bad to that! Overall I had a great experience at the Luxor and wouldn’t hesitate on booking this Hotel again. Definitely got value for money!
50,Sometimes the elevators got packed but overall a great stay. The buffet was ridiculously priced. For a family of 4 with two kids…$147. That’s crazy. However the America’s Got Talent show was well worth it.
20,Beware of excessive Late checkout fees if not booked with Luxor directly. I booked with COSTCO and needed a 3pm late checkout due to 6pm flight. Website states $30 and was expecting to pay that but at check in was told its $60 because I didn't book directly. ($45 if checkout at 1pm). Nowhere does it state $60 late checkout fee at any MGM properties. Just Beware!
40,Excellent location on the strip nice parking area. Has everything you need in one area. Connected Mandalay Bay and Excalibur. Restaurants has good food  some ok shops not the greatest good attractions in the hotel to keep one busy for a couple of days.
10,Rooms don't have refrigerator or microwaves and the rooms or outdated. The room smelled like Marijuana the keys to the room didn't work all the time in the elevator. The buffet in the hotel is okay. Need more restaurants
40,Rooms were huge and beds were so comfy!!! I also stayed here in 2016 and the rooms seem to have had a revamp. The air con is much better than I remember it being last time!! I’ve rated it 4 out of 5 as you do not get a fridge as standard in the room which I feel is quite poor when it’s so hot outside and you want to keep things cool you have to pay extra for one. Resort fees are extortionate but I think this is all relative in Vegas!
20,Everything above the lobby is filthy! When you stay inside the pyramid and look down into the casino it's just disgusting! On top of that half of the escalators were out of service. The only positive was that the staff was excellent.
40,First time stay at his hotel. I had a very nice room with view and separate sitting area. The AC didn't work in the sitting area. The first maintenance guy didn't fix it but when we returned to our room later that night had to call again. They bought us a fan but it got fixed the very next day. They did waive the resort fee for that day due to the inconvenience. Even though this happen I'd probably stay here again.
20,"The room was very dirty. Layers of dust on the furniture so much so that I was able to write ""Eww"" in dust on the dresser. AC unit was clunky would rattle in the middle of night click on and off then the heat would turn on. Unit would sometimes just shut off when we would leave and the room would be very hot once we arrived. Shower design will likey cause them big water damage issues in the future. There is no door on the shower so overspray goes all over the bathroom floor. You can already see the drywall damage from it in several rooms. But the price for a quick weekend getaway is what attracted us. You get what you pay for. A first and a last stay at a Luxor. I'll spend a little extra next time."
20,For the price I would spend a few more bucks and stay at NY NY or ParkMGM. Why?  - The location is less than optimal.  - The elevators are filthy few slow and in various states of aesthetic disrepair (I'm being kind).  - There was no door or curtain on the shower which led to a mildew stink in the room with obvious damage to the door.  - The windows were filthy leading to an even glum view of Las Vegas from that side.  - Room was poorly cleaned around the bed.  - No mini-fridge no coffee-maker nada.  - Unless you luck out with a room near the elevator (trade-off is foot traffic noise) you get a nice longggg walk whenever you want to leave the room.  - The tram stop at Luxor is outside not fun between June-August.    The few good things...    - Check-in is easy with mobile check-in so you get to avoid the smoky lines.  - Quieter than most sub-par spots whether MGM or Caesar's family.    I won't be staying at the Luxor again I don't care how many comped nights I get.
30,We like staying at the Luxor but this time was a very bad experience check-in was brutal no precautions in place for COVID-19 no wipes to clean the machines hand sanitizer containers were empty servers were poor we waited a long time to get drinks and expected tips after they were 45 minutes late to bring our drinks the pools were shut down on two separate occasions need to do better Luxor do not eat at diablos brutal food experience
20,Rooms in the Pyramid were bad! 104 deg and AC has motion detector that shuts off when you leave room or go to sleep! Woke up with room on 80 deg. Staff is friendly but overall the Luxor need lots of work!
30,Over all it was okay they do need to add microwave and fridges in rooms. As well as room service. I was tired from the road trip and we still had to go down to have dinner. I have preferred to order room service and rest.
50,Overall the reward credit was great and location. Pools coulda been better my kids wanted to go to another pool was closed til we were leaving they opened up the other pool. And there was no fridge in the hotel room. Staff were friendly correcting my Parking charge and delivering towels.
50,The room beat our expectations and the couples massage we had did too! The waiter at the Pyramid Cafe was excellant the second morning when we arrived he called us by our name and even remembered our order from the day before.
50,Tbey have the best front desk employees that you need to meet before you start your trip in Vegas. anything wrong could happened they will quickly would turn it out up to your satisfaction for example when the pool had to be shuted down due to wind the Send us to the pool in the next hotel the Delaya Bay hotel
20,My rooms AC would actually raise the ambient room temperature. There was a day when I left my AC on 60 degrees all day by the time I got back 5 hours later my room was 83 degrees. My first three attempts to get this fixed resulted in nothing and it took making noise at the front desk to get someone to do the bare minimim that should've been done days beforehand. I had to go get a new room at the Cosmo just so I could sleep due to how hot it was which took money away from what would have bought UFC tickets (the whole reason we came to Vegas). So instead of watching the live fight we sat in a downgraded room watching the PPV on a computer.
40,I have stayed here many times. It's fun but as lone of the lower level hotels on the Strip you get what you pay for. The staff is great rooms are clean but a little old. They need to replace all the electronics as they are very dated. The beds are nice and for my back at least good for a full nights sleep.    I will say that the Spa is excellent for men. The pool area is great with a very large pool.    The casino is nice and I always have good luck at the craps table here and OK luck in the high roller slot area. For some reason I win here more then the other MGM sites which is why I stay here if I am coming in to town by myself.    One major problem this trip was that the power in the entire building went out from 10 AM to about 3PM one day. Not the end of the world except for the fact that . THE EMERGENCY LIGHTS IN THE STAIRWELLS DID NOT TURN ON. IT WAS A LONG 16 FLIGHTS DOWN THE STAIRS FROM MY ROOM WITH MY CELL PHONE AS THE ONLY LIGHT. I understand electrical problems happen but you would think they would have had staff with flashlights in the stairwells to assist guest trying to leave the building. Thank whoever you pray to that it was not a fire or a crazy person shooting.    With all that said I had a great time and will stay here again.
20,Luxor used to be the place to be unfortunately elevators were not working everyone had to compile into one elevator risking potential COVID. I was positive COVID after stay at this casino! It’s extremely discouraging and I will not be going back to this hotel nor recommending.
10,The air conditioner sucks. Made us all sick. Room very dusty. No one has come to fix the constant drip in the toilet. Parking is terrible. Original garage is closed. Had to park on the roof. Horrible phone signal.
40,I was in Vegas for a bowling Tournament and I had previously stayed at The Luxor the hospitality and help from the workers there was and still were great. The restaurants and stores in the hotel are great. The location of the Luxor is cool as well! Always have fun when there.
20,If you can spend a little  More and go to a better hotel. Something is always  Wrong or not working properly- Tv toilet etc and thin walls you can hear  Your  Neighbors convos and dont get stuck next to  The elevator or  I’ve machine in the towers  If your a  Light  Sleeper
10,"Luxor Hotel & Casino    Las Vegas    Not Good-Avoid!    845731098    The Luxor is dirty and unkempt. Our hotel room was a one-bedroom king suite with a separate living area but the AC wasn't working on that side. We called 3 times within the first 24 hours only to be told maintenance had been there and serviced it. Finally by 9pm on that day maintenance was coming back again and told us there was lots of rust in the line and he had to flush it and all. Unfortunately it still wasn't cooling. We ended up checking out and going to Caesar's Palace for an entirely better experience overall. Additionally there were no pictures of the suite bathroom on-line and probably purposefully because the bathroom layout was terrible. There was no separate door or cut off for the toilet. Double sinks with no room between or around them to even put your belongings stand-up shower with no shelves for your shower things so you had to set them on the floor. The shower tub and floors were all stained. We asked for extra linen and pillows and were told they could only send up x amount. Any time we called guest services to check on the AC or to get something we were on-hold waiting for a minimum of 15-20 minutes and then we waited hours for the service. The toilet was loose from the floor. There were just so many things that were wrong that when you're paying for a suite you expect the minimums. We also rented a cabana at their pool on that first day. It was ""okay"". The pool had many bugs floating around and while we weren't bothered by it while there spending the day at Caesar's Pool put it to shame. The waitresses at the Luxor had their body parts hanging out whereas Caesar's wait staff at the pool wore tasteful bikinis. When ordering food from the waitress at the pool it took nearly an hour to receive it. We ordered one breakfast burrito when we first arrived. Overall we were happy to check out and go back to a place we knew wouldn't disappoint. We made this decision because we wanted to try somewhere else. Never again! If you want cheap and dirty on the strip..this is the place for you."
50,My trip was booked at a 5 stars hotel but a problem with the reservation done with my trip provider (Air Canada travel) obliged me to find another accomodation at the last minute . And i really mean at the last minute since i was left in Vegas without a room for my stay.. I booked at the luxor with the MGM application on the spot and they where very pleasant to deal with once i arrived at the hotel. The room was large and clean . The staff was impeccable and it is a huge property but quiet enough . I recommand that hotel .
30,I liked Luxor. The location is good the price is good and the staff were nice. They need to update the towels and furniture so there won’t be any stains. The check in process was a little confusing with picking the correct elevator to get on but we finally figured it out.
20,"Staff was courteous but our room was in very rough condition. AC barely worked in the main room stains on the carpet TV in sitting room didn't work shower doors swinging off the hinge bathroom sink clogged (slow to drain) bedding was aged ""all"" of the wooden furniture was scraped up frame around bathroom mirror coming apart miminal toiletries. Nothing about the room exuded class. It was like a roadside motel. Not what we expected at all. We only stayed one night at the facility so didn't want maintenance in our room all night. Otherwise I would have reported all of these issues.    By comparison we are currently staying in a TownePlace Suites by Marriott in Lake Forest CA. This is night and day. Clean fresh good service great bedding modern facilities.    I expected excellence or at least a quality experience from Luxor. Instead we got Joe's Roadside Motel level of service."
50,Very nice friendly and clean we loved the stay we will greatly stay again the casino needs a little more attention very poorly staffed I was never asked if I wanted a drink I had to ask someone myself
50,Very nice experience.  The room was clean the staff was friendly and a very short trip to the airport.  The steakhouse was really good and the staff and service was very good. They have one of the better pools and included a DJ with no extra cost.  They took away the mini fridges for some reason and that was a bit of a pain because I could not keep my leftovers cool. Other than that very good value for the money!
10,When we checked into our room the smell was so overpowering it gave us headaches. There was no morning coffee so a trip to the incredibly looooong Starbucks line each morning was as added cost for us. The pool was ridiculous with no shade or relief from the sun. Our room was hot and beds were not made are part of the daily maid service. I only feel lucky we got clean towels each day. Definitely not worth a second stay.
50,Our room as beautiful and the staff were very helpful and nice. Food was very good with many restaurants to choose from. Cocktail waitresses were nice and brought lots of drinks. Shows with mgm are very good also
10,The hotel AC went out in numerous rooms the TVs didn’t work and the check in process took almost an hour. The staff was not helpful. If you can stay at another hotel. I was not able to use my room for a day because the AC went out and only after numerous guest complaints did the hotel decided to change our rooms
50,I love staying at the LUXOR the only problems I have ever had is with my digital Key in the elevators and getting into my room. But the hotel is clean nice love it. The staff is helpful and nice. I highly recommend and will be back
20,It was 107 outside and the AC in the room kept turning off and never cooled the room down. They sent someone up to fix it and he said he couldn’t do anything until the next day and never came back. Won’t come back.
40,Good room for a good mid-week rate on the 21st floor of the Pyramid. The room was recently refurbished (new-wish carpeting and wall coverings) bedding comfotable and bathroom seems to have been recently re-finished.  The gaming spaces were attractively finished and food choices were good.
10,Blood on hotel room walls could feel the springs in the bed and the ceiling was leaking water and looked about to cave in over daughters bed! We let the staff know and all they said was they were sold out night 1 and we could try another room night 2 no apologies nothing as if it were normal! So gross!
10,Unable to resolve my early departure. We stayed for 5 days instead of the original 6. Unable to get composites for the day we didn’t stay in the hotel. Managment was busy so unable to help. From desk sets to file a complaint if I was that unsatisfied.
10,Hotel is very dated. There are nicer hotels. Food was not great. Air Conditioner went out in the room and they did not get us moved till 1 am in the morning. I think your housekeepers are thieves. We found our connecting room door open and had to relock it.  My $250.00 Oakley's are missing. Not a very good stay I am afraid.
10,Dogs barking is something normal at Luxor because the staff cannot do nothing about it because they charge extra to have a dog in the room.no one care how disturbing the dog barking to the other visitors  as long the dog extra charge is paid the rest of the visitors are on their own.  do not waist your time contacting any one about the problem because you lose more time on hold without any result they do not have any department or a representative responsible for barking dogs.  I will not comment more they say it is a dirty place I leave it for the visitor of Luxor to make their own decision. which i thing will not be better then mine.
30,Stop making hotel guest pay for parking it’s unreal to expect us to book a room wit you then charge us for parking. Everytime I would leave the park lot there was an issue wit the room key not wanting to work and then having to pay
50,I always have a great time at this hotel. This last time the beds were a little lumpy but it wasn't a very big deal for us. We were still able to sleep ok. I did love the layout of the room. There was a separate t.v and sofa in a living area that my son stayed in
30,A lot of smell of Cannabis no control around the rooms and poor customer service. Luxor locations is okay from the airport but from the other hotel are a little far when ppl have to walk out side with 104 F.
50,This was a great stay ! Location was good not to far from the strip honestly no point in leaving hotel since it has everything !!! Highly recommend going to a show went to the blue man group and it was a pleasure !
50,The staff went out of their way to handle my lost phone issue like it was their phone that was missing. It was retrieved from the elevator shaft after about an hour of it falling down to the basement... unbroken and still working! Thank you to Beth in security to making that happen!!
50,Very fun and gorgeous hotel! I definitely enjoyed my stay here! I will for sure be coming back the next time I’m in vegas and look forward to experiencing the spa and other dine in areas! Amazing hotel!
50,I arrived really early (945am) and my check in wasn’t until 4pm. I asked if I could just leave my luggage with them so I wouldn’t have to go back to my car and they were able to check me in early at no extra charge.
50,Great hotel again. I came last year and it was a blast. I have no complaints for this hotel. Looking forward to coming again next year hopefully. I recommend getting monorail tickets to explore the strip.
20,Poor daytime management rude Housekeeping rude/ Management at front desk daytime was horrible / Made me fill like problems occurring because of me with no apologies/ Should not be in Management as I am platinum status with MGM which is this level because I spend a tremendous amount of money at MGM property
10,We booked the large suite for my husbands 50th birthday. Room was 88 degrees due to ac units not working for 3 days we were informed by engineer that took 15 hours to cool room to 80. Very dirty room light bulbs out stains on ceiling dirty floors no ac filters on 3 units in room. Front desk stated they would comp our valet hotel tax and credit dinner that didn't happen as she basically says we have a ground floor room take it or leave it.... absolutely horrible service. The only good thing in the Luxor is Tendors steak house Andrew and David the Chefs were top notch! Almost surprised another great hotel hasn't grabbed them and given them the tools to do even greater things!
40,I have been in LV many times...but never at the Luxor. I was really surprised how nice our stay was. Also great Restaurants. I very much liked the easy access to the Excaliber and the Mandalay Bay Hotel.
50,This was our first visit to Vegas and we were upgraded without asking to a Pyramid Premier Queen Two on the 18th floor. Our room 18143 had a refrigerator which worked perfectly well and the lack of a coffee machine wasn't an issue as there was a Starbucks on the first floor by our elevator. Had an excellent view across to the airport overlooking the head of the Sphinx with plenty of space for the two of us to spread out and chill. The AC was good if a little noisy but understandable giving the outside temperature.  The food outlets we used (pyramid café the American sports bar) had very efficient service and excellent food.  We stayed from June 13th through 17th and judging by some of the recent reviews I'm wondering if 1. The hotel took a serious nosedive from the 18th onwards or 2. People go looking for stuff to complain about.  This stay was the first part of our 25th wedding anniversary celebrations held over from last year due to the pandemic and we certainly want to return one day.
50,Excellent service; Great price! Clean rooms! Can’t beat the price for what is delivered. Best night stay in a long time. We will definitely be sharing our stay with family and friends. Night and day difference from a few years ago to now. Great job!
20,Rude staff room had unpleasant Oder layout of hotel isn’t good long walk to most hotel rooms elevators are small and slow. Ate at diablos inside hotel service was ok but food was cold and after waiting 45 min for food after ordering we asked about the food not being hot and no resolve given
10,My husband and I were staying in the West Tower which is quite a walk considering that he's disabled and walks with a cane but we dealt with it. On the second day of our vacation there was a power outage that prevented us and several other patrons staying in that part of the hotel from gaining access to our rooms. We sat for about two hours waiting for Engineering to resolve the issue. During this time using the stairs in the emergency exits weren't an option because we were told that it was pitch black inside of the stairway. That seems to be a Fire and Safety Code violation. Once inside of our room we tried to relax and watch some television only to find out that the WiFi was down. No TV was to be enjoyed for that evening. On the third day after an excursion in 105 degree heat my husband and I returned to the hotel and couldn't get into our room. We went to the Front Desk to switch out the room keys thinking that this was the reason for the issue. It was not. We still couldn't get into the room so we returned to the Front Desk which is quite a walk from where we were to get some help. Front Desk Clerk Brenda placed the new keys in the machine to ensure that the keys were indeed working verified this fact and told us that if we had any further problem to just call Security and they would come to us with the master key and let us into the room. We returned to our room and encountered the same problem. My disabled husband who was now fatigued and in pain had no other alternative than to sit on the hard floor while I tried to get Security to come to us. I went to the hallway phone and dialed for the operator. I waited for an operator to pick up for fifteen minutes. No one ever did. What does happen is that a message loops about the entertainment offered at the Luxor. Because this wasn't an option I again went to the Front Desk and asked to speak to a Manager. Gavin the Line Supervisor came to speak to me and after telling him about my plight security was called to let us in. The master key from security didn't work so Engineering had to be called to replace the lock on the door and after approximately three hours we finally made it inside of our room. We didn't receive a new room or financial consideration for the price of our room as I requested from the Line Supervisor Gavin ( he politely ignored my request) but we did get meal vouchers. This is NOT what anyone should or would expect from a five star luxury hotel. It is subpar at best.
50,Been coming here for 20 years....Value priced luxury at the Luxor!! Great people..Great Food!!..Great shows!!..Came out ahead in the Casino...Saw 2 shows...Couldn't have been a better time!!...The staff was always warm and accommodating....A+++
30,The service I received when checking in was not good. The front desk receptionist gave me attitude when I asked her questions and she was hard to understand. The MGM app that I used to check in did not tell me my card was not working. Making me have stay in line to get help defeating the purpose of that fast check in from the app. I don’t like that I have to pay $15 for parking at your hotel everyday. Also we called guest services after we checked in and they told us that we had free parking after checkout for 24 hours. However we only had one hour of free parking after talking to the receptionist at the front desk.
40,It was our 29th anniversary get away just wanted to spoil the misses... very first time here and I guess I expected more never was asked why we were here but all in all we both had a great time there plenty to do...
30,We had no power for many hours. My room was one of the last rooms it seems that did get power. I was unable to meet my obligations and also to get ready for my birthday party without power to get showered and ready. My phone had no charge which made it impossible for me to call anyone because I didn’t have the phone numbers. My birthday was kind of a bummer and ruined all of our day plans that day. Also my Kodi water cup a tall teal color was suppose to be in lost and found and then I went down to pick it up and it turns out it wasn’t at lost and found like the desk person had told me.
40,The room was very nice but we stayed at the end of the building and the AC from outside of the building was so noisy. Also very disappointed they took the fridge and coffee maker out of their rooms. .
30,The room description is not as listed very over price what you receive this was the first time staying at this MGM property as I am a rewards member and enjoy all my benefits that I do and have received.
20,They had most of self parking closed except for the very top level did not inform anybody so there was no self parking even though they still charged you for it many people were forced to use valet parking which they still charge valet parking self parking and then when I looked at my bill charged for self parking again no staff would even listen or help resolve the issue. hey just didn't care they already had my money and my credit card number and were able to just do whatever they wanted.
10,Power went out for most of the day and everything from restaurants to elevators were inaccessible. Reservations were canceled. Plans were canceled for our last day there without accommodations or even vouchers. The on demand TV service would take your money but the rented items would not load and play. You could not call to be accommodated and staff seemed too overwhelmed to care. It sucked for everybody but the hotel wasn’t and isn’t prepared to accommodate you when your vacation is interrupted due to their bad maintenance and service. The walls are very thin also. We got one of the higher end king suites and we can hear next door when they’re talking on the phone. Every word! Made us uncomfortable to enjoy ourselves as a couple. The pool side also smelled of horrendous sewage!
50,Stayed here for a golf trip in Vegas with the boys. Hit the courses in the day time and was seeing shows in the evening. Saw Carrot Top and Fantasy. Both shows were great. Carrot Top is the best show ever.
20,The ac was terrible  And we did not appreciate that there was no refrigerator to store cold drinks! It was super hot each day and having to constantly buy new waters was annoying. We also wanted to be able to take leftovers to the hotel to have later that night and not having a microwave is super inconvenient.
10,We when to celebrate my best friend birthday when we do the check in We requested for an upgrade of our room because we wasn’t to get the penthouse or something better and the manager said no we were willing to pay the upgrade but he said no when the girl who was helping us and the front told us they have better rooms available and she came to talk to her manager she don’t even finish to explain and he said no 3 times
20,Inadequate air conditioning in suite. Very dated and uncomfortable room on the 29th floor. Wake up with bug bites that resulted in a major allergic reaction. My overall check in experience was terrible.
50,It was my Birthday weekend and I really loved my stay. No issues. I had a nice time. Thev room was very clean. The staff was professional and very nice. Very helpful when I asked questions. The front desk was very kind..
20,When we checked in we were not told that the power was out in a lot of sections at the front desk. When we went to go up to our room there was only one elevator working and a very long line of people waiting to use it. After waiting in line for about 20 minutes and barely moving we decided to use the stairs and walk up the seven flights with our luggage. When we got to our room it was really hot so we lowered the ac and went to get something to eat while the room cooled off. For the rest of that evening we used the stairs to go up and down because we did not want to spend 30 plus minutes waiting for an elevator. When we got back to the room the tv remote was not working so I called the front desk and they said that they would send someone to replace it and would take the daily resort fee off. Later on when we went down for dinner we heard people in line taking saying that they got the resort fee taken off and were given $25 food or drink certificates per person by the front desk. After dinner we went to check on the certificates and the lady at the front desk said that since we has the resort fee taken off that she couldn't give us the certificates. We told her that other people had received them and she asked us to give her those peoples names which we did not have. I was disappointed that we did not get our two $25 food certificates and others had. Not happy with this stay at all. I have another reservation for two nights in September but am not sure if I want to keep them after our experience this stay. I will update this review if they reach out to me to try and rectify any of this
20,The parking is the worst on Las Vegas Strip . . Not organized properly . . Very messy  Bad bad bad bad bad bad parking!!  Everything else is just great . . The best helping staff . . Great value  Fun place . .
40,The hotel is nice they just need to woork on the smell on the carperts. Also accommodations on the hotel services can inprove a bit more to help people have a better experience specially in the pool areas.
20,Rooms lack basic items - no frig no microwave and no coffee maker. If you want coffee you will need to go all the way downstairs and stand in line to get it. The elevator wait can be long and it was not uncommon for their to be a line. Rooms are cheaper then other places but customer service poor. Tried calling the front desk from the room and was left on hold long enough that I hung up. Check in was not much better. Long line and then when I asked if I wanted an upgrade I agreed to the price only to find out the only difference in the room was an air purifier. Positives are their breakfast place and pool. The pool is much larger than other hotels. I'm going to add Luxor of places not to go back to.
20,Room # 28058 and 28060 have no air conditioning switch rooms if possible. I called to have air conditioning fixed and no one showed up. Our dog friendly room alto had fleas. Not worth the money for a suite.
40,Love the fact there were food and entertainment such as showsexhibitions shopping and that you were able to reach other adjoing hotels such as the mandalay without exiting said hotels. Since traveling in june where the heat outside of the hotels can be quite a chore to walk a certain distance without having to seek some kind of shelter/shade
30,The hotel itself is awesome with all the statues and the atmosphere is great. We saw the blue man group during the stay which is a must see! The pyramid rooms are cool inside having the slanted windows. The rooms are a bit dated and in need of new carpet & etc. The worst part of our stay was discovering a huge cockroach crawling around the bathroom in our room. We were traveling as a family of 4 2 adults and 2 kids. Needless to say everyone was disgusted and it made it difficult to sleep worrying that there were more bugs crawling around. Also they charge extra to use the valet service.
40,Nice hotel. Good shows. The blue man group were fab. Expect long queues when checking in but staff helpful. The pool area lovely but if you want shade you have to pay for it!! Maybe they want everyone to have sun stroke??? The pub food was good.
10,The rooms and hallways at Luxor were dirty. Pools were also. Stains everywhere. Receptionist didn’t know what they were doing. End of my stay found out someone else’s rewards account was linked to my room… fraud?
30,Shower water flooded bathroom. No fridge in room. Mobile check-in was nice but guests had trouble getting digital keys and gave up. Otherwise clean room. Comfortable beds. Staff was friendly. Parking was good.
40,Room price good for the strip. Power outage problem for first 24 hours so had to go to another casino to play. Food court employees rude and didn't care if you so were there. Eat in the hotel. Their employees were great but pricey.
40,Clean room with necessary items for a comfortable stay. Comfortable bed nice view and location. Because of reasonable price there is no coffee in room no fridge (unless you order and pay) and no free parking. WiFi is sketchy at best. Online checkout was difficult. Housekeeping service was quick and efficient - a definite plus!    Despite these inconveniences the stay was pleasant and location very good. Price was reasonable and hotel better than those of comparable prices.
20,We rented a two bedroom suite that was in need of maintenance! It also needed a good cleaning. We’ve had better stays in the past wondering if they stop investing in the property to do something different in the future or it’s just poorly managed. Water stains on ceiling all over the suite cover on tub barely on and housekeeping not doing their job.
20,Moved rooms a few times in hopes of finding improvements. Although the staff was nice enough to move us each time the room quality did not improve. Rooms were dirty (Unvacuumed dusty something on the bed frame that I am afraid to elaborate on). T.V did not work in one room and the toilet continuously ran in another. The pool area was dirty and under staffed. We ended up moving to a different hotel after the power went out on the 2 day. The hotel was nice enough to refund our money for the unused days.
10,Petty staff members at the backstage deli  Who refuse to offer you a glass for water  Staff confused and not knowledgeable at all not willing to help buffet was the worst I’ve seen in Vegas hardly any variety and rude at the carving station
30,The hotel is great but are room was not. Shower design is horrible so water gets everywhere never got cold in room. WiFi and service and the wifi sucked so couldn’t use digit key card. Only thing good with the hotel was the blue man group
40,Definitely will be back. Diablos cantina was delicious!! Friendly staff and rooms were clean. Bed was comfortable. We also had an amazing view from our room on the pyramid side. Tram is helpful to get to two different hotels.
30,Elevators were filthy “stuff all over the walls and doors. There was a sewer smell outside by the pool. Seemed to be in the water in our room. Air conditioning wasn’t working but it did get fixed. Ice machine wasn’t working on our floor.
30,Not very clean rooms Service was okay . It’s in the beginning of the Strip! Lots of walking to get to other hotel Casinos . Very family friendly because it’s close to Excalibur Casino.  The Paradise Cafe was good!
20,"From issues with check-in to the classic brass elevators now being covered by cheap plastic ""gold"" sticker wrap this hotel is way past its prime. Our shower drain was so clogged that water started backing up immediately (maintenance fixed it after our first day but housekeeping should have flagged it during cleaning). There were dirty and dingy cracks everywhere (e.g. at caulk joints around fixtures etc). The wallpaper in the hallways was gouged and had multi-foot long rips in several places. This was substantially worse than a typical Holiday Inn Express..."
50,Price was unbeatable for such a beautiful hotel and casino. Staff was very friendly and eager to assist. Room was clean and spacious. Check in process took only a few moments and housekeeping cleaned our room throughout our stay.
10,I would never recommend to anyone to book this hotel. They completely invaded our privacy our room was so filthy it seems like all they did was make the beds nothing was cleaned hair toilet paper dirty ear swabs greasy counters ABSOLUTELY NOTHING WAS CLEANED.
30,Not sure if quality of the room is related to using reward points but there’s no fridge shower comes with half glass door bathroom ceiling was very low I read somewhere that daily park fee would allow multiple entry and exit daily but that was not the case. The quality has definitely changed. I mean it’s decent for family stay if you’re on a budget but
20,The people in the check in area is amazing but the rooms in the pyramid area needs a major update the elevators was in bad shape we have a nice view to the pool area our bathroom was dirty when we get there 🙁
40,Our trip to the luxor for our 5 year anniversary started with awesome check in process if you just download the app instead of waiting in line for an hour. One of the only downfalls is Luxor is located near the end of the strip so you are a good 1 to 2 miles from the middle so plan on taking alot of taxis. Food was average at best would suggest looking at other places for food.
50,We enjoyed our stay at the Luxor it was a very nice getaway. We had one issue trying to get resort credit on the account for use and the electricity went out. But the room was very nice the pyramid café was a delight and the pool was super nice.
10,There are a lot of hotels in Las Vegas Luxor is not worth staying at they will find a way to rip you off on the room level and never check out early!!! Recently I had to change plans and leave a day early so I informed them at 6:30 AM that I would be leaving a day early and they told me that I still had to pay for the room but they would discount the resort fee. I have never had this happen to me in 22+ years of traveling. When I objected I was told that is their policy and at that point what could I do I needed to move on.  So if you are going to Vegas look at other properties besides MGM properties; they are old and tired they only care about their room occupancy level whether your there or not. I stay at a lot of hotels this chain is not worth the frustration.
30,No in room frig or coffee makers.I would make it more pleasant to not always go down to the casino to get coffee especially since the Starbucks in the casino were closed as were some of the food places
20,Took hrs to get to my room and to get to the bottom floor. Had a staff member take me to my room as most elevators weren’t accepting my digital key even my physical key. Other than having to spend hrs trying to get to and from my room it was ok
40,Luxor is a nice hotel and you get what you pay for. The rates are very reasonable for its location and amenities. If you want nicer the Mandalay Bay is next door but will also cost more. The rooms were nice but nothing too grand but then again I took the cheapest. The gym was decent and better than most hotels. The pool was just a pool a little disappointing after being at the lazy river/wave pool and regular pool at MB. The interior Egyptian theme of the Luxor is pretty amazing and beautiful.
10,Room and facilities need deep deep cleaning. Also needs to work in their security past 10pm. A lot of homeless/drugged individuals like myself feel unsafe to walk around in resort. Definitely not family friendly.
30,My wife and I stayed here 25 years ago got married on June 26 1997 and LOVED staying there.. the nightclub (Ra) was amazing the fine dining restaurant (ISIS) was AMAZING (the name did not have the same meaning back then) and we enjoyed the amazing building .. what a shock to see so much with no shine or pride anymore.. I'm guessing since MGM took over they are running the building dry to knock it and Excalibur down for more moderns crap like Aria.. really sad.. Luxor deserves better...
40,I always enjoy our stays at Luxor it’s a friendly place with knowledgeable staff. I like that we can access. Mandlay bay as well as Excalibur.  I like to stay at either end of the strip that way I’m able to walk up n down each side of the strip from start to finish
10,Elevators falling apart floor lifting maintenance is a big problem. Needs a lot of work. Check the 15th floor elevator 2B section rail and you'll see how weak it is. If someone very heavy leans on it it's just a matter of time before an accident happens.
40,Chloe at the pool was amazing and fast and a very happy helpful lady. Wish the pools didn’t close at 7pm when you have so much more sun and people wanting to hang out in the pool to drink and visit with friends and family. So hot outside and staff and resort could make more money on guests staying cool on-site and not in the room or finding a pool open when it’s 115 outside and 90 at night.
10,This was an extremely disappointing stay. Our room was easily 90 degrees. We complained but they had no other rooms to move us to. A repairman came up to look at the A/C and it didn't get fixed. We woke up drenched in sweat both nights we stayed. It was miserable. The hotel itself is very old and outdated. The elevators were destroyed and super dirty. I would not recommend this hotel
10,The hotel was run down and had a terrible odor. The AC hardly worked it was over 85 in the room. I am a rewards member felt I receive nothing for my loyalty or gambling. Got stuck in their parking lot for 40 mins because gate was not working and was late to an important appt.
50,Stayed at Luxor for just one night just traveling through Vegas great service and clean rooms. The check in was fast and super easy check out on the app. Loved loved that it connects to other casinos through a walkway it was easy just to explore without having to walk so far.
40,I guess the river has been gone for a few years too bad.    Other than that I found my stay to be Stressless and relatively enjoyable. Not quite sure where everything was located but that means I'll need to come back again.    Danny
30,Probably a good hotel/casino but people always make the difference not in this case. Why overcharge? Is this a policy from Hotel or isolated cases where employees are responsible. Well overall hotel is good and I like it.
30,Luxor is one of the older not as kept up resorts on the strip and it shows.. corner suite was a pretty nice room but the overall experience wasn’t quite worth it.. self parking was closed so we paid $15 a day to park at Mandela Bay
40,The pool here is fabulous! Plenty of seating always available. The location was good within walking distance of everything we wanted to do while staying there. I’ve been in this casino before but had no idea that the hallways to the rooms from the elevator are open. So there is a “waist high” wall from which one (if one so desires) can look down onto the 2nd floor of the lobby/casino. I was unaware this was like this and as an acrophobe it was shocking and unnerving going to and from our room on the 21st floor! The inclinators were pretty cool a bit shakey traveling up and down to the room it was interesting. I’d probably stay again if I could be sure to get a room on one of the lower floors!
30,Luxor is nice and has decent amenities but there were roaches in the bathroom upon arrival and we experienced a power outage which was only on our side of the hotel. Had to take the creepy stairs from the 21st floor. No one from the hotel reached out about our inconvenience. Other than that rooms are decent and amenities and parking are decent for the price. No room service either
10,I was astounded at the poor quality of the hotel. The AC in the rooms didn't work properly the hotel had wallpaper peeling and broken fixtures every where. There was black out in the hotel due to lack of maintenance. The slots were down and we had to wait over an hour to get paid out. The list just goes on and on.
10,Room not ready on time even after checking in after 1600 hours. Waited over 25 min for help with luggage. Waited over 90 for luggage delivery to room. Horrible smell of marijuana on my floor on way to room everyday. Nothing VIP about a VIP cabana save your money. Valet always take a long time to drop of vehicles. Valet mainly working with machines outside only have two and one was always broken. Room smelled horrible. I can go on but not worth it.
30,Computer system is relied on too much. No actual inspection of rooms by supervisors. Shower has no pressure shower head too high. Received a small comp for Luxor only. Would’ve rather stayed at Excalibur.
50,From booking to checking in down to the exceptional customer service provided by the staff; we enjoyed our stay at The Luxor! The convenience of their food court was an added plus as well as their multiple Starbucks locations within the resort.
10,The worst hotel in whole my life. I’m staying here for 4 night but the Elevators tried to kill me two time. I don’t know what’s wrong with this elevators but they got to fix them for real. All the elevators are shaking and that’s scary. I’m glad I’m still alive cz today the elevator kinda dropped me with a strong and heavy shaking for a second I thought I was dying
10,Worst hotel elevators barely worked. Pool service was horrible electricity went out. Parking lot so full I had to park elsewhere . Group of 3. Tried to order breakfast but the server took 45 mins to get our drinks we ended up walking away
10,Power went down elevator didn’t work room was on the 25 floor had to use stairwell room was on opposite side of elevators. Room was dirty chair broken springs hanging out stains bed sheets had hole no mini fridge or coffee maker.
10,I extended a stay in Vegas for a night moving from the Delano (which was great) to the Luxor and I wish we hadn't. I can't believe the quality of one MGM hotel to the other was such a drastic downgrade. We checked in through the app and when my daughter and I walked into our room it was completely dark. No light AT ALL. It wreaked of cigarette smoke the towels smelled of smoke (which I didn't know until I took a shower). The hotel was sold out and we couldn't change rooms so I called for maintenance who hooked up a ventilator while we were at dinner and had housekeeping bring new towels. There were also 2 tiny little pillows on our beds so we also requested a couple pillows. We may as well have stayed at the Motel 6. Never again.
50,I stayed for two days in June. The room was ready ahead of time. The room was freshly cleaned with all toiletries furnished. The dealers were nice. The machines were clean. The buffet was wonderful. Check in and Check out was a breeze using the app.
40,Recently took a trip and must say the quality of customer services has gone downhill. I'm not sure if it's this entire COVID-19 situation that has caused this but after 25 years of going to this hotel it's finally time to venture out of there.
50,I love to stay here. The overall experience is wonderful and outstanding. Mgm resorts definitely takes care of its hotels. Love every time I stay here. I’m an mgm gold member and get treated like a noir!
50,Nice and clean rooms. The rooms are big and very quite and the view was nice we had the view to the strip. One thing we also like is that there is a lot of entertainment in the hotel to walk around also if you get hungry they have a food court oooh and Starbucks I think they have one in every corner 👍
20,Our air conditioner wasn’t working. Housekeeping had brought a fan in. Maintenance was up fairly quick after the front desk put a rush on the repair request. After it was “fixed” it did not get below 75 degrees. The room also smelled like smoke.
50,Our room was amazing and very clean. The details around the hotel are really cool to look at. The staff was friendly and we rented a daybed at the pool and they were so good to us. The buffet was good and full filling. I love Starbucks and one was down stairs right off the elevator.
10,The smell of marijuana was disgusting and the loud disrespectful people next door made the trip a nightmare. The place was a clean and price is good but I will never come back to this hell hole hotel to stay overnight
50,It was almost 10 years ago since I stayed in the Luxor been in vegas many times and stayed on different hotels but this one is the first hotel I stayed my first time on Vegas and the experience was the same as the first time I love this hotel and I hope I can go back in the future again
10,Hotel was okay little outdated rooms but clean and comfortable. The lifts are extremely slow and sound so old it’s quite a scary ride. For a few hours of our stay the lights on our side of the hotel where not working so we had to walk down pitch black corridors to the lifts and the rooms which was really dangerous and could have cause an accident. We was going to book the titanic experience and went to a help deck which is supposed to book shows for you and came across an extremely rude and ignorant staff member who was not helpful in the slightest she looked at us like how dare we ask her a question! Luckily we didn’t end up booking it as because the light situation the titanic experience had closed for the day so she could have potentially lost us $50. Overall experience I wouldn’t return to this hotel.
10,When we checked in the Rep. was extremely dry and rude. I asked her a question and she was quick to give a single answer without consulting mgr. Rooms were not accommodating- do not stay at this hotel.
50,It was a great experience Everyone must go to see for yourself awesome experience It was A long walk from the parking to your Room I also didn't like that I stayed at the west tower I didn't like the walk the set up how distant the parking garage was especially when you have many luggages
30,I believe I would have had a better experiences if after I arrived and checked in via the mobile app and the room assigned to me didn’t already have a guest in there. I was a little confused with how a that could have happened.
30,Overall stay was meh the elevators are super unstable it seemed like and the queen suite doesn’t feel like a suite just a bigger hotel room. Power went out and my family and I couldn’t shower and it got hot in our room quickly. Non the less I will never stay here again. Wasn’t worth it.
20,The how was out in half the hotel that included the food court. Our key only worked half the time. The bathroom was dirty. It was a very unpleasant stay. We will not be staying again.And It was our honeymoon
10,I had a reservation for two night that I purchased a few days before arriving. When I got to check in in the middle of the night the front desk told me I only had a reservation for one night. After showing him my phone with the two nights he was unable to pull up anything with the confirmation number but the took my money for the deposit. So I had to add another night which cost more money than I had purchased them originally for. It’s very annoying and upsetting that they could not even match the price that I had got the room for. The A/C in the room was also nothing strong enough to cool down the room.
20,I wanted to submit a short review but TripAdvisor required 200 words so here we go… day 1 I was underwhelmed with the outdated presentation and disappointed when I got stuck in elevator and “inclinator”… day 2 loss of power for 4 hours I had to rent a refrigerator… day 3 I adapted things got better… day 4 my wife found a dirty towel that had her makeup on it folded on our bathroom counter.
10,The Hotel was horrible in condition the power went out. I was told that I would be getting comps but I never received one comp. I stayed for 3 days and was (a) unable to use the television (b) unable to use the Internet (wifi signal was intermittent.) I came to do work and was unable to do so so I ended up having to go to the Mandalay Bay (Delaney) because the room was useless. Please refund the 2 nights and resort fee back to my credit card. Please have someone call me if you really care. ANDREW P LEHMAN Esq. - 713-903-9690
50,After reading reviews I wasn’t expecting much but I was pleasantly surprised. I’ve stayed at many hotels in Vegas and Luxor was not the worst. Room size was big and clean. Check in lines were long but I did it online which made it easy. The only bad thing about it is that you are far away from center strip!
30,The beds are not true queens. More like full size beds. The TVs are VERY bad quality volume was on FULL blast when you turn it on (it’s a default setting) no ability to plug in any devices because the remotes do not allow you to change the input settings. The walls are very thin and you can hear everything in the hallway (including elevators) and in the rooms next to you. There was a mini fridge but no coffee maker. The couch felt and looked dingy. Ended up asking for an extra sheet just so we felt comfortable sitting on it. Check in line was VERY long so we used the app. It was a little frustrating to use but it was better than waiting for the line. Parking is an issue. Not enough. If you leave at night don’t expect to get another spot and you will have to park at another hotel lot next door.
30,Our stay at the Luxor was alright. I loved the mobile check in option but the directions to find our room weren’t the best. The power went out in the hotel the first day we got there resulting in only one elevator working so the lines were very long!! Our air conditioner also wouldn’t stay on and our room never got very cool.
10,We are in Vegas at least 3 times per year and have enjoyed all of the MGM properties with one exception. The Luxor. We used the mobile check-in process which was fine but the lines to check-in or in our case to talk with anyone about our room was extremely long consistently. We were on the 14th floor right by the elevator and had water covering the floor and blowers running night and day right in front of our room which was outdated and really poor. The blowers were running for our entire 4 night stay. Couldn't get any assistance by phone so we just made the best of it.
10,We checked in around noon and got into our room and it was so hot and we turned the air all the way down and came back a couple hours later and it was still so hot in the room. We called the front desk and they said they would have a technician come up and no one ever came until we called again and then he came up 30 min later and he said that he couldn’t fix it. I complained at the front desk and he said that they do that so the AC units turn off after a couple hours to make the electricity bill cheaper. We checked out early and couldn’t sleep that night because it was so hot in the room. It was 84° in our room. We even thought about adding another night to our stay but after that I will never be coming back. That was by far the most uncomfortable sleep I’ve ever gotten. I will be writing a review about our experience. He even said multiple guests have complained so why not fix the problem? It is not like the room is cheap!
10,This had to be my very worst experience in Vegas yet. We always stay with MGM usually 4-5 times a year.    We chose to the Luxor this time due to last minute availability and their ability to accommodate our dog.    So many issues. First a dirty iron that ruined our garments. Then we were not able to use our resort credit because the guest previous to us kept showing up on our room. Guest services told us just to have the restaurants call them and they would handle it.    When we followed this direction the staff told us they “did not have time” to do that.    The casino floor went down during the middle of the day. I waited 70 minutes to be hand paid. When I ask to speak to management after being directed so the employee in the queue said it was not their problem and it did not matter.    After all of this terrible guest service I’m honestly considering giving up my status with mgm and switching to Caesar’s. Awful customer service and management. This place is a wreck dirty and I will never return.
30,"There were several ""hints"" that our room was not clean upon check-in. Found a mask under the pillow. Dirty drinking glasses and someones left behind clothes to name a few. Power went out so we had to take stairs to our room on the 8th floor using our cell phones flashlight."
40,Thursday 6-23 was spent trapped on the 19th floor of Luxor in my very nice spacious room with plenty of towels and great air conditioning. No elevators and no emergency lights in the stairwells if we wanted to walk down 19 flights.. .after 3 hours got downstairs. Tram service was still out and moving walkways turned off. Took the long indoor walk to Excalibur.
10,If you want to sweat insanely in the hallways and in the comfort of your own room at the Luxor then stay here. My bathroom door was even falling off smh. The rooms at Luxor are outdated and the AGT sign covers the windows of the room so you can’t see out of them.
40,The hotel was nice. Clean and not crazy loud. Parking structure was a mess and only had one side entrance open and only half of the bottom level was open for parking. Didn't get the room we booked. Booked a pyramid room. Called and said we were going to be a late check-in. Ended up in a tower room.
40,The premier rooms in the east-west tower are a great value for Las Vegas. Clean and modern the separate shower and tub are welcome. Only small negative I could see is the pools should be separated so that there is a designated pool and area for families with kids vs just adults.
50,One of the best value rooms on the strip if you get the upgrade - we got the room in the west wing and it seemed they renovated    Only complaint is they took away my freeplay which they always give me..
50,Excellent service all around. From the casino to the restaurants. The value of the room was amazing for the location on the strip and the proximity to the airport which is usually a big factor in where I stay.
10,Hotel guests smoke pot in bathrooms where air vents are shared with neighboring rooms making sleep room infiltrated with the smell of Pot smoked in your room. No compensation from Night Manager or Management at all. I felt treated like a non-existence hotel guest for a long stay.
10,Steer clear of this glorified motel 6. $60 per night would be a little high to ask for accommodations at this 'resort'. Absolutely nothing about it was nice. From check-in to check-out at least a hundred negatives I could point out.
10,Do not recommend this hotel for the following reasons:  1) Our stay was from June 20 -24th 2022 on date June 23rd elevator was not working me accompanied with guests from other rooms had to walk down from floor 17th hour was about 11am-12pm tried calling and no one answer service is bad.  2) The same date on June 23rd evening 11pm after returning to hotel my room was not cleaned this is not acceptable and called front desk and never sent someone within 15 mins and we have to sleep with uncleaned room bad...and the worst thing was i have two little kids with me never expect this from a 3.5 star hotel i don't think worth even 0 star. Front desk has all documentation of my request.  3) Parking lot is not free i understood however it's 10 mins walk from my room and there's no short cut i have two little kids staying four nights there were a nightmare walking from the parking lot. Routes had to be redesign and cut thru the swimming pool with access directly from parking lot.    4) No fridge and microwave at least fridge is a must if microwave is not allowed in so called high end hotel as a consumer i don't like to be forced to eat outside everyday    5) Never used the swimming pool because the hours are so limited 9am-6pm come on it's non-sense to swim under hot sun before 6pm and no one is going to spend majority of their best time 9am-6pm in the hotel this is ridiculous i would never ever go to this hotel again don't even want to mention their name to anyone.  I will go ahead and post all my negative reviews on google and all other social network and will not recommend any of my friends if Luxor hotel executive is not giving me a solution or at least a formal apology.
20,Booked a premier king suite for our honeymoon. This could be a really wonderful room but it was dirty and worn. Furniture chipped and broken fridge was broken off at the bottom revealing rusty metal furniture in lounge was dirty carpets dirty the spa bath was rusty round the taps sheets had imbedded curly hair then when changed were ripped in the middle and stained with brown splashes. The lifts were shaky and dented unclean and on a few occasions the floor was splashed with some kind of liquid all over. ( see photos)  The bed was comfortable but it was uneven and there was a gap between mattress.    We wouldn’t stay again when telling the staff they seemed to be dismissive and didn’t care. There’s better hotels in the same price range in a better place on the strip. Food options were few and expensive in the hotel while other hotels give a percent off food inside if your guests not here.
30,Clean hotel nice hotel for the cost however poor customer service made the small problems amplified. Soaking wet carpets in room TV problems broken elevators making crazy long lines to get to the rooms at peak times.
30,A dirty towel was hung up. No electricity for a day and no como for it. No fridge or coffee pots in rooms. The check in experience was very easy and I really liked that but the electronic key would glitch so that was a hassle.
20,Room was dirty. The carpet was extremely dirty and turned my feet pith black. The Bath mats were wet and had dirt on them like they had been used. Not enough staff to handle the number of guests they have on the weekend.
10,worst car rental experience ever.  No where to park when returning car. parking lot was full.  guest visitors parking in Avis spots very inappropriate  no Security on staff to assist.  spent 46 on valet  Avis never reimbursed
10,I checked in and I realised rooms had very low ceiling the room square footage is misleading as the inclined wall and low ceiling makes it look and feel way smaller. My wife was feeling claustrophobic.    Further as soon as you leave the room you will see a post apocalyptic prison cells with rows and rows of rooms - I don't know which genius designed it.    I had to checkout early (10 mins after checkin due the above issues) and I was not even refunded for next day booking even though I had insurance on the booking.
10,First off let me say I stayed at Luxor in 2018 and had a wonderful time. Since then I usually stay at Cosmo or Bellagio but I got an offer from Luxor with some incredible comps so I decided to go back. Bad mistake. Before I arrived I received a nice email saying I could check in with the VIP lounge. But the guy at the front desk told me it was closed that day (which was wrong) so I checked in at the regular front desk. The room they assigned me was in the west tower and when I opened the curtains a large slab of bird crap was smeared over the outside window. An omen of things to come. The TV in the living room never worked and the one in the bedroom worked on and off and totally died on my last night. Yeah I know. You don't go to Vegas to watch TV but I like having the TV going on my solo trips when I am in the room. I called the front desk and they said they put in a maintenance order but no one ever came. For some strange reason the room safe was put on a high shelf in the closet and if you are say under five foot ten you would issues using it. The water in the slower would take forever to get hot. The slots were incredibly tight! The only win I had the whole trip was at Mandalay Bay. What was truly awful was the buffet. I went during lunch and the food options were pitiful. They had plenty of taco shells but ran out of taco meat. Even the pizza was all dough. I choked down one plate and left. The one plus I can say is that the wait staff bartenders maids and drink girls are friendly and helpful. Please make sure to tip them well as they work hard. I'm sorry Luxor. I really wanted to like you but I will not be going back.
50,Came into Vegas for a quick stop over. Hotel was clean staff friendly and reasonably priced. Recommend spending the couple extra bucks for valet self parking was far away and confusing. The kids enjoyed all of the Egyptian decor.
40,It’s a great price and pretty great shape. The unique design of the hotel adds to the fun experience. It was a lot of fun to have a balcony overlooking all the action inside of the casino. My room was very clean with a lot of towels. The front desk staff and the staff stationed around the floor were extremely courteous and helpful.
20,No air conditioning or bathroom fan for first two days and no power to wall outlets for the last day. They did compensate some but I fell it should have been more. We had eleven people in our group and had five rooms there offer was to send us to the west tower away from our entire group.
20,Stayed at Luxor for sentimental reason quickly sorry we did. The hotel was very dated sections of parking were inexplicably shut down at various times cars broken into each night no security. Watched intox female dragged by friends thru hallway to elevators and we couldn’t find a single employee to report to. I security anywhere throughout stay. Room was clean but noise from highway/helicopters/airport was constant. WiFi and TV went down for a day no acknowledgement by hotel. Housekeeping staff talking very loudly in hallways each morning. Visited other hotels and the comparison was stark.
50,I always stay here because IMO it has the most character in the portfolio. This trip I took advantage of a few more amenities than I normally do including the pool and spa. Absolutely an experience you have to try!
30,If you use to staying at a high end hotel do not try. Rooms were great and clean but hallways to rooms scary dark and dirty.  Great food. It definitely has great pool but pool furniture old and broken.  Hot tub gross …  Because rooms were great we would stay there on a budget.  Casino is smoky  So if you don’t like smoke go to higher end hotel .  Blue man group was awful  But exhibits were great.  Because of it being budget hotel I thought at least food would be lower than most. Very expensive in evey restaurant for dennys grade food.  If your on a budget it’s fine.
50,Had a very nice stay overall. Stayed in the west tower floor 14 my only issue is the floor smelled like sewage…..other than that nice size room easy check in/out. Room service came everyday on their own…loved the bathroom. Nice size tv….I believe 45 or 50”
10,"Not very well kept and offer minimal service for your 40.00 a night ""resort fee"". We had a queen room in the pyramid and got stuck behind an elevator shaft so there was no view of the atrium as others got. The view from our window was of the Luxor tower. We booked a ""package deal"" with Allegiant air and couldn't be more disappointed. Got there after midnight on Tuesday but was charged a full day for Monday AND a resort fee. What a deal. The ""inclinator"" felt and sounded as it was going to plummet to the bottom every time we got on it. One day all the lights were out in the elevator lobby and security was using flashlights to guide guests. The hallway lights were out too classy!  the floors were filthy and the moving walkways worked about half of our 4 day stay  The shower has half a door and you need about ten towels on the floor or the water puddles on the bathroom floor. Who thought of that?    No amenities in the room except three bottles of some kind of body lotion. We were told we could rent a refrigerator if we wanted one. The safe was there but the batteries were dead so it was useless.    The shuttle from the airport (6 miles) was 30.00 on the bright side the cab back to the airport after checking out was only 25.00. Didn't these hotels provide free shuttles about 5 years ago? (Resort fee)?    Check-in was really long for the time of day we were there. They charged our credit card 200.00 for incidentals even though there is not a mini bar or any other amenities that we could be charged for. The 200.00 is supposed to be refunded (we'll see).    The food court is a joke 9.00 for a slice of pizza 9.00 for a domestic beer and 16.00 for a crappy sandwich. 5.00 for a bottle of water.    I realize these properties lost a lot of money during the pandemic but patrons shouldn't be punished for this. If you like spending money and not getting anything in return check into an MGM property."
10,People die there and the rooms were terrible dirty and they need more handicap parking The Valet charges too much. No handicap parking it’s too far ……………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………..
10,There are zero amenities in the room like coffee pot fridge or microwave it is run down and dirty wall paper coming off the walls floors are dirty shower only had a half door so water got everywhere while showering when I asked for a fridge for meds I was told I would be charged for it but after asking again and making it clear it was for medication they agreed To give me one then the man who brought it to my room was rude and seemed angry he had to bring it to me.
20,Honestly just awful staff besides 1 person that helped us at the end. Compared to the other rooms we stayed at this one was the worst for sure. And they won’t stop emailing me to fill this out. Annoying and can’t block it so here’s an honest review like you people wanted
20,My bf and I were looking for a relatively inexpensive vacation. Thought the idea of a pyramid hotel was cool. That’s where the “coolness” lasted. First the Pro: clean comfy room nice bed and pillows.  Now the cons: Rude staff poor restaurant choices no refrigerator or coffee maker in room. Starbucks line was always outrageous. No one really playing anything in the casino. Lousy location-too far from the fun casinos. Bartenders were EXTREMELY rude. Chose another hotel people.
40,Most things went as expected. Had a power outage that was not handled very well. I my opinion they need to really bone up on how to handle one next time. Was stuck in room for about 45 mins with no elevator working and lights out it stair wells.
10,There is a reason it’s proved so low. I was forced to change rooms due to the smell of sewage that got increasingly worse during my stay. Housekeeping staff entered my room even though I had the do not disturb sign hung.
10,I still recommend anyone staying at this hotel based upon the situations and I experienced and occurred this is my first time traveling since the pandemic and I saved a lot of money to go on this trip and I am just so upset that I had to deal with this chaos and I don’t watch this one anyone so please prepare prepared for power outages shaky elevators and complete disasters to occur at any given moment
20,Bad experience here. I won't be back. Front desk help is egotistical and just matter of fact with me when I told them I paid for a bigger room. They just wanted me away from their desk ASAP. Guess they weren't taught to use the system to see I paid the extra $140. Good Luck with your business.
10,Disappointed overall  this place is on the downhill I was criticized by staff workers they did not have any drink choices  only absolute vodka at the casino bar . my room was humid I was a hotel guest paying for parking Should that not be included with the hotel reservation? This casino dose not have any double deck blackjack or any card games where you get a human shuffle .  It sure feels like the card games are riged.  However craps game was fun and the Excalibur casino attached has better food choices which is just a few steps away.
50,We stayed at the Luxor with our family of 5. It was a really nice hotel in the south tower and the main area is really cool too. I would like if they had better food options but overall it was amazing for the price.
10,Was not satisfied with room at all I’ve stayed at Luxor before and had a nice room this was not a upgrade too me and the sink was stopped up the entire time I was there was not happy with room at all
50,Rooms are nice. Clean quiet. Bed is comfortable. Room cleaner was excellent and very helpful. Some of the staff in the casino and the cafe was rude and made you feel like they were having a bad day...
40,The location was great. Room was very clean view was awesome lots of entertainment. Mulitply restaurants is in the lobby. The spa staff was very polite and friendly. Didn't win any monwy on the slot but havena variety of games.
50,We were placed in the tower complex just a short walk from the pyramid area. Rooms were clean spacious no noise from the casino and air conditioning was superb. I cannot have a single complaint about the room the casino the complex or the staff. Having stayed at other mire expensive Vegas hotels I will definitely stay here again. The pool area was also spacious and easy to access.
10,Multiple issues with our room i.e ceiling coming down due to a water leak toilet was leaking and AC didnt work in the bedroom. We had to bring our mattress from the bedroom to the living room so that we could sleep in a cool area.
40,It’s close to MGM Grand and cheaper.  Staff is friendly. The pool feels good and the dealers are very helpful at explaining games. Not a fan of eating breakfast there. Lunch and dinner are good. The body exhibit is good.
40,I’ve stayed at Luxor 5-6 times in last 5 years. It’s always been a decent stay. Not perfect but close. Main reason I like it there is you can go between Luxor and Mandalay without going outside. You get 2 casinos to play plenty of restaurants and shows between the 2 hotels without taxi/Uber .
10,You get what you pay for I suppose. Very disappointing hotel staff rude and not interested. Lots of table games in the casino closed. Staff slow to deal with issues and made it appear an inconvenience when approached about issues. Pool had blood on side and when life guards made aware did nothing to clean it up. Hotel had a power cut (not there fault but) and staff had no idea how to manage. Hotel lifts are dated and slow. Rooms were spacious and comfortable though. Would only recommend the Luxor if you were on a tight budget and only as a base.
50,The stay was nice room was clean and gorgeous. I loved the pool and it was in a nice area. My only problem was having to pay for self parking. We did have a little problem with check in but the guy who checked us in gave my family and I $25 dining credit per person
20,Hotel is very dark dingy and dirty. And the room had a funky smell I can't put my finger on. It wasn't cigarettes or a boozy smell but it was nasty. Rooms weren't very clean and overall the hotel was just not worth the price.
10,Upon arrival I was greeted with a long check in line so I took advantage of mobile check in. When entering my room on the first floor I immediately noticed the beds appeared as if they had just been laid in and had stains on one set of sheets. There was food debris from the previous guests still on the carpet. I needed to shower so I went to the bathroom which appeared clean until entering. There was gooey residue on the tiles and the shower had so obviously not been thoroughly cleaned. I was disgusted and walked to the front desk to voice my concerns but was told I would have to wait in the long line to do so. Instead I gathered my belongings and checked out. I will not be booking a room here again and would have appreciated a standard level of cleanliness for the amount paid. Instead I left within an hour of checking in and made the long drive home disappointed and upset.
50,No problems except the rude and laziness of the luggage staff He seemed to be lazy…just slouching over anything he could that would support him…then when asked a question or 2 he made it seem like we were bothering him …the lobby was very nice and clean..as were the restrooms and our Hotel room…
10,"my stay at the luxor was not one to remember. staff was very rude to me and my friends and was told ""to have more common sense"" because we could not locate the east wing because the sign is a little hidden and was previously told to go somewhere else. was placed in a different room than what was reserved. management was spoke to about all occurrences and nothing was done to resolve."
10,Will never stay here again. No air conditioning for most of our stay. No hot water in the shower and our last day we had no power. We had to leave the door open to get light in the rooms because we could open our shades because it was already so hot in our room.
30,"The room was nice but there are no ""extras"" I usually find on my travels (no microwave or even a refrigerator to keep drinks cool). The walk to the elevators from the casino floor or the entrance by Valet was really long. They have an art area that would have allowed us to bypass quite a bit of the walk but it was closed off and had signs up saying private party. We avoided going to our room as much as possible to keep our energy for walking the strip Fremont St and the casino rather than to our room"
50,It's not the fanciest nor is it trying to be but rooms are nicely updated and maintained and the amenities are great. Good dining choices even for late night/early morning. Casino is fun and great sized. Lots of energy and fun. And if that's not enough you can head to Mandalay Bay/Excalibur/NYNY/MGM etc close by. We've stayed here many times and will continue to do so!
50,It’s legit the best value in Vegas. It’s not too expensive it’s just as nice as the other big name Hotels and and Casinos and it’s at the end of the strip so it’s not as busy all the time. It’s the only place I’ll stay at!
50,During my stay I felt completely safe I saw security staff at the pool at parking lots and all around the facility which made me feel confortable.  There were plenty of life guard at the pool area for my kids to enjoy their time.Each time I asked any of the staff for assistance each and everyone of them was knowledgeable and friendly even thought they were busy doing their work.
10,I stayed at Luxor for a business trip in June 2022. It was a windy night (winds of 25 mph) . Once I got in the hotel room at night aiming to get ready for sessions the next morning I heard loud wind noise from outside. I was on the 13th floor and with that loud noise it felt the room was going to get blown away taking me with it. I called the help desk around 9:30 pm they said they will send someone to look at it (couldn't give me another room as it was all full) - no one showed up and after 1 am at night I had to go to the front desk in person and ask them to send someone to look at it ASAP. The technician came within 30 min showed me couple of vents that needed to be closed. Closing the vents did help some with the noise - it didn't completely go away but it wasn't scary as before.    The rooms are dated the windows need to be perhaps replaced and A/C in the room itself is super loud. The wind sound was even louder than the A/C noise itself.    I will not stay in the pyramid part of this hotel again.Not sure if the other parts of the hotel was more updated.
10,8 day stay. 2nd day in Luxor we were victims of theft while out of the room for less than an hour. MGM Luxor staff Management could have alleviated some of the issue but did nothing. No comps no assistance just a security report with no response. Customer service for MGM has deteriorated from what was once a great resort experience. Extremely frustrated considering the $$$$ we put into their resort.
40,I had planned to come to Las Vegas for my 40 years Class reunion all the way from Illinois. So I choose Luxor Hotel because I thought it was a beautiful Hotel. And I like the location and love the lobby it was very clean.
50,I love the Luxor Hotel and Casino because of the friendly staff numerous eateries and expansive Casino that is within The Luxor as well as the in door connection with The Excalibur Hotel and Casino and The Mandalay Bay Hotel and Casino.

20,In general there's a lot to enjoy about Luxor. The convenience of their theater where we watched AGT the restaurants the pool were all great. But I was disappointed about how dirty and stained the accent chairs were the stained bed sheets absence of refrigerator and the terrible parking. Nobody monitors their parking lot direct guests when they are full and allow countless cars circle around endlessly to the point of giving up while another bottom floor of the parking structure is closed for access even though you can see several parking spaces available.

20,The rate seems cheap but there are no amenities and it’s old outdated and dirty. We were treated better at other casinos we went to! They don’t even offer free water bottles. Staff seemed friendly but casino waitresses were nowhere to be found. Pay the extra and stay at a better resort!
10,Do not take your family here. The rooms are very clean and pleasant that's about it. I think I contracted about 800 forms of hepatitis walking through the casino floor to check in. We spent as little time as possible outside our rooms if we were in the hotel.
20,amazed no coffee machine no fridge air con cannot be turned off and as its raining out side not needed it's far to big to be a good hotel 2 nights here not looking forward to it 1st impressions not good
40,Very nice hotel speedy check-in on a mobile app. Great amenities large pool area and casino. Digital key card has a few issues (no cell service or WiFi in the elevator). The room and bathroom was beautiful although cleanliness was a major concern.
40,All was well but booked next to housekeeping. Horrible ………………………..………………………………………………………………………………………......………………………………………………………………………………………………………………….
50,From arrival at valet to checkout all employees capable friendly and helpful. Clean facility throughout wonderful restaurants - Tender is the BEST Steakhouse in Las Vegas Super Pool service Casino fun and ample cocktail service!
20,My towels were still dirty and i had to go out and buy my own. Was charged for room cleaning and a pool i never used because it was always closed or closed early. The only good thing was gus helping out and being amazing at the front desk.
40,The Luxor is a nice place friendly staff and very clean and the ease of access to other properties is a nice touch. Restaurants on site had good menu's and reasonably priced. I found the gift shops and convenience stores to be a little pricey on everyday items though
10,BEWARE! BEWARE BEWARE! My son noticed that the peep hole in the door was turned backwards in other words anyone from the outside of the door can peer through the hole and CLEARLY SEE INSIDE THE ENTIRE HOTEL ROOM. When looking further I noticed many rooms were the same! I touched the peep hole on the outside and it fell apart. Someone has turned them all backwards to watch people in the rooms! I’m horrified! We felt very unsafe and totally creeped out! How very dangerous! We taped up the hole and left early the next morning! NEVER EVER AGAIN! There are thousands of rooms where people will not watch you in your room!  At 7:00am we were suddenly awaken by a banging and screaming at our hotel room door. A man was trying to break into our room looking for a woman named “Brittany”. Banging and banging and screaming. We were terrified and called security no one came up! No one ever even called to check on us! Needless to say we packed up and left. As we were walking out of the room a few hotel security were in the room next door. I asked about the man screaming and banging for Brittany. They said she was in the room next to ours but no more! WTF? Did she leave in a body bag? OMG please do yourself a favor and NEVER STAY HERE!
50,Great Friendly and quick check in and check out. Nice room clean and smelled great as soon as you walk in. You'll be satisfied with this stay. Can't go wrong with your stay at the luxor. Highly recommend.
30,Too much money for too little amenities. The city that never sleeps the pool closes at 6 PM. Room without coffemaker frig or microwave. Closest place to get coffee?? Starbucks and the lines are always ridiculous.
20,Parking is horrible. They only have two levels and it is always filled. I have to parked at Mandalay or Excalibur and walk over. They should give guests that stay there first priority. Then customers service is not that friendly. Overall parking is my main problem.
40,Good trip 1st time at the pool awesome service good fitness room too..love the stay food court was nice did not get a chance to see the shows..but seen blue man group a year ago very good show next too see would be the Titanic museum been too tacos- n-tequila very good margaritas and good food recommended
10,Hello    We had been looking forward to this trip for months. Here are just a few things that left us less than happy on our vacation and choice of your hotel.    ROOM ISSUES:    1. Upon digital check-in through the app I noticed that the room I had reserved had been changed. I waited in line and was notified that I had been downgraded because the suite that I had reserved was no longer available. I was not notified of this in advance. I was offered a $100.00 food credit on my account by the front desk girl. I asked to speak with a manager and after a 20-minute wait he came out and was less than accommodating and was basically rude. He finally said he located a suite that I had reserved and said it was the only one available. He then offered a $75.00 credit instead of the original $100.00 that the girl offered and when NOTE: I did not receive the $75.00 credit as promised on my account.    The room was very dark NO VIEW and it overlooked a loading dock. There were towel racks broken off and sitting on the luggage rack in the bathroom. The velvet couch had seen better decades and the velvet fabric on the cushions was stained and torn. The furniture in the room had scratches and damage throughout the living room and bedroom area. The furniture looked like it was compiled from a variety of other hotel rooms and it was awful and smelled of mold.    Both TV's remotes did not function properly and the wi-fi did not work for more than a few minutes each morning and evening. The wi-fi speed when I checked it was less than 10 % of what it should have been.    Calling the front desk for assistance was pointless as I would remain on hold for 30 minutes at a time and after three attempts to get assistance waiting on hold with no answer I finally gave up. Sometimes they would pick up the phone and hang up forcing me to call again.    There were smelly trash bags and (diapers) from other rooms left strewn throughout the hallway near our room and left there all day and overnight.
10,Suite was not clean. Bed was not comfortable compared to other hotels.  Elevators seemed to be breaking down and made us sick from shaking and jolting.  Not a good selection of food. Waitresses did not come ask for drinks
10,Had to move rooms two times because the AC wasn’t working in the pyramid. We got moved to the East tower the first room smelled horrible but the second was really nice. The staff on site wasn’t very helpful but the manager I spoke to on the phone was.
10,They broke into my car while parked at the paid self parking although they have a lot of security cameras and unusual security personnel disrespectful and racists they're telling me that they're not responsible for breaking my car window and stealing stuff out of it be careful don't book there on top of that my check-in experience was terrible because they tell me self checking on the phone is easy it's why don't believe him they'll waste your time
40,Overall stay was great - comfortable rooms clean facilities friendly environment. A little outdated and not as many amenities shops etc as some of the hotels on the strip but very happy with the stay!
50,The pool was great the casino was fun! We had a great time!! The room with the big tub was sooo great! The view was amazing can't wait to come back again! The rooms are pretty nice they are mostly updated
30,While I enjoyed our stay the Luxor is themed everywhere but the rooms which makes no sense. The staff at the mgm rewards desk was rude and never answered my question and talked down to me. I ended up gambling at South point because I was treated like a second class patron because I was on a comped room which I earned via mgm credit card and gambling. My money is good just like everyone else.
10,"Do not stay here. room not available. had to fight to get the room we booked. waited 4 hours past check in time for room. door broken and had to wait on maintenance. they offered no other ""comps"" for inconvenience. we will never stay here again."
10,The beds were terribly uncomfortable. I almost ended up trying the floor. No microwave coffee maker or fridge in the room. Heard dogs barking all night left alone in a room I am guessing while thier owner was out all night.
40,Tower rooms is really recommended when you stay pretty good deal with mgm rewards and step up from Excalibur. Pretty decent games to play but thankfully there’s a bridge to Excalibur if you want to play more games
30,Only option available when I booked for a conference. Never stayed so we decided to try it. We stayed in the pyramid and the room never stayed cool. TV remote did not work with the TV which we told them about but was never fixed. Mattresses need to be changed. Sleep quality is not was I expected for a strip hotel.
10,Room ac was messed up the first night woke up in a pool of sweat took 2 hours to get into another room the next day. That room was dirty and had pet hair everywhere on the carpet. My son had to stay in my sisters room because of allergies to the pet hair.
30,At 1st glance the hotel looks nice .. the room is clean .. my problem is the fan in the bathroom wasn't working and 2 of the bulbs are out .. also only 2 electrical outlet in the room work properly to charge my phone. Parking is horrible only open the top level parking while the lower level are empty .. it's 110 degrees in Vegas any given days and they let your car fried in the sun .
50,Spacious modern clean rooms that smell nice upon entry. I was extremely satisfied from the moment I checked in until the moment I checked out. I will definitely be going back to stay. Only negative this hotel has is it's location. Gotta walk a little to the strip.
10,Room was nice and big for the price but on the first night the toilet overflowed while I was gone. There was waste water all over the floor and soaking my clothes. Ruined my night and the trip really.
30,They force you to buy drinks and water at the pool for ridiculous prices. Hotel was dirty elevators are hard to find. Fire alarm set check in. No staff member seemed to care. Overall far end of strip. Lack of dining options. Stay at Mandalay bay
40,Nice place clean rooms. Worse thing for me is they don’t sell Diet Coke. We enjoyed our stay. Got in the pool rented a cabana. I would recommend Luxor. The buffet was just ok nothing special. We requested late checkout with no problems
10,You want to get your car broken into after you pay for parking go ahead and park it at the self parking and they will not pay to fix your car and on top of that racist security had my car parked at the south parking overnight came in the morning they broke my window and they stole stuff from a car I called security they won't even honor to get the car fixed after I pay for parking and they have ton load of cameras and useless security personal
40,Enjoyed our stay. One thing. Took part in the Pride bar crawl. Lack of effort was put into it. Very disappointing drinks and gift. I believe it you provide an experience it should be as good as it can be.
50,Everything was excellent! The service from employees cleanliness of the room the cabana we rented for the day. All in all our trip was fun and we felt safe and was exactly what we needed some time to relax and get a way from it all.
10,I will never stay here again and will definitely make sure to pass that to on to anyone i know coming to Las Vegas..  Do you really want me to type 117 more characters about how horrible the hotel room was the elevators are trash and if your room isn’t right next to an elevator have fun getting a full tour of your entire floor everytime you want to leave…parking garages are tiny and full up EVERY NIGHT so also enjoy the full tour of the Excalibur or Mandalay Bay cause that’s where you’ll be walking from to get back to your room.. But don’t try to use the pools over there the keys only work at other mgm properties when It is convenient for the casino properties
30,"At check in i was given a room where there was housekeeping currently cleaning. We checked in extremely late after 1am due to a cancelled flight. We were tired my wife especially being 7 months pregnant was ready to lay down and get rest. We were told by the housekeeper to ""just wait until she finished cleaning"" We went back down to the lobby to request another room it took us a little while but we were given another room. It was just a big inconvenience that the desk clerk checked us into a room that was in the process of being cleaned and we had to go back down to the lobby to correct the issue. Not something we wanted to experience after a long day of traveling."
20,The staff completely a mess they were rude very dismissal and inattentive  They didn’t care for your well being as they should’ve. I honestly felt that I was wasting my money at that location. The beds were old and worn out. My back hurt so much like I wish I would’ve just sleep on the floor instead of them beds.
40,This is good place to visit but the decorate was a little bit dated and their was no refridgerator in the room. The overall the room was fine and comfortable. Would probably look at another property to stay at since half the resturants closed like super early has well and no room service for food.
10,Found bandaid in my bathrom. Found dead skin and dust on the head board side of the box springs and behind the bed when i dripped my phone and had to move the bed.i had to pay for an upgrade when the room wasn't clean.
30,Went for a friends 40th birthday where half our group of 10 stayed at Luxor and the other half in the excalibur. The walk between hotels was ok except half the moving walkways were down. The elevators were super slow and a few of them never worked so line ups were long. I was using elevator 1B in the corner and it always had a line up to get up. The air conditioner in my room was down half my trip and my sleep suffered because I was too hot. The bathroom has water damage to the wallpaper from built up moisture. The pop machine ate our money on 2 different floors. We went to temptations Pool party and bought the halo daybed which came with a server. She was good at the beginning the. The rest of the day we had to keep flagging her down or asking another server to take our order. For how much we paid for the daybed drinks and food she should have been been more present. Possibly they need more servers? Overall it was just ok. I had a comp room through the mgm rewards so I would only stay if it was free again.
50,Stayed at the Luxor with the dad for Father’s Day. Didn’t hit the casino because there aren’t any $5 blackjack tables but the trip was incredible. The steakhouse was pricy but 10/10. The Gouda Mac and cheese is life changing. The two bartenders there also crushed it.    Rooms were clean and the AC was great. Doesn’t bottom out like a motel 6 at 73 degrees. You can make it colder than minot.    Military accommodation is really great. Huge discounts and the VIP check in is great even the mobile app is fast. I personally like physical cards because every time in Vegas my phone dies app doesn’t account for that.
10,We went for father's day weekend and the moment we walked in the Luxor it was not good. We upgraded to a suite and it was filthy crumbs on window seal fingure prints all over the place on headboard table tops and fridge was with crumbs. The movied us to tower eo which was clean but so hot we called 4x they sent 3 different people to fix but filtration is no good in the room. We were sweating all night for 2 nights and tv goes out while watching a movie. They were able to fix T. V.
50,I was pleasantly surprised with all the chaos going on the staff was exceptionally great. Even the folks at the surrounding Starbucks were amazing. The pool staff was amazing as well. I wish I could have stayed longer.
30,There was no fridge or coffee pot with complementary coffee or tea no informational packets for things to do and worst of all the parking garage is a nightmare to get in and out of. Takes 20+ minutes to get out. Disaster.
30,The elevators were an experience. The wait was at least 5-10 mins for an elevator there’s one elevator per area of the hotel they went past my floor and back down to the stop. Then the valet took entirely too long to retrieve my car
10,We upgraded our room and it was the biggest issue EVER. I spent more time with the front desk or on the phone with customer service than I did trying to enjoy my vacation. That was our first and last time at the Luxor.
10,Dirty place. Condo in room. No fridge. 1 elevator. 12 minute walk to room. Requested disabled per my doctor's orders. Denied. Notifying bbb and ADA. THIS PLACE SHOULD BE SANCTIONED. LOUSY WORTHLESS CORPORATE JUNK AT ITS FINEST.
30,Nice architecture. Very cool theme inside and out. Wish they offered room service. It’s a long way for a quick snack. Pool was very low key. No music. It was also very shallow. I believe it was only 2.5 foot.
10,Hotel policies do not allow staff to provide great service. 4000 plus rooms. 1000 parking spaces. During our stay they closed half the self parking lots. This forced everyone to valet where they tried to get $50 premium just for parking. It gets worse from there. Avoid avoid avoid.
40,My daughter and I stayed for 2 nights and enjoyed our stay. The hotel has everything that you need friendly staff and connected to the Excalibur and Mandalay Bay. We stayed in the west towers and had a decent view.
30,Riding an inclinator elevator is a new experience too bad it is in poor condition room was very fair and good space on more windy days I could hear inside the room. Would have more signs and indication of hotel facilities as the bus Plaza.
10,An absolutely incredibly bad experience.    First of all the hotel feels dated and worn. Apparently there is no effort made in keeping the place up to standards. The casino and restaurants where up to date clean and friendly.    However the stay in the hotel was downright awful. The AC didn’t get the room below 25C. Switched rooms in the middle of the night. To find the new room AC didn’t work either. The rooms didn’t get cleaned we were offered another room but that meant another change for only one remaining night so we passed. The hotel offered some compensation but because of the lack of sleep at the hotel it ruined our stay in vegas as we were absolutely shattered.    Gave the hotel plenty of time to sort it. But nothing done. The stay was completely ruined by the hotel. Shame. The other hotels (even from the same MGM group) seemed far more modern clean and outright better.    We will not be going back.
40,Rooms were clean and comfortable. Beds were great. Elevators can be a bit of a journey to get to. Location is ok and the pool is fine. Only issue is they blocked off parking in the shaded portion of the garage for some reason and the timeshare people can be overbearing and annoying
40,"Inexpensive place with Clean and Comfortable rooms. No ""Wow factor"" but comfortable. Its a bit south of the main Vegas Strip area but the tram helps to get you to walking distance of the shops. If attending a conference at Mandalay Bay it is close enough to walk."
40,Had a room on the 14th floor of the tower. Room itself was very nice but the windows were covered by the ad that was covering the building so didn't let much sunlight in. Room was also facing the pool so the music from the pool could be heard pretty easily.
50,Once you find the elevator you’re supposed to use this hotel is great to stay at. There is so much to look at a lot of good food options and a lot of shows to see just in the hotel itself. I’d recommend staying here.
30,Poor room quality. Room had mold/mildew beat up furniture and peeling ceiling. Also had no cellular coverage. When I called to complain I was told that the hotel was completely booked and that nothing could be done.
50,I had a 4 night stay at the Luxor and it was a great experience-from check in to check out. The beds were very comfortable and my room was very clean. If you stay please try Tender steak house it won’t disappoint absolutely delicious!
20,The Luxor was our first casino visit back in the day. The Luxor has a certain place in me and my wife’s heart that started our many reoccurring trips to Vegas over the next 20 years. Although not all our visits were at the Luxor every time we came with Vegas newbies we would take them to the Luxor.    The Luxor has always played second fiddle to its other MGM brother and sister properties in Vegas but always really tried to keep up. This meant good service and a nicely maintained hotel for the price. Nowadays the Luxor isn’t even in the orchestra anymore. This place has lost any identity as a Vegas hotel and has just simply slipped in quality.    The ONE quality thing that has carried on over the years is the staff. They are so very kind and really do try to provide good service. However they are doing so with their hands tied. The way this property is run they just aren’t made to succeed.    The bell hop service was impeccable from check-in to check-out. After we checked our luggage in with them we drove to the Self-Park to park my car. This is where we spent AN HOUR trying to park our car. What used to be free parking is now paid parking. Whatever but they were only letting cars into the upper deck. Turns out it was full. An enormous line of cars were logged jammed in there trying to pay to get out and a huge line of cars were stuck in there just trying to find a place to park.    After spending an hour playing parking roulette we finally parked the car. We were checked in with their mobile app. This app is flawed on so many levels. I couldn’t tell if they expected us to use the app for elevator access and room access but here’s the answer. Don’t. We spent 4 trips up and down the elevator with it not working. Luckily someone got on the elevator going to our floor. We got to our floor and our room. After several attempts I finally got the app to open up our room. We walked in and the AC was busted and there was water on the floor.    The front desk sent us to another room. Now I learned to print room keys from the mobile check-in at the front desk?? If this is what they wanted you to do in the first place that was not made clear in the app.    The keys worked for the elevator and our room. So again what is the app for??? Anyway my wife needed a fridge and freezer for her medication. The front desk sent us a fridge and told us to speak with the concierge regarding a freezer. The fridge arrives. We call the concierge. They said they have fridges with freezers and the front desk should have sent that to us. “No problem we’ll send that up to you right away.” An hour later the poor maintenance guy shows up with even a smaller fridge but no freezer. We explain to him what we needed. He finally understood and now makes a third trip with a fridge with a freezer.    Our room was tired and worn out. Although clean it desperately needs serious upgrading. The shower oddly leaked all over the bathroom floor. I’m not sure how because it was a shower door not a curtain and it was closed.
10,Staff were great. My room didn't get cleaned sometimes though. Beds were old and worn in. Weed smell at nearly every entrance and you could not find any place nearby to eat on a Saturday after 10PM other than the Market or the 24/7 gas station across the street.
30,The parking was Allright but unfortunately for us it was being remodel so we had hard time finding a space and we where charge 15 per night per car on our reservation... Room where good size.. pool staff was not nice...
50,Clean reasonably priced rooms close to Conference at the Mandalay Bay and easy walk to fine dining stores and entertainment.  Everyone we encountered on the staff were friendly and extremely helpful.
40,I am tech savvy but their app lacks major directions and is missing critical components. All I can say is Hilton hands down beats them in this area.  Frustrated and tired is not two words one should be mentioned in a simple check in.
20,Rooms were clean and serviced daily…Huge Plus! Wait Staff and Clean Staff were SUPER nice and attentive. Vegas is WAY expensive ($20 for double Jamison & $8 for a Diet Coke???) and then they tack on RESORT FEES??? Also room lacked a coffee maker or refrigerator though you could request these items for an addition fee!.. Disappointing! Sickening smell of marijuana at every turn despite signs stating how ILLEGAL it is to use the drug on the propery! Expect to hold your breath in the parking lot at the pool and outside every door…. We cut our vacation in Sin City short for these reasons.
50,I had a wonderful stay at the Luxor during a business conference. The staff was friendly and helpful. The hotel room was nice and clean. The food at all the restaurants were delicious. Great first experience in Vegas!
30,We were only here one night as we had reservations elsewhere for the remainder of our trip. For the price the room was decent. It was a tower room which was a bit disappointing as we were hoping for the “Pyramid” feel and that was not the case. The common area were not very busy but appeared to be well maintained. A nice variety of shops and restaurants. A bonus is the fact that you can get to both neighboring properties that are attached.
50,I love the Luxor! The nightlife the ambiance and the staff are out of this world! My husband and I have stayed at every hotel on the strip and are always disappointed we decided to stay somewhere other than the Luxor.
10,Our room was around 90° in it when we checked in and since it was over 110° that day it just couldnt recover since it was turned off completely all day long. They did nothing for us other than bring a fan. Miserable night sleep. If you don't book through them they treat you like garbage.
10,Dirty hotel ACs that don't work screws in the floor cutting feet etc. Front desk mamagement was rude when needing help. Housekeeping and mechanical staff were very kind but didn't seem to have the resources staff or time to appropriately complete tasks.
20,dusty room unpleasent staff overpriced and nothing is included. rooms are hot no matter what. no one makes the beds after requesting it fridges are warm. and housekeeping apparently is allowed to just walk in without knocking at 2 in the afternoon. the shower in tower room is nice i will say.
50,Always impressed with the uniqueness and fun at the Luxor. Plenty of things to do. Pool is excellent as always. Great atmosphere great food great staff all inside an amazing pyramid with views from every walkway......what's not to like! Definitely my favorite place to stay on the strip.
40,It was a fairly nice stay. Good view from the 13th floor. There is some wear and tear but nothing that would stop me from staying again. The app doesn’t work in the elevator so keep your key card handy.
20,No water no coffee machine no fridge long wait for service and I paid > $200 for a premium king tower room. Need I say more? Everyday we have to call several times to get room services. At the pool if you want any shade you have to pay > $100 for a chair with shade. What?
50,The 2 bedroom suite is like a condo---gorgeous spacious clean quiet comfortable. Worth the price. This is our favorite place to stay. It's at the far end of the strip but an Uber downtown is under $15. Plenty of slot machines. Table games are high but that's the norm on the strip. Go to the Downtown Grand if you want $5 tables. Not many food choices however. Have to walk to Mandalay Bay for more. Good for the summer in Vegas. 3 connected properties so you never need to walk out in the oppressive heat. Love this place.
50,I recently stayed at the Luxor during a work trip and after reading reviews I was a little concerned. However I am pleased to report I was pleasantly surprised. My experience was flawless and began with a complimentary upgrade to a pyramid premiere suite with a great view.    Upon entering the Luxor the lobby was large and clean. With the mobile checkin I was able to skip the check in line make a key and head straight to my room. My room was large clean and updated. The bed was comfortable and the AC had no problem racking the 110 degree heat. The room was the most soundproof hotel rooms I’ve ever stayed in. When I say I heard nothing once my door was closed I mean I literally heard nothing. No doors opening and closing in the hallway no voices in the hallway or in the rooms next door literally nothing which is impressive for any hotel but especially in a hotel with the age of the Luxor. The only flaw I saw with the room was that the shower had a stationary glass panel lacking the ability to fully enclose the shower this resulted in water splashing out and cool air coming in while showering. I realize this is a new trend but it’s one despise. Personal preference though.    Additionally every staff member I encountered was overly friendly and went out of their way to make me feel welcome. Finally I appreciated that the Luxor strictly limits the smoking to the casino unlike other hotels where it’s allowed fully in the lobby. It kept Amy smokiness to a minimum. They also had great ventilation making it barely noticeable compared to other properties.    Many of the large casinos on this end of the strip MGM NYNY etc are older and have really begun feeling dated I’d say when you take this into account the Luxor does a great job of feeling like it is on the more up to date end of the spectrum.    I would definitely stay again and recommend to friends.
50,It was a great stay. nice room easy to travel back and forth to South point for a bowling tournament. The buffet was excellent. Overall just a great experience. I had never stayed there. I was not disappointed.
30,Line at check in can take 2 hours at busy times. Crazy and unacceptable.  Buffet closes at 3 pm. Other restaurant closes at 1.45pm. Very busy but nowhere for dinner.  No coffee making facilities in room.  AirCon inefficient.  Pool music stupidly loud.  Smoking should NOT be allowed in public areas ( it it not in eating plaes thankfully)  And the saddest thing of all - no one cares. No one will take notice of this or any other review.
30,Food was sub par in the on-site restaurants. Room had layers of dust on return vent in bathroom. Las thing is I booked a month early yet I was placed on the west tower side. I was in town for Cisco live. The event was in Mandalay Bay conference center. It was a 2 mile walk each morning to the conference. There were other rooms available but I was unaware of the layout.
10,This was not at all what I expected from a casino with the MGM brand behind them.    1) Got a room in 3 hours after a coworker who had checked at the same time as me.    2) Coworker had to get his room switched too he had stains on his bathroom floor and dingy windows that were not cleaned ever.    3) When I did get a room after the first night the AC stopped working mind you it’s 110 degrees out so I’m miserable.    4) Got the run around with the front desk staff where I was told I could switch my room if I came back at a certain time I came back and they said no we can’t change you were overbooked.    I’ll never come back here even if it was free the Luxor is a terrible casino and I would recommend anyone go anywhere but there.
10,I booked into a room at 3pm. The room had not been cleaned from prior guest. It took standing in the long line several times and speaking with the front desk for them to finally clean it. It took the hotel 6 hours to clean it.
50,I came to the Luxor for CiscoLive. I really didn't have an opinion before I came since it is a known location on the lower side of the strip. The Luxor is almost forgotten but I loved it. The Uber app defaulted to the Excalibur pickup location every time I called an Uber though and that was a challenge at first. The tables had a couple $3 minimum bet games which was fun because you can play a little bit longer. My only complaint is the high pressure sales at the beauty stores within the hotel the sales people were relentless and annoying. If you find a good price book it I love this hotel!
40,- Great experience from customer service staff who were very helpful knowledgeable and friendly whenever a request for a customer need was asked.  - Exciting things to see and do while on this Luxor property that are in close proximity and indoors.
20,Air condition was not working properly and sink drainer was clocked. Need to make two calls for services. They came late in the night and room was very hot. Thermostat shows 60 but it was much warmer. Sink drainer water was running slowly after they opened it
40,Pros:  Checkin was super easy on the app and could easily make four keys  Pricepoint is great if you are in the rewards program  Easy access to MB and Excalibur love Hussongs and Slice of Vegas  Spa service was good  Pool was also decent (cabana was worth it for a group of five)    Cons:  Dated of course room is merely adequate.  So far south on strip.  Pay to park without pearl is ridiculous (mgm wide)  Won the smallest of handpays and guy is following me around begging for money  RIP Poker room
30,4th time staying here. Prices going up way more than other places on strip. Service gets worse every year. Rooms have less and less. (Hair dryer refrigerator etc.). Most of staff is relatively friendly.
40,I stayed here on a few occasion this was the first time I stayed at any hotel after COVID. Normally I would rent an Airbnb. but I decided to stay. The Luxor did not disappoint the room was clean and staff was friendly.
50,It was awesome we had a blast lots of things to do besides Gamble wasn't so impressed of the room but I'm sure you spend more you get more... Awesome experience you really don't even stay in the room that much anyways LOL
20,"AC was not working in the 1st room. We changed rooms and it was not working in the 2nd room either. Despite them coming to ""bled the lines"" the rooms never got below 77 degrees F. on days it was 110 outside"
30,You have to walk across the street for parking lot the app didn’t allow us to check in so we had to do the long wait they gave us our two rooms in two different towers one room in the west and the other in the east. Had to walk all the way back to the lobby to switch our rooms next door they charged me 300 dlls for “smoking fee” but no one smoked in the room.
40,I enjoyed my stay at Luxor in the Pyramid Premier Queen room. I found the room clean and nicely updated. The bed was comfortable. The walk to the room inside the pyramid was scenic. The price I paid by booking months in advance was of good value.  What is not of good value is the pool; shade will cost you more then your room. An umbrella with comfy lounge chairs cost over $100 a day. If you are lucky there is some free shady spots but most people burn in the sun whether in the pool or a free lounge chair.  What really impressed me is the staff and how they handled problems. They helped me with my missed inbound connector flight and lost luggage problem and a problem I had with MGM rewards. They did not quibble and say 'too bad' but rather sought a solution to my benefit.
30,While the hotel is great and has everything you need to enjoy vagas for a good value including entertainment. It’s service is good value compared to other hotels . You may want to go on higher floors and don’t do online check in as you want to pick your room  over all it’s got everything
10,Toilet exploded while we were out of the room while it was cleaned they should have moved us into another room. There was no wi-fi signal cellular signal weak due to interference no TV remote TV and A/C barely worked check-in took forever the walls are thin.
50,Our room in the tower was clean and comfortable… plus we love the variety in the casino and appreciate the cheaper tables. The pool is nice and we liked Baja Fresh at the food court for a quick meal. Also go to Blue Man group if you get the chance the kids and adults both liked the show.
10,Was given the wrong room even though we booked 4 months ago. We were supposed to have a king bed but got given a queen because they gave ours away. Filthy rooms with all 3 rooms we were moved to with broken air conditioners in every room. Apparently heating a pyramid is hard. Rooms do not come with clocks coffee makers or mini fridges! Was told by someone it was $25 to “rent” the mini fridge. Hotel is old and not comfortable. Will never stay there again.
50,As far as I am concerned this hotel is very good as a central location to all of the Casinos in Las Vegas Staff were friendly and helpful. the check in and out was perfect as well as the facilities. I usually stay at Luxor because it meets my requirements
10,Our flight was delayed out of our control. I called when we landed because the app wouldn’t let us check in and the lady told me that we were perfectly fine. We arrived an hour later and they told us since “we were a no show they gave our room away.” We rightfully were pretty upset and they came back and offered us a room without a working TV and the bathroom had red sticky stains all over it and mold in the bathroom. They told us they don’t care how far ahead we book(keep in mind we booked months ago and paid in FULL) and I will never be back and I will make sure everyone knows not to stay at the Luxor due to the quality of the resolution and service we received
10,See the explanation at beginning of survey. The hotel need a better cleaning crew Better management. The rooms are filthy. The carpet in the rooms looks a though it not been vacuum. They need to fire the entire cleaning crew and hire more reliable crew.
20,Just act cool and talk to everyone about your life. No one will believe you and every keeps to themselves anyway. Stay quite if you don’t want to get robbed stay low and follow laws and you will be good. Just don’t outward express you sadness here. There are cameras and microphones everywhere. Basically act like a robot and stay in the shade and you’ll be okay. This stay was fun I extended my stay…… and still got treated the way I’d did. Oh and my rental got stolen 1 day after I got out of desert springs….. by a tweaker. That’s a long story as well… everything here feels horrible. But I’m okay just don’t know what to do or how to go about a job or a way to get money out here now that I car is stolen…. The rental car……
50,Big suit on top of towerfor $200 😮😀 with amazing viewstaff was greatit had a pool table bar  jacuzziand two family room with surround sound and kitchenit was an amazing experience for all my family.
20,Upon arrival our room smelled the carpet was very damp in several spots the shower floor was not clean from p*b*c hair. We should have better checked amenities as we had to rent a mini fridge for $50. The 'No Smoking' rule did not seem to be enforced. On the plus side the staff was friendly enough. This was our first trip to Vegas and plan to go again but we probably won't be staying at the Luxor.
10,Unfortunately the Luxor representative booked the incorrect room the more expensive room. Upon checking in they said they would credit me $30 a day for the difference never happened. Then the Tower Room’s AC did not function properly set thermostat at 60 and never got below 75 degrees when the outside temp was 100
30,The hotel need a renovation. Stayed here years ago and it is now showing significant wear and tear. The majority of the restaurants were closed so we had to go to Mandalay Bay for dinner. The staff was nice but that's about it.
40,Luxor provides affordable rooms in an interesting building which is located at the south end of the strip. The overall room quality (esp. the beds) was nice although some amenities felt outdated or were missing (mini fridge). The price was lower than other hotels in a comparable location so this is still ok.
30,The AC did not work right and it made loud noise. It sounded like someone was outside my window doing construction work. The AC kept shutting off and the temperature was in the hundreds while I was there. With that being said when I would get out of the shower I immediately started sweating. My first 2 nights were terrible.
10,Stayed at this hotel cuz I missed flight and had a free room…but I only stayed one night because the room was too uncomfortable and couldn’t sleep. AC was trying but failed and the beds are not comfortable. But I do appreciate the last minute save. I wouldn’t intentionally choose to stay at this hotel. Staff at Check in were nice and helpful though.
40,Went on a vegas vacation for the first time and through reviews and price comparisons the luxor seemed to be a no Brainerd and was definitely a spectacular experience and visually stunning hotel did not leave disappointment
30,It would appear that they have so much business that they don't concern themselves with one guest's experience. I know the front desk and housekeeping get a lot of complaints but they don't have to be rude right out of the gate. I felt like they did not like their jobs or talking with guest's. I had an A/C issue in my room and the person at the front desk and the person in housekeeping tried to bounce me back and forth on the phone saying the other dept. needs to take care of it. I had to be the one to offer a solution and then they downplayed the problem.
10,First time staying here and most deffinetly will not stay again. Came for my birthday and got a room on second floor in a back corner looking at the hotels generators. Paid 120 for resort fee never once used the pool or gym and the one day i went to use the pool it was closed at 5pm. Serive from staff was non exsistant. Never once talked to anyone except for 1 person when we got there trying to sell me show tickets. What a joke this place is and would not recommend to anyone.
30,Shows were okay. Saw blue man group and body worlds. Buffet was super subpar. And we had multiple issues with our hotel room. Super bummed about staying here. We had saved up to do this and wish we would’ve spent our money elsewhere
50,It was nice and mellow for a Thursday. Would be nice to have new exhibits in there. Seems titanic and bodies have been in there for quite some time. Not very much to do inside the hotel during the day.
10,I cancelled my room with Luxor back in April. I have a cancellation email and everything but the customer service is claiming I never cancelled. They've charged my card four times now. I've called multiple times with no luck. I was finally able to get through yesterday and they said a manager would be calling me back but I haven't received a phone call yet.
20,One of our phones was stolen from us on the casino floor. When security was asked for assistance we were told..too bad it happens all the time. Then the same day the cleaning staff took all the change and all the poker chips in our room when they came thru with clean towels which we had not asked for and had hung up according to their rules in order to NOT get any clean towels. Again...oh they must have thought it was a tip!!....Really? In the middle of our stay? Who tips the housekeeping staff in the middle of a stay? The day we checked in the bed had been slept in and the pillow cases were all crumpled. The sheet was shoved down at the bottom of the bed. When we asked for both beds to be changed we were met with a lot of hostility from the housekeeping staff. The management came up and apologized gave us a certificate for half a dinner on them....half a dinner....ok. LEAVE NOTHING IN YOUR ROOM YOU DO NOT WANT STOLEN.
50,It’s a hotel room. It was clean sheets were clean towels were clean. Nothing special. It was cheap and had a high-end super 8 vibe. It’s at the end of the strip so plan to walk or taxi/Uber everywhere. No complaints.
40,Great trip never disappointed here at Luxor this would be my 3rd time at the hotel. Pool is open and lounge chairs are available. Staff is friendly and helpful during our stay. I will return again sometime
50,Beautiful Hotel Beautiful room amazing food guest service was awesome. My Family really enjoyed our stay and we recommend the Luxor to our Family and Friends. We plan togo back in October to celebrate family birthday so we will see the Luxor very soon.
40,Nice room view of the strip was Awesome but no refrigerator or microwave bus stop and tram right in front of the hotel. Unfortunately next to Mandalyn Bay where mass shooting took place awhile back. The tram does not go all the way down strip. Mr Josh was very helpful with show tickets and transportation around strip and the city.
10,the concierge service was bad and the check in experience was pathetic. I had to go back and forth thrice to fix my reservation issue and also incurred a los of $60.  House keeping doesn't replenish toiletries everyday I am never staying at Luxor again
40,Stayed in a Pyramid Premier King room for 4 nights in early June. Picked this property due to the location of where friends would be staying and the comps available to me.    I don't tend to stay this far south when in Las Vegas but I ended up really enjoying my stay. Likely in part becuase I didn't have many plans on the north end of the strip - so really didn't venture too far.    I am a MGM Rewards Gold member so check in at 1:00pm was fairly easy. I was not offered a Gold Member upgrade nor did I ask. I was happy to sleep in the pyramid. I had a room on the 18th floor which felt to be quite far from the elevator.    The room was clean newly renovated and quite large in size. The bed was quite comfortable and the water pressure in the shower was on point! I will say that the AC had a tough time likely due to the pyramid so it was quite warm in the day but cooled off while you slept. I had no noise issues but did have staff enter once shortly after I checked in. The day I requested housekeeping they did a good job!    The casino was a lot livelier than I expected. Saturday night the music was quite loud and was quite fun! Lots of places to eat in the Luxor or neighboring properties.    I did enjoy the Nuture Spa and found that to be quite relaxing. Was a really nice facility and prices being a bit more reasonable than MGM's higher end properties.    The pool was also a lot of fun. I would have to say though that they need to increase the level of the music to get just a bit more of a vibe going.    I did notice that my key card only worked in the elevator I was assigned and on the floor I was assigned. So if you are traveling with friends you will need to meet them downstairs to bring them up to your room or vice versa.    Overall I really have no complaints. The location isn't ideal but you do have a lot happening around you on the MGM Grand/NYNY/Excalibur corner. After having stayed I don't think I would let the location sway my decision to stay again unless I had a lot planned on the north end.
40,I know Luxor is one of the less expensive properties on the strip but I really enjoyed my stay there. My room was one of the recently refreshed Pyramid Premium rooms. It was very clean and comfortable and I had the novelty of staying in the pyramid. My only issue in the room was the battery in my room safe was dead but maintenance promptly attended the room and replaced it after I called. He also noticed a loose mechanism in the door and repaired that without even being asked. The maintenance was prompt and fully addressed this issue which was great.    There were also some good dining options on sight which were reasonably priced with the Backstage Deli Pyramid Cafe and Public house all offering good choices. Service at all of them was friendly and the food was great. I find the casino floor on Luxor is also a good time (I particularly enjoy center bar).    My only issue was with the pool which is a large open area with limited opportunity for shade by the pool area. I was there in late May 2022 but one of the pools was actually closed with a chain around it which was disappointing. I also used the gym facilities which while small were certainly clean and well maintained.    Overall I really enjoyed my stay at Luxor and was pleasantly surprised! I recommend it for anyone seeking a value oriented property on the strip.
10,Our room ac did not work and the front desk staff seemed offended that we bothered their busy day with this. We stayed for 4 nights and were miserable sleeping due to the heat. As a consolation they wouldn’t move us to a suite that had air conditioning working… they simply knocked a whole $80 off our resort fees (not even discounting the actual room)
10,Worse vegas experience ever! And we got food poisoning one year. The Luxor was such a let down. The decorations and theme are so cool but the room was awful. Air conditioner couldn’t keep up no towel holders a mini fridge on some weird aluminum stand build up of ice a  On the fridge. It was like a college dorm room. Very sad.
40,Pros. On the Las Vegas Strip there is a free Tram to the Mandalay Bay and Excalibur Hotels on each side helpful staff very comfortable beds quiet and night plenty of shops and restaurants.    Cons No Coffee Makers in the room. Felt a little “Nickel and Dimed” no fridge or microwave. We upgraded to a corner suite and then we got a small college fridge in our room
10,I'm paralyzed and I didn't get an accessible room like I asked it's so hard to roll on carpet and the elevator closest to my suite was out of service. The people here are just trash I won't recommend and defend. Won't ever come back
40,Super cool building. Thoroughly enjoyed the casino and casino layout. We Visited Bodies and titanic duo exhibits and were left impressed. The location was great to explore the south strip. Tram helped avoid the extreme heat. We’re only a little disappointed in the “grandeur” of a suite we booked just felt flat to us for a suite. Overall we had a great trip. One of our best! We’ll be back one day.
50,We enjoyed our stay. The view from our window was wonderful especially at night. The Blue Man Group was very entertaining and kept us watching carefully so we wouldn't miss anything. The beds were very comfortable and our room was very quiet. We would go back.
40,Uber from the Airport to the Hotel was $13 not including tip. Check in was simple after a short wait in line and our room was a premium Pyramid. The lobby area is one of with striking decor. The room was clean as was the bathroom. No coffee maker no refrigerator in room.  There is a tram between the Luxor Mandalay Bay and Excaliber. in addition there is a moving walkway to Excaliber.  We found the best way to get to the middle of the Strip was to use the LV Monorail which has a station at the MGM Grand.  The elevators were bumpy and there was often a wait.  Many of the escalators were out of service: not sure if there is an issue with parts or they were just shut off to save electricity.  We were there for 3 nights and found the gambling better at the Excaliber.  Also there is a lack of electrical outlets by the desk just one on the nightstand and below the television
50,We really enjoyed being able to see Great shows at our hotel without having to travel. They was plenty to also do at the 2 hotels connecting to the Luxor. AGT is a must see! We stayed 4 nights and had plenty of things to keep us entertained.
20,choose another hotel on the strip  prices advertised are not what you are charged  in comparison to other hotels like MGM.. it feels like a holiday inn  smoke permeated from the casino to the rooms. I will stay somewhere else if we ever go back to Vegas.
30,Issues with housekeeping and put boss. Housekeeping came in after knocking even when I yelled out we are sleeping not once but twice in the same morning. Issues at crap table due to deals not paying attention
10,We stayed at here for 4 nights. The A/C barely worked the sink drained super slow on the 3rd night I noticed a nasty stain on my blanket. Took it and showed the manager and all they did was give us $100 food credit and refund for resort fees for 1 night. And the bed was hard as the floor. The people that work there are not friendly they act like it’s a burden to help anyone
30,Good value for the money. Outdated rooms. Elevators are old smelly unclean and shaky. Elevators not close to some rooms a long walk. Moving Walk ways always broke between casinos. Electronic key/card does not work always.
20,Overall stay was mediocre check in experience wasn’t good getting an Uber was an inconvenience based on the pick spot. The rooms needed to be updated couldn’t get the blinds to open the rod broke off. This place just wasn’t worth the stay or the price paid.
50,My friends and I stayed at the Luxor because we had missed our flight back home and didn’t know of any place to stay. It was truly an amazing experience. It was actually a lot better than our original hotel. Definitely will be booking again in the near future.
40,Service was great. Rooms need a little upgrade. Carpets are worn out bathroom in my room would leak water everywhere when taking a shower because there was no shower door. Just needs an upgrade. Still love the hotel been multiple times since 1999.
50,First time in Vegas in while front desk agent Aziz :) greeted me with big and happy smile he was super friendly and helpful. I asked him if it was possible to get me closer to my other colleagues room he said “will do his best to find something close” and he successfully did!  10/10 ⭐️
20,Called and requested housekeeping each day. They came twice. Once was at 3am. One night a maintenance man barged into my room. Hallway was constantly dirty. The Luxor needs some minor tweaking and to make issues like these right immediately.
50,Very modern! The casino was nice the staff was very friendly. Overall it was a great time in Las Vegas!! Our room was so nice! Very clean very comfortable. I was impressed with the updates to the rooms. Always my go-to in Las Vegas.
30,It's a unique hotel in design and now history. A spectacle of engineering in its day now the Luxor sits as a shadow of its once glory an icon of the early days of the strip. Rooms are comfortable and large with unique 45° angled outside wall (keep those drapes closed during the day to keep your room cool). Inclinators are fun and not many people realize their engineering marvel these were. However the room key readers don't always work and you will learn which inclinator to use best for your floor. Food options in the hotel is really lacking but a short walk to Excalibur or MGM Grand will remedy that. Casino is small but clean and the open air to the point of the pyramid - which is a nice change from the typical 12' ceilings of every other casino in town. A real bargain for the money just don't expect much other than a comfortable sleep and a long walk to just about everything else in Vegas. (be wary of drunk fire alarms pulls throughout days and nights this is common)
50,Our room was so nice! Very clean very comfortable. I was impressed with the updates to the rooms. Very modern! The casino was nice the staff was very friendly. Overall it was a great time in Las Vegas!!
50,Nice getaway after undergoing many health issues. Really enjoyed the whole atmosphere the Hotel provided. The staff were very welcoming and made us feel right at home. Our room was more than enough what we expected. we enjoyed it. Thank you
50,Had 2 rooms for family for my bday. We had good times spending time in the room casino pool and surroundings. Quick service to fix a slow drain sink. Provided toiletries and towels as soon as we needed.
50,Our room was clean and comfortable the casino was fun there are lots of dining options and the bartenders were fantastic! The check-in process with the Mlife app was THE BEST. No waiting in line and you can use your phone to get into your room. If you want an actual key card you just go to a kiosk....so easy!
10,Don't waste your time or money. This hotel has gone down tremendously. They advertise renovated rooms. Not true. The hotel smells moldy and smokey. Long check in lines. Key cards don't work. Workers are not knowledgeable or rude. Pool area needs lots of attention old moldy lounge chairs. Life guard doesn't care or paying attention. Let dogs in pool water. This place is a hot mess.
50,Love how the property are connected. Hope to be back the next time . I was able to get my MGM reward card for military and upgrade to the 2nd teir. My free room from LAS Vegas slot app provides me a one night free room.
10,The hotel was overly Smokey and it drifted into the rooms. No coffee pot or microwave. The hotel was old and had water stains. People badgered you in the casino for time shares. Pool closed too early (6pm). Overall very poor for something owned by MGM.
50,What an awesome place to stay and gamble. A staple venue in the Las Vegas strip and part of the Las Vegas skyline. Next time I visit we are definitely staying again! The rooms and area were very clean. Using the MGM app to check in and digital key made skipping the line awesome!
50,No doubt I enjoy my stay. For being my first trip I really enjoy my trip. I love the idea to be able to use the tram to move around. I would totally stay there again. The staff as well were pretty nice and helpful.
50,We loved the hotel. It was in a good location had good food options and easy check in and check out process. Our room was very clean and everything looked up to date. We were in the west tower. The view from the room was very nice.
30,Negatives first the smell of cigarette throughout the casino and Marijuana was crazy at the Luxor and Excalibur. They need to upgrade the air filters and system. I made sure to gamble and took in shows outside in New York New York and MGM etc. My first room I was very disappointed in. The bathroom tub was flithy and the tub was clogged. The room itself next to the window smelled like cigarettes. Once we was upgraded and our experience was good. The room in the west tower smelled wonderful.
40,Good reasonably priced hotel that has close access to 3 others. Casino is ok mainly used the hotel as a cheaper place to stay while utilizing the other MGM hotels. I would stay again especially if going to a Raiders game or some event at the T Mobile arena
50,The Luxor is located perfect location to all MGM properties. They have many choices for restaurants the public house was very nice with many big screen to watch sporting events the food was exceptional and the service was top notch recommend this place for a nice evening.
20,Payed 250$ and was assigned a room on 5th floor with no nice view no fridge and not even a coffee machine or a bottle of water at least 2 tiny soaps that are good for maybe one shower for entire stay ? Forced resort fee for the stuff i didn't even use ? It was supposed to be a nice birthday stay but it wasn't I don't think I will stay there again. Very poor price/quality ratio.
20,This was a hot weekend and out of every casino we went to the Luxor was the warmest inside. The room we had was nice looking minus the horrible view of empty parking lots and abandoned old buildings. The problem with the room though was the AC seemed to be struggling to cool it down the bed was like sleeping on a board and the pillows they must get from the airline passengers when they come in.    The staff was very hit and miss there were some nice friendly staff members but there were about as many who did not want to be there this weekend and was letting it show. Be careful at the 24/7 convenient shop I was ripped off and over charged by the cashier who when called out looked more sorry she got caught than that she was ripping me off.    If you need a rewards card trust me when I say go to any of their other casinos and you will not have to wait an hour to get one. That seemed to be a big theme this weekend staff that didn't want to be there and long lines to try and do anything. It took me almost an hour to check in and I have priority level membership but the person checking priority in was not happy they were assigned that station alone and worked at a snails pace to punish the guests for showing up. Almost identical thing happened at the members reward cage 1 person unhappily helping while a manager plays on a computer behind looking up at the line grow.    If you have a free room I would say it would be worth it but unless this property does some major overhaul it's going to end up the next one on the strip to get ripped down.
50,fast easy early check in great staff. for the age of the casino. the upkeep is amazing. One question.Is carrot top ever going to move out?.. just kidding he always puts on a great show. Cant wait to get back to Luxor
20,Room not clean have to pay 15 dollars to walk a long way to room. Have to pay for internet. 30 dollars for valet parking. This property was not not great and they charge extra for every little thing. I will stay elsewhere.
50,Great stay and a wonderful staff. It was a last minute book and trip and they helped us out quickly and with little effort. The staff was very attentive and for our first trip definitely a reason to come back and stay here again.
30,Luxor isn’t the best hotel on the strip but it is a perfectly adequate stay for travelers on a budget. Great restaurants excellent staff service. Cons: the pool area is sub par and has barely any shade - there are no umbrellas to be found and they want you to pay over $100 for daybed rentals and $450 for a “cabana” that’s basically just a pop-up awning. The place reeks of cigarettes (a problem for any casino) and the location is at the far end of the strip so you’ll be Ubering or walking to most places.
30,Room wasn’t available when I arrived so they offered me another room but I had to pay 15$ per each night. From desk lady wasn’t professional at all. When I got to new the room it wasn’t ready either. Prices are so high for what they actually offer.
50,Had a great stay corner suite was large and clean beds were comfortable Blue Man show was awesome. Lots of gaming options and food options. Large variety of new and nostalgic slots that seem to have a pretty good payout…can’t wait for our next trip.
30,TLDR: Resort fees will be costly. Elevators that seem to exist to torture the peasants that stay there. They take the ancient Egypt theme too seriously as they don’t include modern technology such as mini-fridges.    I got a room with a king sized bed. They did not have a mini fridge and a mediocre view.    Also their elevator system is beyond ridiculous. They require either a key card or the app on your phone. The scanner worked half the time. My friends stayed at the Flamingo and they didn’t have to deal with that kinda lunacy.    The vending machine on my floor (near my room) was not working during my entire visit. 4+days. room service food was good and the staff was professional and proficient. I think the problem lies with the owners the obviously don’t care too much about the customer experience.
10,They lock out the ac units so you can’t have a cool room. Can’t sleep at night it’s too warm. Also be prepared to spend crazy amounts of money on food and drinks… water included. Also everyone has their hand out and wants a tip even though they already include gratuity in most things.
30,We enjoyed our stay but our room was outdated. The lighting was very dim throughout the room and some bulbs were out in the restroom. The elevators made me dizzy every time I was on them because of the inclination.
50,Did my research and knew what to expect. Pyramid corner king suite was fantastic. Soaking tub mini fridge lots of room. It was clean and in very good shape. Staff friendly. Mobile check in easy - wasn't looking for upgrade or concerned about view. HINT if you're want the best view go to Sky Fall at the Delano next door for a drink!
20,The staff at bell check seemed uninformed or unsure of how to answer my questions about check in. The person who ended up helping me after over 45 minutes of standing around due to the inconvenience caused by the mobile app/mobile check in seemed very straight forward in getting things done. I appreciated the help of said person and they also offered me a self-parking enhancement which was convenient. I asked a question about the security deposit and how the additional charges would be applied to my credit card. The question was will the enhancement charge be taken out of the security deposit and the person helping me said that it would yet I still experienced a net positive charge as part of my balance. This upset me because I was unable to budget for that charge had the information been correct I would have spent less time trying to resolve yet another issue. As far as the guest room goes I was bothered by the lack of available refreshments and did not want to use the cups in there to drink out of the bathroom sink. There was no refrigerator and no accessible quality drinking water. I traveled to the vending machine on the same level and the vending machine was broken. There was no in-room safe which was listed as an amenity. The shower door was broken upon arrival and was difficult to close. This also concerned me as I didn’t want to be blamed for previous issues. There were some alcohol stains on the tile as well which was just more of an eye sore rather than a nuisance. The 1-800 number was unavailable during my trip so I could not find customer service help during the time I was either. Not an aesthetic view outside the room window and the sound insulation seemed low. Check-Out was an absolutely a confusing mess and the mobile app has some serious work that needs to be done in order to provide a better guest experience at MGM Resorts. Likely will not be staying in the Luxor Tower during future visits.
50,I love the Luxor. Relaxed vibe staff is excellent. Stayed there multiple times and haven't had a bad experience yet. Last trip has 3 rooms a corner suite for my wife and I a double queen for daughter and friends and a pyramid king for daughter and son-in-law. No problems no issues just excellent service and stay.
30,Stayed here for just a couple of hours to rest our heads before boarding our delayed international flight. Room was quite dark clean though. No tub only a shower. Beds were comfortable.    Check-in took ages (45 minutes) and after returning home I realised my credit card was wrongly charged. MGM quickly refunded me without any issues so good customer service.    I wouldn't book this hotel for a longer stay however too basic and general vibe wasn't really appealing (read: cheap prices attract a certain kind of 'louder' crowd).
50,Was given an upgraded room due to being here for honeymoon. Room was clean quiet and beds were comfortable. Check in and check out were a breeze. The slushy drinks are the best by the pool. Loved the pool.
30,carpet was stained and dirty (can't see dirt but as soon as you step out of shower you see on shower floor what the bottom of you feet left). Also the elevator my room was next to went out of service which meant a long trek around to next elevator which in itself not too bad but my rm key stopped working just before checking out and I had to stand in line to get reactivated and only made flight by 10 minutes.
40,I booked the hotel as a birthday and Father’s Day surprise for my husband. We loved it. My only issue is no microwave. The food is too expensive to have access to reheat after coming back from the Vegas strip.
10,"This used to be a nice hotel that was cheap. Now it's a cheap hotel that is cheap. We have stayed several times and this was by far the worst. The room was never cool we had to call every day to get room service. And when room service does arrive they do not knock. If you call the front desk someone ""might"" answer after about an hour of being on hold. The water just didn't come one morning. Awful."
50,Great Week visiting family. Room was clean got upgraded to a tower suite. Hotel staff was friendly and informative. Great My Vegas app deals. Would definitely come back again pool was clean and had plenty of chairs to lounge on.
10,There were no mobility scooters available for my handicap mother. Pool closed too early. Air conditioning didn't work. The room was dirty. We had to wait a day to switch rooms. The ice machines on the floor didn't work and they refused to bring ice. It was a horrible experience. I will never book her again!!
10,Check in service was unattended and unfriendly. Bar and drink service were not friendly and charged for accommodations like extra ice drinking while gambling was discouraged as they charged for drinks that are usually complimentary. Vegas has definitely taken a downturn if this is the representation of it.
30,Pretty general stay. Slightly overpriced for the room. The room had a heavy cleaner smell that straddled the tolerable/not tolerable fence. The buffet was by far the worst part of this hotel. Save your money on this for sure.
50,Had a great stay and time everyone at the hotel was pleasant and helpful and even had a skin consultant help me out with my skin needs. Thx Niki for ur help! Over all it was fun and exciting luv the dining experiences there too. Had great drinks and the atmosphere was fun. Thk u Luxor
50,It was a very nice and rooms were nice and the pool was great my grandkids and kids loved the pool the most didn't do any shows we have not been to Las Vegas in 12 years so it was a good get away hope to go back soon
50,This is an under rated property on the Strip. The place is kept clean and the staff working here are very nice. Being at the south end of the strip it is not as congested while still close to the strip.
20,Room was not really clean finding a parking spot was really hard. The online checked in was very convenient except that I ended up going to the front desk to change the room. The buffet was closed on Wednesday and It should be opened. Not a big deal but still I was looking forward to go there.
50,We visit about four times a year and when we arrive it’s like a second home. Everyone is so nice from check in to Housekeeping and floor attendants. My VIP host Sally makes sure we have what we need to enjoy our stay. The location is perfect walking distance to other venues but we never leave.
50,GREAT!!!!!!!! Our host Sue makes every visit an experience to remember. Always making sure that all needs are met. It would be great to hit a big jackpot but hopefully this will happen on one of my visits.
50,You get a five star quality at budget value. Can’t go wrong with the Luxor pool casino rooms or dining options. The public house is a great spot to watch any sports game. Easy to get to the the strip and take in all the sights. Will stay here again for sure!
30,Book this hotel as a good buy thru expedia. Learned that resort cost is 50% more than basic cost. Checking in was good as many skip the line thru Mgm rewards apps its owner. Requested for a newer room as learned from reviews. Had to pay $10 more per day still pyramid side but premium. Room had no refrigerator for my medication learn to use housekeeping to get a fridge which again will cost $25 but waived due my medical condition for an almost broken down fridge. Room service takes ages. Stay was ok comfortable. Be careful to use lobby internet as it will cost you by the minutes. Luckily brought my ipad. Will I come back here there are better places.
20,I don't get to come to Vegas as much as I used to but I always stay at the luxor. This time I was a little disappointed n o fridge in the room the shower would not drain properly.other than that it wasn't a bad stay
40,We had a room with an ajoining room. Very loud needs more insalation. The elevator takes some getting use to!. i have stayed here quite a few times. It is one of my favorites! The room was very clean.!
50,Clean room great shower. Close to everything I needed. Easy parking for over sized vehichels. I wasn't charged for parking either. Friendly staff and great air conditioning. Small shops had all the snacks.
50,Great room great price! Staff is helpful mgm resorts is the way to go when you come to Vegas! I would always suggest the luxor. Great dining shows and entertainment. I will definitely be staying again
40,Great hotel for the price very convenient to other places clean room AC needs could be a little cooler but overall good experience. Easy to walk to Mandalay Bay or Excalibur Hotels. Used to have 24 hour restaurant but staffing issues understand that the closing early
10,Either needs a major update and a cleaning or time to replace. Ac doesn’t work well change your room at last second and try to charge you the same rate for a lower class room. Dirty shabby and well worn.
30,The hotel was clean and unique in design. The pool area was clean and relaxing for the most part. The downside is it seemed impossible to win at the slots or tables. I talked to several other guests that felt the same way. I felt like we were getting priced gouged on food and drinks at the hotel. Most of the staff was friendly except I encountered a rude housekeeper.
40,Value is good. Rooms are good if you are not looking for luxury. I consider it a value hotel. The staff was great whenever we encountered them. Casino floor was large and had a good variety of games for every one
50,We had a great stay. Room was a great size for the 3 of us. Great location. Easy to walk between hotels. Ate at Johnny rockets. Was nice for Late night dinner. We had a great time visiting and enjoyed the stay
50,Luxor is the most underrated MGM property on the strip. The rooms are inexpensive especially their suites and they are clean and comfortable. The staff and service is always outstanding. Parking is a breeze to get in and out of. The location is excellent. It's still my favorite sportsbook in Vegas and it's non smoking. A great selection of slots and I win there quite often. Tender the steak house at Luxor never disappoints. Ask for Dewey if you go.
40,Like the location employees: helpful and courteous I find the Luxor does keep the property very clean.    I do enjoy spending time at the pool. I go to the pool every day for at least 2-3 hours.    Also like the breakfast buffet. Hope the dinner buffet returns soon.
50,It was perfect. House cleaning came every morning and the pool was cool. Room service for breakfast was on point. All the host on the floor were pleasant to deal with. I loved the view from my room on the eighth floor
30,Another expensive place!! Room was very nice but a big problem getting out of the parking garage. Ticket didn't work and had to back up with a car behind me then go find someone to help me get out. What a pain!! And $15.00 to park for 24 hrs??!! Sheer greed!! As if this place doesn't make enough money off the gamblers!! I will not be back!!
10,Terrible experience. Front desk was terrible . Hidden back end fees you’re unaware about. Will not be going back. I tried to come here and have an enjoyable time but they clearly don’t know how to treat their guests
10,Room was very hot and when trying to ask for help nobody answered . The shower was also clogged and so was the sink. Tried calling service desk multiple times each day and never got an answer. I won’t stay at Luxor agai.
50,Good price and clean room all the staff members are very friendly parking is also very nice but slot machines are very hard to win. Everything was good but slots are very disappointed I will visit again
40,My only problem was in my room (9091). The thermostat kept on going back to 60 after I set it for 72 or even turned it off. I didn't have time to call maintenance but I wish I could have. My friend's room (9094) seemed to have the opposite problem. I froze he melted. But I'd rather freeze than melt...
30,The price was good and the hotel has everything to keep you busy. The room definitely needs some attention as it is showing its age. When we plugged in the outlets the plug would fall right out. Overall for the value it wasn’t bad. Now the elevator was not my favorite as it is an incline elevator and shakes pretty hard going up at the angle. I already have a slight fear of elevators and this did not help.
30,Elevator was not working for entire 3 days I was there forcing me to take a different elevator on the other side of my room. Room did not get clean on second days. Buffet restaurant was not open for dinner. Some staff members were very nice while some others were not very friendly.
40,Parking was packed and a bit far from hotel. Check in was smooth. West tower king bed room was roomy super clean and the shower water pressure and head was the best I’ve ever experienced not to mention the deep bathing tub. Two negatives… the live lobby music was absolutely horrible and deafeningly loud and the checkout phone app did not work despite repeated attempts.
30,Once Uber dropped  Me  Off  I was shocked by the filthy carpet  At the entrance.I was totally confused while trying to find the front desk.Cjeck I’m was ok Although there was a very long line.The hotel has very poor lighting and looks like something out of the 70’s.The rooms were just ok…nothing special.
30,Be aware of the elevators when staying! Was stuck in one for over 45mins. Staff act if I didn’t know how to use my room key! When calling for help was hung up on twice because they couldn’t hear me. Just ridiculous!
20,The hotel is really showing its age. Decor is dated room was dirty bathroom fan was broken toiletries were not great room felt damp. I did the online check In and the room was ready 5 hours after the expected time.
20,My wife and I stayed at Luxor 6 years ago and had a great experience. This time not so much.    First we were booked in a room on the 17th floor that had a distinct metallic odor. The window drapes did not properly close so the 105 degree heat baked the room. Recipe for a miserable 3 night stay.    I called the front desk and after several minutes of waiting for a clerk the gentleman offered us a room on the 21st floor.    Now how to get there... the elevators at the luxor suck. No other way about it. They're rickety and loud. And require a key card to get to your floor. In order to check in quickly I opted for the digital key. Bad decision! Once our room changed the MGM app showed the new room but I could never get the key to work in the elevator.    So we couldn't get to the 21st floor from the 17th. Called the desk again. Another wait to answer. We'll send someone up to help. 10 min later no help. Call again. Wait again. Got the same clerk that moved us. He was great said one of the bellmen was on his way and offered a $50 comp. Finally help arrives and we get to our room. A nice room. Cool with no odor. Only took an hour to get there.    The rest of our stay was relatively uneventful though the elevators really suck and I can't confirm my bill and wasn't about to wait in line for 30 min to talk to someone. I'll call this week... and wait!    Next time regardless of the price we'll find another property.
30,Some of the poker machines are the bars were dirty /sticky. Some of them not working. The center bar was closed until evening time. Problems with the digital keys. Not all restaurants were open. Bar staff lacks personality
10,The first room we were given did not have working air conditioning second room had water leaks in the restroom. Elevators were broken had to walk to further one. Will not be returning to Luxor hotel.
50,What an amazing stay for our first ever trip to Vegas…    Did the $20 trick when we checked in and got upgraded to a tower elite room in the east tower couldn’t have asked for more! Had a clean room daily a fridge and a coffee machine even though the supplied coffee was pretty terrible it was still a nice touch.    Only thing I didn’t like was that if you want shade at the pool you have to pay for it and in 41-42C weather that’s not great. Also why aren’t the edges of the pool cleaned properly?    Other than the above what a great stay and would definitely stay again next time.    Thanks!
50,Best hotel I’ve ever been to!!! I loved ever second of it. The service from the employees was so kind and helpful. My view was wonderful a sweet girl offered to move my room to the 18th floor free of charge without me having to ask. The room and the view was stunning. Most comfortable sleep I’ve had in so long. Will be staying here again some time soon.
50,Loved the accommodations. We stayed in the pyramid. The elevator was cool! Also we loved eating at the Pyramid Cafe & Public House. Food was excellent. Blue Man Group was great! We were on our honeymoon & had never been to Vegas. This hotel is in a perfect location. You can walk to a lot.
30,As someone who previously stayed at the Luxor multiple times a year usually in a tower suite and usually very happy with my stay I can honestly say do not stay in a Pyramid room if you have another option. The newer bathroom design is horrible with a walk in shower with a only half shower door so that when you take a shower it makes a mess and the bathroom floor is so wet you are lucky if you do not slip and fall. There were no towel racks or shelves in the bathroom so the towels are just folded and stacked up and taking up the limited space you have on the bathroom counters. The air conditioner unit in the room was noisy which would not bother me if it was actually putting out cold air. But it was putting out cool air at best and the thermostat was so finicky it was hard to get the unit fan to stay on the high setting.  And last but not least if you are a gambler the new MGM Rewards program that replaced the Mlife Rewards program is a complete mess. If you like to keep a higher member status for the perks then look elsewhere because MGM Rewards just made it 3-4 times harder to keep your status but they continue to take away more and more of the perks associated with your status.
30,Overall the stay was good wouldn't say it was the best. Haven’t stayed here since 1999. I don’t really know what has changed or what. But it needs to be renovated again. But it’s it’s been good for the stay
40,As long as you don’t get stay well rooms it’s an awesome hotel. I stay here every visit to Vegas which is often. Especially glad I signed up for the rewards it’s pay off with discounts on rooms and dinning so I’m able to go more then I normally would.
30,Clean couldn’t as for better but like all American right Know not much service on floor drinks when came so over load that made sad stop go Bar buy drinks come back too table but hard making find more help maybe as we open up more come back thx
50,Enjoyed our stay! Suite was spacious clean and comfy. Kids loved the in room soaking tub. The casino was a good size lots of games won a few good times. Comped by host in full at the end of the stay.
30,Staff was great more choices of food would have been better. The rooms need to be updated. No door on the shower so bathroom floor was wet and slippery after every shower. A/C did not work well in the room. Room wasn't hot or unbearable but wasn't as cool as I like it. I hear the rooms in the tower are much better. Maybe next time I will stay in the tower.
30,The stay wasn’t bad. It was okay. Pool service took forever to bring out our food that we ordered. No shaded areas unless you get a cabana. Rooms need to be updated and add a refrigerator and or microwave.
10,“New” a/c units in pyramid rooms switched off constantly. Sometimes after just 10-12 minutes. Sometimes the a/c switched off and the heat came in by itself! In June! In Vegas. I could take the dated rooms that clearly hadn’t had a thorough cleaning in a while (two of the three rooms had hair all over the bathroom floor upon entry) but no a/c? Three sleepless nights. When I called maintenance they someone who changed the batteries in the thermostat. Needless to say that didn’t change anything. Awful stay. You don’t need much on the strip in Las Vegas but you do need a functioning air conditioning.
10,Outdated rooms. Poor quality beds. Nasty unclean rooms and bathrooms. Unfriendly staff. Will never stay here again. Worst experience I’ve had in Vegas in my life. I go to Vegas 4-5 times a year and had some bad trips but never this bad.
50,We always have a good time staying at the Luxor. The staff is friendly and the rooms are nice. The buffet is good and not insanely expensive. I will probably be staying there again inmy next Las Vegas trip.
20,The wallpaper in the hallway was falling down bathroom fixtures were old and dingy and rusty hallways were also unclean. There are so many other better options on the Vegas strip besides this place! You have to pay for a refrigerator which is brought up on a cart and looks like it’s falling apart… Bed was so uncomfortable…
10,Wouldn't recommend to anyone ever first room air conditioner was not working good  very hot & uncomfortable maintenance man couldn't fix the problem so we had to move to another room & they charged us extra $20 each night after that  why did we get charged for the broken down hotel  we ran into another couple on elevator the next day they did the exact same thing to  they put you in a bad room then move you & charge you an upgrade fee lol  even after the second room we moved to was OK with a good air conditioner someone next door was fighting all night out in the hallway & no security ever came up to even investigate  I will never stay at Luxor again.
30,I generally stay at another Hotel but wanted to stay at the Luxor thinking it would be alot better. I was very disappointed. Was not able to eat at the Pyramid because you had to scan a QR code for reservation and take out food. Not enough restaurant choices for food at the food court.
50,Cheap prices during Memorial Day week. Pizza $40 up slice $8.50 food high shows pricey but hotel nice and cheap with good quality food. Train goes to Excalibur and mandarin bay from Luxor. Close to MGM
30,I stg this hotel is haunted. Seen things in the mirror heard noises n random people wandering around my floor. The room was okay. You just get what you pay for. When people weren’t trying to open my door I could finally sleep.
30,We came and wanted to be wowed but unfortunately we were not. When we arrived in the room it had a bad odor I tried to reach out to the front desk and had no luck tried calling from the phones in the room and none of them worked. I finally reached someone and was advised possible tomorrow someone would be able to fix the issue. We tried to turn on the televisions and only one worked. This was not the wow factor for our first time to Vegas while also having the kids. They were not able to move us to another room  so we just had to deal with it . Upon leaving I called the front desk to get bell service and waited quite sometime when I finally got through and requested bell service I was transferred and then disconnected on 3 times. Finally I just said forget it I will try to have me and my kids haul our luggage ( mind you the struggle when they are small) mainly myself. I really was looking forward to a great experience but can’t say I had one .
10,Room is very out dated there was no soap -- no shampoo-- no toilet paper holder on the wall no drinking glasses in the room .very thin walls slaming doors all night long.wpyld never stay here again or recommend to friends or family.
40,Pavilion double queen west tower. Good location. Use mobile checkin/phone for room key. In person like looked an hour long. Worth it if you can get it cheap/40 resort fee. I save by switching properties/reward cards.
50,All of the staff was very friendly and helpful. The bartenders at flight were absolutely amazing.. This was my husband's first time experiencing Las Vegas and will be one he never forgets. The only trouble we had was our digital keys not working sometimes
20,Elevators are terrible and do not work spent more time and them then and join our trip. I do not recommend this hotel for anybody I will never go back even if it’s free not much to do there other hotels same price way nicer
10,Nothing for kids to do. Did not accommodate handicapped clients. Too far to get to rooms in the tower. Self parking extremely long. Not a good experience. Definitely not returning. Pool hours ridiculous
40,Paid the extra upgrade to the renovated rooms. Beautiful furniture. Loved the super soft pillows on the bed. The rainfall shower while beautiful and great water pressure has no door and got water everywhere in the bathrooms. Thought everything was pretty easy to find in the casino. I’ve visited the casino in the past and I don’t remember the casino floor being as smokey as it was this time around. I loved the food and drinks I got at Public House in particular. I would definitely consider staying here again and recommend it to others especially if you are planning on spending time at the MGM casinos or the south part of the strip in general.
40,Used my 3 free night offer to play event 13 of your he wsop.  Some issues at check in very nderstaffed.  Great room quiet and dark for sleeping.  Got my exercise in the daily walks to/ from Paris/ Ballys and they have a very nice fitness center.  Food court closes early but Excalibur and New York casino ar open for food past 10 pm.
20,On our 8 year anniversary they put me and my wife in a room where the other rooms around us were under construction and would wake us up with loud construction noises around 7am. It was our first non kids trip since we have been married due to me being in the military and being deployed. I finally got out of the military and got to have a little get away and the room wasn’t as great as we had hoped.
50,Service is always exceptional  always clean and neat . AC was working well.always really good prices . Kind personal .good location  Azziz who help us on the front desk was kind and really helpful .
50,My friend and I decided to go on a last minute mothers day/ birthday adventure. We had two days to confirm all travel arrangements and reservations. Luxor was able to assist with getting us the corner room suite we requested. Loved the early check in and late check out and was even granted an extended late check out time at no additional charge. Had an awesome getaway. Luxor staff provided friendly and accomodating services. Highly recommended.
10,The staff was rude and the room was in poor condition. There was very little bedding on the bed and the bathroom was dirty. Asked an employee for directions and was told she wasn’t clocked in and walked away.
10,What can I say it is a horrible hotel with the stinky smell of marijuana that to me smelled like rotten bologna.On too of that a hair in the salsa at Diablos and came home from a relaxing day at the spa only to find a live bed bug on my pillow GROSS!!!!
40,High ceilings were great. Didn’t smell like stale cigarette smoke. Lots of signs with arrows so easy to find things. The only thing it was missing was some take out options other than Starbucks. Overall it was great. Will stay there again.
10,I booked another hotel and checked out early that’s how much I loved the cleanliness noise level and service at this hotel.    I original booked this hotel for the great deal but it’s not worth the trade off for all the issues. I’d rather pay a bit more for sleep quality clean room and better service. Which was what I ended up doing.
40,My 4th time staying there each time they have improved the room quality and upkeep. Except for missing refrigerator. Which might be normal post covid? Plenty of towels. Short staff ('thanks Joe Biden' and Nancy Pelosi) no one needs to work these days.
40,We had a wonderful time and the room was very clean and comfortable. The bed was perfect. I only wish we would not have been next to the elevators. The buffet was excellent. We would definitely stay at Luxor again.
40,I have always wanted to stay at the Luxor and finally had my chance. The staff was nice and always helpful but the room was straight out of the 70s. No modern amenities like plugs or usb for phones and programming was archaic. We paid extra for an upgraded room and found a vent hanging and all of the AC manual knobs broken off for adjustments.
20,Was hoping to have a better experience at the Luxor. But I was wrong. The shower wouldn’t drain. The sink didn’t have a stopper. Sheets were dirty. Elevators were dirty. Sales people were pushy and rude.
40,I had such a great time in Vegas and I made the best choice by staying in Luxor Hotel… met a great guy called Gil Guintes/Guintus who was very helpful; every company should have thousands of Gil Guintes 😸 very friendly and helpful. I loved the hotel nothing too crazy very clean and made me feel like I was in Egypt 😸 i’ll be back soon.
50,Very nice property. Easy to access from Las Vegas Boulevard. Rooms are nice and very quiet. Staff is very friendly and helpful. There is a tram out front making it easy to go to other properties. Well maintained.
40,Overall great time and location to celebrate my 21st Birthday just was overcharged and waiting for my payment to return. Other than that great time overall pool was great casino was fun food court was good and my room was amazing
30,We had some complications with air conditioning in our room causing discomfort in our room. The gambling and dining experiences were good. We loved the ease of check in and check out! The tram also made it easy to get from hotel to hotel. I would encourage you to do some research before booking.
50,Great friendly service by front desk and housekeeping. Clean and spacious rooms especially restrooms. Casino attendants were also very friendly and helpful. Atmosphere was very welcoming. Will definitely stay again
30,Nice thematic stay lives up to its hype should have maybe a few more food court options. Pool cleanliness was pretty bad though at closing lots of garbage being overlooked by staff. Rooms were mid AC filters needs to be changed out more often the dust levels on some of the furnishings were not tolerable.  Appreciated the concierge and front desk staff they were very kind.  Overall decent experience but small things like dust shouldn't be an issue lol.. thanks!
50,Tower 1 bedroom suite was beautiful. Never been in a suite before. It felt like home lots of room quite very well kept. Just a beautiful room very satisfied with the comfort of the bed. But it could have used a microwave.
50,The people communication friend ships relax time and forget everything about job and enjoy the view a round of the place the private and all alternative for shows fooddrinks and game machines. Thanks
30,Resort fees are high and you don’t receive much for this. Pool is only open from 9am-6pm and drinks round the pool are very pricey! There is a lack of food choice - if you like fast friend food then there is a few choices for that.  The new rooms in the tower are a decent size and the beds are comfy there is no mini fridge.  We requested a late check out and for 4 hrs they were going to charge $200! So we opted for paying for an extra night which cost $150 ( we left the room at 6.30pm) I thought this was extortionate!
10,Not happy with the service I received. Rooms was not clean internet didn't work Phone-no reception Not enough parking space Mobile app was nice but didn't always work specially for going in/out of the parking.
10,The hotel is old and way too overpriced for what you get. The resort fees parking and food are all insanely overpriced for what you get. $12 for a drink at the pool? $30 for breakfast buffet? Will never pick this place again.
30,This was my second stay at the Luxor we were there with a large group in 2019 and had an overall good experience but after my most recent trip last week I will not be returning. We returned with the same group of people and more to celebrate a birthday as we had a good experience previously. We paid a little extra for an upgrade to the Tower Room when checking in the same type of room we stayed in the previous trip. The rooms have become really rundown a lot of limescale and grime build up over the bathrooms other peoples hairs in the bathroom and a sink that drained poorly. The hotel had quite a bad sewage smell throughout corridors and in the rooms and when that went away it just smelled of weed very strongly.    The servers in the casino were terrible I have managed a centre bar in a casino and wouldn’t dream of having anyone with that attitude on my team. We were at a blackjack table for about twenty minutes when the server came to drop a drink off at the table for another player she did not attempt to make eye contact with anyone at the table and did not ask if anyone needed a drink while she was there. Another thirty minutes went by and she was nowhere to be seen quite a few more players had joined the table at this stage. I saw her on the floor and asked very politely if she could pay a visit to our table and pointed out where it was she then said she had been just there recently even though everyone was sitting at the table without a drink at this stage. I explained we saw her dropping off a drink but she didn’t make eye contact or do a quick check to see if anyone needed a drink and that’s why we would like her to call by our table. After that I didn’t see her for quite a while and when she eventually came back to the table she was saying to us all very aggressively I was just here even though she could clearly see not one of us had a drink at this point. That was the last time I saw her that night we ended up moving on and gambling in other hotels. The second time we tried to gamble in the Luxor on this trip it was a similar situation servers avoiding taking drinks orders nowhere to be seen after that we gave up on gambling at the Luxor.
20,Very little value for your money here. The “resort fee” doesn’t get you very much here. If you want something as simple as a mini fridge it’ll cost you $25 a night. The room seemed not completely put together very sloppy. Sink was loose and the sealant around the shower was sloppy. The only real resort benefit was access to the pool but even at that you have to reserve a chair ahead of time. It was almost $30 for just 2 small drinks at the bar. Everything was a rip off. The only thing that saves this hotel is the fact that it’s a pyramid which is pretty cool. Oh and the A/C units suck it took the weekend to cool down.
30,All I can say I had a bad experience at the hotel and I wouldn’t recommend unless it’s the last option. The place was dirty and had a lot of homeless roaming around I would write a novel on how bad the place was but rather have you experience it yourself.
10,Casino was terrible can not Evan get playback. Machines are rigged. I heard nothing but bad about this casino from everyone. I spent over 5000 and did not hit anything should of went somewhere else and so many extra charges when you check in. Absolutely not happy with vegas at all
20,Staff was excellent… the rooms were not. Shower leaked water outside of the shower door was dirty (door handle) couldn’t clean it. Curtains couldn’t close all the way. They were missing some hardware so they couldn’t block all the light out. We were on the 28th floor and had issues with the elevators not scanning our room keys because the scanners were not working.
20,Dirty and smelly room. Stunk like cigarettes and they didn't have another room for us. The safe was locked and it took them 4.5 hours and me calling 5 times to fix it. Neither 5v worked only one got fixed. Hair on bathroom floor (partial fake eyelash) and pubic hair stuck to bathroom ceiling. We found blood on the mattress cover after the first night. Just a gross room over all. I won't stay here again.
30,Not as I envisioned my family vacation going. Hotel is nice but it’s not family friendly. Food was expensive and had limited options. Pool has absolutely no shade unless you pay an arm and a leg for a cabana. Kids did not have fun at all at the pool. Best part for them was the tub in our suite and our trip walking downtown.
40,The Luxor was a great hotel on the strip for a good price and exceptional amenities and service! My wife and I would absolutely stay again in the future. I give it four stars because our room was missing a fridge.
20,AC not working Elevators creepy TV very old not clear. When we asked to check out at 12 instead of 11 they declined our request. I used to always stay here but after this time I don’t think i’ll ever go back.
10,The quality and cleanliness of the room were not of resort quality more that of a motel 8 to be ho eat. Staff not nice when it comes to handling guest complaints. Housekeeping was amazing but everything else just made my trip more exhausting and not so enjoyable
10,Dark hallways you have to use the stairway to find a floor with an ice machine and you will encounter strange individuals lurking by the elevators trying to gain access to floors they do not belong on.
30,"Nice Rooms at a great price but I would rate the overall stay as a 3 out of 5 because of the pervasive cigarette smoke smell everywhere in the hotel. Other hotels have a separation between the Casino floors and the hotel rooms but the Luxor has one open vaulted space and is one of the older hotels on the strip so the smoke smell is stronger everywhere. Otherwise the rooms were very nicely updated and the staff excellent. It is a very unique ""Las Vegas"" themed hotel they just need to update their air purification and elevators."
20,Luxor has become a rundown and dirty hotel. Walking thru the parking lot is disgusting. A good pressure washing just might do the job people. The room was clean and did showed a lot of wear but acceptable. I'm a person that requires a decent room just to sleep but the noise level was horrible on the 4th floor. Just to be fair I didn't complain or ask to switch rooms which would require me to stand in a long very long line at check-in. I'll miss Luxor but it's time to relocate somewhere else.
50,We had a great experience at the Luxor during our 4 night stay. Been to Las Vegas many times and this was our first time at this hotel. Will book here for sure next visit. Service at check-in was amazing.
20,Horrible stay. We had a renovated pyramid premier queen- no clock mattresses old and uncomfortable no front to the shower shoddy outlets no front to showers every channel on TV was messed up etc. The kicker was being on the 14th floor but awakening at 9 am due to the pool music. Also those inclinators are rickety the controls don't work half the time and are dingy dirty messes. Location is good that's about it.
10,The hotel and facilities are really nice and although at the shabbier end of the hotels in vegas the Luxor is still pretty good. Though there’s a no smoking policy in rooms it seems to be accepted practice to smoke weed in the fire escapes. The smell then drifts into corridors and rooms near the fire escape.    On the first ask our room and corridor was refreshed but the smell soon returns. The Luxor is apparently extremely busy so we couldn’t be offered a new room at the same grade or one higher. We were offered a downgrade to a basic room but no refund.    I get vegas is a party town but the stench of weed was too much for me.
50,Easy check in using app. Never waited in line or talked to any staff. Parking was easy using app. Just remember to pull up room key before getting in elevator. No internet in elevator and it’s required to get to floor.
50,Very beautiful hotel. Conveniently located to everything in Vegas. A lot to see and do in one building. Food portions were huge but expensive. Rooms are a very nice size. Very friendly and helpful staff
50,Was very clean and very comfortable. I enjoyed staying there. It was very safe and very comfortable. Very good workers and staffs  excellent service there. Everything was all secure and was just very calm and peaceful
30,Hotel was beautiful but the representative at the check in was very rude didn't activate my room correctly for the parking & elevator so I had to go back in line and still couldn't park. The roo. Curtains the tops a bunch of dust fell in my eye when I open them. Then when I grabbed a towel the last day right before we left a roach fell out that was so gross! If that was the case when we got there we would of left. I have asthma and I'm allergic so makes sense why my asthma was acting up! So I'm really annoyed with that.
30,Stay on a lower floor and make sure u do not fall for more in a room because it's not necessary. Get your own personal items because the ones here do not work. The hot water take a long time to get to your 25th floor.
50,We took our family to Vegas for the weekend and stayed in a suite at the Luxor. Everything went great we had a good time at the pools loved our room staff was helpful and friendly. Good variety of table games and machines. All around fun getaway.
50,Went on a last minute Family trip. The app made it easy to check in & out. The room was clean and pool area was a great environment. Tender Steakhouse was a great experience. The food was delicious and service was great.
30,AC not working the best. I got the view on the airport. Scammed with timeshare program. Far away from everything. Wasnt able to use shuttle for anything. Food prices are absolutely horrible. Drinks are free if you play if you want to wait 30 minutes to receive one. Other than that your paying 8.50 for a beer. But this is in every location.
50,Excellent and prompt customer service. Great value as a rewards member. Lots of food and beverage options throughout the casino. Only thing I dislike is the shower not having a door water sprinkled on the floor and people leave their trash in the hallway. Not the resorts fault.
50,I usually stay at the Luxury every time i go to Las Vegas.  Atmosphere is great. Everyone there is very helpful and attentive to your needs. Can't really say anything bad about this casino. Myself and 2 of my sons stayed at Lucky and we really enjoyed the slots.
10,I think it is completely unacceptable that we had a suite with no running water. No brushing our teeth no washing our hands no showers. What kind of crap is that? It totally ruined our time here at Luxor and will not be back.
50,My birthday week was fabulous. The staff was friendly and accommodating. Rooms were clean and updated. Would definitely stay here again. Spa services were excellent that I had to do it more than once.
50,Our stay was great! Housekeeping was efficient front desk was helpful and the water pressure in the shower is amazing. The waitress in the casino was prompt and helpful as well and I look forward to my next trip back!
50,Just completed a 7 night stay in a Tower Elite King room which was great for the price ( apart from the resort fee I wish hotels would just roll this cost into the daily rate ). I highly recommend guests staying in any of the MGM resorts download the MGM Resorts App which will save you a lot of time at check in. You are able to checkin 10 days out and on the day of arrival after 14:00pm you are allocated your room and issued your digital key meaning you can skip the crazy checkin desks and go straight to your room the digital key works with the lifts too. If you prefer to have the standard plastic keg card there are self service kiosks near the standard checkin area were you are able to collect the cards.    My room was clean and comfortable with daily housekeeping carried out without any prompting and done first thing so by the time I returned in the afternoon it was all done. Having a mini fridge and small prep area along with comfortable chairs meant I could relax in peace. The bed was comfortable and the A/C worked well. The bathroom clean and supplied with plenty of lotions and potions water pressure was an issues but I understand this is a city wide issue due to the lack of water generally.    There is still no room service at this hotel due to covid operations but you can pre order from some restaurants via the app or television for collection. There is a good selection of food outlets with the added bonus of covered walkways to the Mandalay Bay and Excalibur meaning there are plenty of options. The free tram that runs from the Mandalay Bay to Excalibur/ New York New York hotels ( stops at Luxor on return) is up and running.    The pool area is partially open with plenty of free sun loungers but none offered any shade unless you pay for an umbrella or cabana I think it’s a bit mean not to be able to have a free umbrella especially with the vegas sun.    All the staff I encountered were friendly and professional seeing vegas Sunday to Thursday being notably quiet and lacking the normal hustle and bustle was sad and I hope things continue to recover at pace so this wonderful city once again shines.
50,Stayed at the Luxor for 6 nights in May 2022 and we absolutely loved it! Our room was a great size and very clean. We were on floor 30 - the very top floor so we had a great view of Vegas and it was so quiet. We didnt see one other guest on our floor the entire time we were there and our room was serviced every second day.  Plenty to do in the hotel and it was easy to find your way around (compared to some of the other hotels). In particular the Titanic Exhibition was great. The pool area also looked very good but we did not spend any time there as we had so many other things planned. I liked that the hotel was on a slightly quieter part of the strip but still very close to the busy areas. Overall a great stay for us.
10,The hotel is very dirty and no one helps you locate the correct elevator or even takes the time to explain how to use the key card for the elevator. There were other guests that we took it upon ourselves to help in finding their correct elevator and even explained how to use the key card once you get on the elevator so it takes you to the correct floor. The cleaning people skip your room even when you tell them the room needs cleaning and sometimes at the end of your night when you get back to your room and just want to relax you can't because there is no linen on the bed and you have to call for bed sheets. Then you have to put the sheets on yourself because they just drop the sheets off to you.
50,We enjoyed the resort. Not too big. The pool was great as were the dining options. We really enjoyed Diablos Mexican dining. Staff was friendly as well. We have already booked a return stay. Thank you.
20,My husband and I recently stayed in a Corner Suite with a soaking tub (he thought it was a spa tub based on the pictures) to be very clear it is described as a soaking tub. The walk from parking to checkin was painfully long. Then we were not asked if we needed help with our bags after we were given our room#. The room was clean but the couch had a permanent sink hole in half of it. A lamp shade had a giant rip. Best part was having the listen to dogs yep and bark the ENTIRE duration of our stay. It was such an ordeal to get in to the hotel & get to the room on the 13th floor I didn't dare ask my husband if we could change rooms. We called the desk on the 1st night to ask that they send someone to unlock the safe - they never showed up. Another guest showed up the 2nd day trying to open our door - she had been given the SAME room as us! I did call customer service at 5 am the morning of the day we were leaving to let them know about all of it. I asked if she could at least waive the resort fees since we didn't use the amenities at all. Her response was if the dogs were bothering you then you should've let us know on the 1st day and we would've moved you. No one told us we would be staying on the puppy floor! This was supposed to be a belated anniversary trip - It was awful. If I wanted to hear noisy dogs I could've stayed home. At least we wouldn't have waisted our money on a sub par hotel.
50,We had an absolute blast.. First it's a Pyramid come on lol.. next the room. Bed was comfortable shower was great  housekeeping service was spot on. Fantasy was a great show ... Titanic experience was more then we could have hoped for  truly emotional experience. We checked in thru App  we arrive super early checked our bags at Bell desk & started to enjoy your Vegas vacation.. Pool was beautiful however we did not swim ONLY because we had so much to see and do . Every night we would come back to Luxor and pull some slots  grab some food or just chill 😎.. Thank you Luxor for your amazing service ..we will be back ..
50,Stayed in the Tower Elite King Room. It was clean spacious comfortable. Bed and pillows were comfy. Slots and table games were plentiful...Staff was professional and courteous. Casino was clean and spacious!
10,This resort just needs to be raised to the ground. Rooms are not as advertised. Got moved since the original room did not have a soaking tub. $10 more a night gor me when they lied about the room. The new room had a plumbing problem and flooded the floor from the soaking tub. They put towels down and said it would be OK. Never was asked if I wanted to move rooms or never offered a comp for our inconvenience. MGM sells one of its best in the Mirage and keeps this trash! Never stay here. Excalibur is better and that is saying a lot!
20,Luxor is great the new MGM rewards program is horrible..MGM properties had the Mlife rewards program which in over 40 years of coming to Las Vegas and having belonged to multiple reward programs WAS the best by far....Very easy to understand how to get tier credits tier multiplie rs rewards based on tier level express comps which were easy to use. Then they switched to this MGM rewards which not only doesnt reward the players for their coin in properly properly it is very murky with no way to tell how you are rewarded for play. I have NOIR status and they extended the earning period from 2021 thru the end of January 2022 and then carried over those tier credits to your 2022 total. I played new years day and the next day got 350000 tier credits and then came back forsuper bowl. Feb 1 thru the end of March they had a two times tier credits program. IO played harder during super bowl weekend where I normally would have had between 400000 to 500000 tier credits and being credits times 2 I should have been credited between 800000 and 1000000 tier credits. I barely got 150000 tier credits. The really shady thing is that my host his boss and anyone else I contacted cannot tell me how the tier credits are being accrued....Someone told me that high limit video poker is being scored at table game rates which anyone who has spent any time in a casino would never want. Table rate scoring on any game is a low estimate of what one actually wagers which is why I dont play table games. You are never scored or comped properly unless you are in a high limit salon playing.
20,Air filter was half an inch thick of dust. We spent the last 2/3’s of the trip having horrible allergies and sick the last few days from the continued breathing of all the dust being blown into our room. The last night we took the air filter cover off the HVAC and discovered this cause. We thought this may have been the reason it stayed so hot in the room to the point of sweating while sleeping but it didn’t improve the air but by around 3 degrees removing it. Highly likely I will not be back to the Luxor despite previously being my favorite place to stay while in town for week trips. This trip was Sun - Sat.
10,I’ve stayed at Luxor for many years but this past time was a fail. While taking a shower the water wouldn’t drain. Then nasty gunk and wads of hair began floating all around in the shower. It almost overflowed all over the floor.
20,Not the cleanest or most updated hotel. Our wall paint was peeling large wine stain (I hope…) on the wall stains on the towels and shower that just didn’t look clean. Perks are that they provide 3 comp nights and you can walk to Excalibur without going outside which has a better casino - Luxors is super small - but other than that I would likely not stay here again.
40,We always stay at the Luxor when we come to Vegas. We like that it’s not so crowded and busy like other hotels and it’s a good value. We rented a car and it was convenient that we could park at other MGM hotels without paying a fee.
50,I returned to the Luxor after four years because they had a two-bedroom suite available for me for three nights. The suite worked out great. It was 2 bedrooms with 2 bathrooms and two rooms in between them to relax in with a couch and refrigerator included. The view was fine also. I did have to wait until 4:00 to get into my room though. Ate breakfast a couple of times in the Pyramid Cafe and had a meal in Diablo's Cantina as well as the Food Court. Was very satisfied with the hotel and the casino. Good to see Vegas is back.
50,Our stay here was very good . Hotel room was clean  the pool was clean and pool waitresses were very attentive .it Was very kid friendly and we were able to buy moktails for him at the pool just have to ask. I will be coming back soon .
50,Despite the older wore down casino the rooms we’re actually pretty nice and comfortable! There’s good dinning options and staff was fantastic! I recommend getting a stay well or a suite. And the pool area was surprisingly nice with plenty of seating options!
50,Loved it! Staff was very welcoming and kind. Check in and out was easy. In house dining was great. Will stay here again. Room was large and clean. Bathroom was luxurious with a stand alone shower and large soaking tub.
50,Had a great view and the staff was helpful. I enjoyed the scenery and even the elevator was interesting since it went up at an angle. It was a little shaky on the way up which I didn’t care for but it was nice to know why that was. I would definitely go back again and stay here.
50,Great check in procedure. Yvonne was extremely helpful as we had three different sets of family coming at different times. Comfortable quiet room especially with all that was going on in the lobby and during EDC. Easy location to do things we wanted to do.
50,Stayed at the Luxor in may in a pyramid elite suite and it was awesome. It was on the 29 floor with a great view of the strip and airport it was huge something like 1300 sq feet and it was comped !! Split this trip between Luxor and Mirage where I usually stay but since it’s being rebranded to hard rock I will be back to stay at the Luxor ! Pool is very nice and the restaurants are good and I love that it’s connected to Mandalay Bay and Excalibur by tram or by walking without going outside. Saw carrot top and he was great and the titanic exhibit was very cool. Had a great time !
50,We had a lot of fun at the Luxor. It’s one of the more reasonable places on the strip with affordable room rates and table games. We stayed in a tower room which was beautiful. The bed was very comfortable which can be hard to find in a hotel and when you’re used to your own bed. Everyone we encountered was very friendly and helpful. The Luxor has a nice food court along with delicious restaurants. We also enjoyed visiting the Titanic and Bodies exhibitions located in Luxor. These exhibits were very informative and interesting. It was a nice break from “the strip” even though you’re still in the center of it. We highly recommend the Luxor!
40,It was nice as always just a few things that did not work properly. But when asked for assistance they were on top of it. Would come back again at another time. The hotel overall was neat and very clean environment
50,The employee who checked me in was kind and personable despite there being a long line. My room was so beautiful with a spectacular view of the mountains. It was super clean and the bed was very comfortable! I loved eating at the Pyramid Cafe. The food is more ‘home style’ 🥗😀
50,Customer service was phenomenal. We had our room upgraded and everyone was just great and friendly. We found out later there is a bus that will take you all the way up and down the strip which saved a lot of time. The hotel was clean and staff were so helpful really enjoyed ourselves….
50,from checking in to last day was awesome !! VIP lounge & personnel were great to work with ! Can’t wait until next trip . Suite was wonderful massages were superb . Food was great  Public house  Diablo’s  Buffet were all Great !
50,Always a good place to stay! Great food nice rooms and friendly staff! Can't beat the locationnice pool area reasonable prices for Spa services.lots of good food and shopping within walking distance.
50,It was fun and the employees were extremely helpful. The room and hotel/casino itself was clean. My stay wasn’t as long as I would have liked but the few days I was there were great id definitely stay at the this hotel again.
50,Everything was great hotel was clean was clean staff was extremely helpful and polite. Love the theme of the hotel and buffet was amazing. Only check in was easy and took less than 10 seconds to activate our room keys which i loved because you dont waste any of your vacation time trying to get to your room.
50,My girlfriend and I decided to take a trip alone and luxor was the perfect place to stay. we caught a few shows and did some gambling. Staying at the Luxor is so convenient because you are always close to everything on the strip and if you need transportation the tram system wil drop you off right in front of hotel.
50,Stay was perfect swing pool room is clean people very friendly restaurant food delicious l be back again with my family hotel is nice show very nice entertainment service excelente no problem whit anything
40,Over the last 15 years I've stayed at the Luxor Hotel which is one of the 15 or so resorts owned and run by MGM resorts property's and I've always have a good time even through this place is starting to show it's age and staying there you have 3 connected resorts and a great pool
50,Fantastic time. Lots to see and do within walking distance. The pools are relaxing. Easy access to Mandalay Bay and Excalibur via the free tram or covered walkways. In hotel exhibits were well worth the time to see. Very clean and friendly staff.
40,Rooms were extremely clean for an older facility. We ate at the Pyramid for breakfast and the staff was excellent and the food was very good. Diablo Cantina had e great bartenders and great drinks. everyone was very helpful.
50,Love the Luxor my son got married in Vagas  There were 37 of us staying at the hotel. Best time ever My son and daughter in law stay in the pent house. It was awesome 👌 great places inside the Luxor to eat and shop.
50,Great resort! Everyone all staff I encountered were very helpful and nice. I would definitely stay here again. I loved all the Egyptian themed monuments and statues. Shopping and restaurants were great as well. Bed were comfortable rooms were big clean bathrooms had nice tub and amazing shower. Very cool place
50,We had a great stay for two nights. Our room was just fine and everyone was very helpful.  Just wish we could have opened the window but we understood that’s hard to do in a pyramid. :-) I have stayed at the Luxor before and would certainly do it again.
50,Dog friendly hotel. Everything but one thing was perfect. That one thing is the aircon was not able to cool down the room at a high rate during the hot mid day. Maybe there was a problem with the aircon but it was not a major problem were it needed to be reported. Will be back to visit again.
50,We stayed at the Luxor purely as a lay-over prior to flying back home after a week long trip to Death Valley National Park and Yosemite. Love the digital key capability - no need to waste time standing in line getting a key! The room was nice and more than sufficient for our needs.
50,The hotel and amenities were amazing. We enjoyed the Egyptian theme and the pool. The pyramid cafe was a great choice for breakfast and Jordan was an incredible server. The only negative was constantly being pushed to go to a timeshare presentation for free vouchers.
40,We were pleased with our comped rooms (great size 1&2 BR suites). This was our first stay at any MGM property and they gave us better rooms than properties we had visited before.  Gambling was not good for us here had much better luck at other properties... but that's gambling.  We were disappointed with restaurant hours but that's most likely due to covid and staffing issues. Not much open late and buffet was closed for 2 days of our stay.  Location would be GREAT for a Raiders game... but not ideal for seeing more of the strip. We had some older people in our party (70+) and it was too much walking (so we spent more on cab fares to get us to places).  Overall we enjoyed our stay. The comped rooms are a huge reason for this review.
40,Room was kept clean and in order. Prices for the week reasonable. Staff was friendly and cordial. Plenty of choices for food. Only drawback was we had a car and was surprised that we had to pay for parking . When we parked in other hotels parking was free.
40,didn't like the walk from self parking to check in too long for me personally. rooms were nice.need coffee maker and microwave in room. nice selection of food in casino. nice location of casino on strip
40,Room was ok staff were friendly had to wait a long time for them to come open the room safe as it was locked from previous guests but housekeeping brought the requested blankets right away. Pool was good and rented cabana was very nice with great service
40,Got there Monday 10:30 AM lognormal luggage it was my girlfriends birthday the next day that Tuesday 24 May we go out on a presentation come back to the hotel after six in the room still was not ready we went to priority check in I guess we got checked in around 6:30 PM other than that I had a great time the staff at the hotel was great no other issues I’m used to having a microwave in my room and a coffee maker in my room I didn’t have had a good time
20,There are much better hotel options on the strip. The Luxor is disconnected from the main action which means long walks to everything. It seemed like every hotel we passed through was better in almost every way.
50,I travel to Vegas a lot and only stay at 2 hotels. I absolutely love the Luxor for so many reasons. The location staff restaurants casino and room quietness make every trip so nice. I was just there in May and scheduled to come back in June
50,Great Customer Service Luxor staff was very atentive to my needs and extremely help with my disability needs. Most importantly but not forgotten My Safety in the Hotel.  Love the security access in and out of my stay while I visited.
20,Pros: Free Room very comfortable bed nearby food options  Cons: Oddly renovated bad elevators dingy hotel and TOO MUCH SMOKE    Had an offer to stay and thought why not as we'd never stayed in that hotel before. Felt a bit panicky as I had read some really bad reviews.    Check-in: Terrible process. We knew we'd have to check our bags as we arrived early. We waited in a very long line to be put on a list to call when the room was ready and then waited in a very long line to check our bags. About 30 mins later we received a text that room was ready. We were told to use electronic check in to get our room keys. We spent 20 mins trying to get room keys as it wouldn't recognize our driver's licence so then we had to wait in a very long line again to see agent. There should be a better process for check in.    The Room: While in line two separate guests told us about their nightmare rooms. One showed us that he was given a room with no showerhead! How can that even be! The other guest told us he was given a room that had cockroaches! This gave me great anxiety and I mentioned it to agent that I hope we ended up with a good room. She said that guests bring cockroaches with them and that also guests get the rooms they pay for. We were getting a premier pyramid room so we would be fine. I didn't get her rationale as I thought that all guests should have an actual shower head and NO cockroaches no matter how much they pay for a room. I think a bit of coaching in regard to what she said might be helpful.    View from the room: Our room faced the pool and part of the roof. Wasn't that great to look at but we're not in the room much. On the outside hallway it overlooked the roof of the structures in the food court. It was a very quiet floor but really ugly to look over the balcony outside the room door and see all the garbage that people have thrown down below on the inside of the casino.    Hotel Renovation: We were told that the entire hotel was renovated. But that is actually smoke and mirrors as the rooms are not entirely renovated. In fact it looks like they only renovated a few things - like bathroom counters headboards but left ancient artwork and tired mirrors that were falling apart. The bathroom shower ceiling had spackling put on it that was peeling and falling on the ground. Overall the room was clean and the best part of the room was how comfortable the bed was. It was like a big pillow.    Elevators: The key card system on these elevators are hit and miss. Half the time we were riding the elevators sideways back and forth trying in vain to get our cards to work. We did find that only one swipe worked and you had to hold your card at just the right angle. And yes the elevators move sideways in the pyramid as opposed to up and down and yes they creak as if they are going to bust apart at any moment.    Smoke in the casino: It's like ventilation doesn't work in this casino.The smoke was so bad that we elected to spend a lot of our time at Park MGM which is smoke free. In 2022 I can't believe that Vegas hasn't gone smoke free already. Or at the very least make a smoking room for those who want to smoke and gamble. We would have spent way more money in the casino if we weren't battling second hand smoke everywhere.    The pool: 4 pools I believe but the strangest set up. The pool area really does need an overhaul and at least plant a few more trees. I get the Egyptian theme but with only one pool open on a 100F degree day on pure cement with no shade it's a bit too much. Plus the chairs were old and worn and there were cigarette butts all under the chairs. Really gross. Also really gross that in the back area there was always someone smoking dope. If you want to smoke dope then fine but I shouldn't have to smoke it with you because the casino seems to be allowing it. Also every day we were at the pool there seemed to be someone who was either drugged out or black out drunk and security's answer was to plop them in a wheelchair in the hot sun and leave them there. That can't be the proper way to help people who can get heat stroke on top of overdosing.    Food options: One thing that I really appreciated about this casino is the location to quick food options. There's a couple of Starbucks and there's a food court. If you walk just a bit further towards Mandalay there's also more food options. Sometimes after a night of drinking you just want a quick burger and not a full meal. I also appreciated the 24/7 shop on the main floor of the casino that had Subway subs in there and we grabbed those a few times for a fast snack at 4am.    All in all this hotel is in dire need of an update and a proper renovation. I can see how this place must have been the place to be when it opened but there's just too many dated and dirty things in this hotel now. Plus the ventilation really needs to be upgraded. It is a perfectly fine hotel if you want a cheap place to stay and little details don't matter to you.
50,I loved the mobile app. Made getting to my room super easy. Just waited at the bar and followed directions to my room. Would be wild if it had GPS tracking to the room with the GPS tiles but maybe that tech isnt yet ready. Bringing wife back next time
50,The room was nice it was very clean it was huge and comfortable a lot of space everything was good I will return to the hotel again. I would like the pool to be open later as it is hot during the mid day
40,Suites are a little outdated but overall a great place to stay the staff is friendly and the place is clean and well kept was not able to attend the buffet it was closed the week we were there but overall a great and affordable place to stay
40,Complimentary stay booking on holiday weekend rooms were available over the phone for same day! Room was somewhat clean and in need of repairs but for complimentary booking can’t complain too much. Staff members were courteous. Pay overnight parking ahead of time and save!
30,Hotel experience was ruined after our 1st room started leaking water on bed. After being relocated completely on other side of hotel and very far 23rd floor it was a hassle moving our luggage since we had reserved for 2 night stay.
30,I wouldn’t say this is the best hotel I’ve stayed at by any means. The only good things I could mention include the beds views different locations within the hotel and some of the front desk. We came from Burbank California and were on our way back to Kansas City Missouri. I was extremely interested in the Luxor and had wanted to stay since I was young. Thus my father bought a room for him my girlfriend and I. We arrived at approximately 11:00PM and had to wait in line until about midnight. We were all extremely exhausted fighting headaches and simply wanted to eat and go to bed. After waiting in line for a hour we finally received a room that was all the way on the 19th floor. Once checking out the room we went back down to the self-park to get our stuff and head back to the room to relax. Back in the room my girlfriend went to go take a shower and found that the water was not working. So I called down to the front desk and they informed me that the water was shut down until 4AM on the east tower. By this point and time it was 1:00AM. We headed down to the front desk to get new hotel keys for a new room. Finally we got food went to our room ate took showers and went to bed around 3AM. Overall while there was comfort it was extremely frustrating to wait in line for a room then be sent to a room where they knew there was no water. I was upset because I had planned for my girlfriend and father to have a great experience while it ended up being an average experience to say the least.
50,If you stay at the Luxor hotel I recommend staying inside the pyramid and not the towers u get better view from outside as well as the inside of the hotel and rooms seem bigger to me I side the pyramid.
50,We stayed at the Luxor for 4 days to celebrate our twin daughter's 21st birthday. The rooms were clean the beds were comfy and the staff were great. Best of all they are military friendly. No only did we get a discount on the room we got and instant upgrade to pearl in their rewards program so our parking was FREE!
10,Had issues with rooms the staff switched us twice didn’t offer anything for the inconvenience what a GREAT honeymoon! Do yourself a favor stay somewhere else this hotel is outdated and needs a lot of work.
10,Total disappointment! Room was filthy looks like it wasn’t even cleaned hallway rugs were old and dirty. Strong odor of some sort of cleaner in hallways. Elevators were rickety and scary. Will not be returning
50,Great location on the strip friendly staff. Was a little disappointed that there was no mini fridge in the room other wise it was great. The America's got talent show was something to experience and would highly recommend!
30,The showers are strange without doors or curtains lots of water out of showers. The air conditioning needs to be improved and the elevators need some TLC. Too much carryover smoke from casino. Smoking should be outlawed.
30,They no longer provide rooms with refrigerators or coffee makers unless you rent the refrigerator. Food has gone up on price and we believe the alcohol is being watered down. Minimum cocktail waitresses around the machines and a rude bartender who made it obvious we were an inconvenience when we sat down to play the machines at the bar.
10,We stayed 7 nights at the Luxor and three days weren’t even in our room because we were traveling to enjoy our vacation to come back to our room where the bed wasn’t made no towels and absolute no room service. It was 2a when we returned back to our room obviously exhausted and the front desk manager Garrett stated we are just one of 4400 and they will get to us. Absolutely disgraceful customer service and I will never recommend or come back to the Luxor
10,Dirty room  To much walking  Check In was forever  Charge for parking makes no sense since we were guest ! I will never go there again should have kept my other reservation I had at another resort. Also there was no fridge which sucked.
50,Had such a great time at the Luxor!! The room was nice clean and comfortable. All the staff was very helpful and had such a great time! Next time for sure I want to see a show at the Luxor next time just didn’t have enough time to do it.
50,As a first timer I really enjoyed my time in Vegas. Won't bring the kiddo next time but enjoyed the time with my family. Looking forward to my next visit. Maybe a girls trip one day! I definitely want to check out the shows!
20,Place was in a great location. Upon checking in I was talked to rudely and given no greeting. The staff acted like it was inconvenient that I was even there. Their attitude seemed to change a bit when they saw I was a rewards member. The room was nice but the shower was missing a door! The room never serviced in its own. I had to request a service.
20,Overall a bad experience but you get what you pay for. From the very start check in was a disaster because the use of keycards in the elevator. Took us about 10 minutes to finally get it to work. Another reason for the low review is that they did not honor their military discount.
50,The newly renovated room are amazing!!! Great service and they make you feel at home. Thank you Luxor staff for the great stay. If you have any doubts about staying here book your stay now and get down to Las Vegas asap!!!
40,We stay in the premier one bedroom suite in the east tower and it was great. I was there with my wedding party and everyone enjoyed their stay. There was a slight issue with the cleanliness of one of our wedding guest rooms. The design of this hotel is tricky because of the distance between the rooms in the tower to the casino. But overall our stay was pleasant.
10,Overall bad experience. Woken up my housekeeping 2 times with on of the times housekeeping coming into the room. Wife was freaked out and we decided to leave the hotel early. All this happened hours before our checkout time
40,Hotel room was dated. Drain had a problem in the shower. bathroom was not cleaned. Problems taken care of within a reasonable time over the phone. Too far to walk back to the front desk. Pool would've been better if they had all the pools open.
50,Having read reviews prior to my visit in April 2022 I was regretting my decision of booking the Luxor. However I had an absolutely fantastic stay and I would happily recommend it to anybody. We stayed in a Tower Premier Two Queen room in the West Tower. The room was super clean it was a great size the AC worked well the room was quiet and the views were beautiful.    Although the property is on the south end of the strip we didn't find it an issue at all. The tram that connects with Excalibur and Mandalay Bay is great. We also got an Uber down towards the centre of the strip a few times when we were feeling a little tired and it was inexpensive.    We enjoyed our stay in the Luxor that much that we have booked again for next year!
20,We've stayed here several times over the years but this was probably our last time. The hotel is simply put: tired. So many maintenance issues. Our room door didn't latch unless you pulled upon the handle. We didn't realize we'd been leaving our room unsecured until our last day. Shower had no pressure. toilets hardly ever flush propertly. Pool noise excessive. Stay elsewhere.
10,Service was not great understaffed and nobody knows who their bosses might be? Issues with the rooms are not properly addressed on time and there may be problems with electrical as well as decor falling apart and old furniture. Not the best value for over 200 bucks a night.
30,Rooms need updating. Probably won’t stay here again. AC issues. Musty smell. Gross carpet. Small television. Room was clean. Loved the app check in. Didn’t have to stand in line. Amazing. Buffet was decent. Wouldn’t recommend if you have to pay full price. Nice being connected to Mandalay Bay. Americas got talent was fun show.
50,I traveled to Vegas on a trip with friends and was skeptical about the stay due to some bad reviews I read online. I was very impressed with the room and the hotel. The room was completely remodeled and clean which was an initial concern for me after reading reviews. I thought it was great quality for the rate and would definitely stay again.
30,Friendly staff good food choices. Not a convenient walk to the strip. Hallways very dirty. Bed very firm. Sheets scratchy. Glasses were dirty. Low shower water pressure. Low shower head height. Long confusing walk to find proper elevator for your area.
40,Clean room with an upgrade to 32 floor. Great staff everything was wonderful. Close to the Duece bus stop but it is at the end of the strip. Another plus there is a tram and a walk thru to Mandalay bay.
30,The cleaning crew kept turning if the air conditioning so the room was very hot we called them and asked them to stop but they kept doing it anyways. Also they THREW away our $78 meal we had in the room! Awful
40,Good price for weekday trip on the trip. Nice room but restaurant selection is very limited. I would avoid all restaurants in the Luxor and Excalibur with the exception of the buffets. No hdmi hookup for the tv in the room. Be prepared to walk though different casinos to get anywhere.
50,This hotel was great! I went for my birthday and had an amazing time. I wish the pool stayed open later but there was so much to do in the hotel that I didnt worry about it. Will definitely stay here again
10,Incorrect bed sizes broken bathroom fans charged my card twice. Dirty sticky fridge. After i had mentioned these things to our front desk it was just like an “oops sorry. best of luck to u all not our problem.” very unfortunate and disappointing we usually love staying here.
30,Luxor is a good basic hotel. Rooms are nice and clean. Plenty of space and updated. The hotel is great for your value and plenty to do and see. My only complaint would be the elevators. The elevators are in need of replacement big time! Dirty and the card readers are difficult to work. Don’t do the electronic key go and get a physical key card as the electronic key barely works!
50,My stay here at the Luxor was a getaway from LA. I worked to my wits end and needed a quick trip to decompress and the Luxor delivered. The Egyptian theme is different from everything you see on the Vegas strip and the affords rooms make it a very enticing destination!
40,Great hotel only place I stay in Vegas. Love the music and the atmosphere. Only problem is that the stairs are filthy and completely neglected. They need a thorough deep cleaning asap! Do better Luxor!
50,Hotel was ok. Noticed many issues / cosmetic issues in the 2B elevators. Opening panels poor facial coverings  hard to read ID card / cel phone transponder inside elevator car. 9th wall has wall.paper peeling. It is a easy repair  should.not be left like that. It is not a good look.
40,It’s a nice hotel very clean and friendly staff air conditioner was not that great in the room but at our friends rooms were great . It’s in a really cool location everything is around the casino I recommend to stay
50,We did not get the room we requested -- the pyramid room we were assigned was not as nice as the tower one-room suite we had booked -- there was no privacy between the bedroom and living room areas. A different room was not available the next day . . .
20,Our room was nothing special. They should sell the rooms that have the window looking straight at a wall at a different price level. We got the short end and not made very comfortable when being it up on an emailed survey.    Lots of timeshare hasslers. Entertainment and food were good enough
40,We have stayed at the Luxor numerous times so are familiar with it. Service is always decent but I was disappointed that they no longer offer Pai Gow in the Casino and that all the minimum bets have been increased. I guess corporate greed isn’t restricted to oil companies.
40,The hotel room is good but there is no fridge in the room. Beside that is a good place to stay with the family. The bed is good. Also the cleanness. I can recommend Luxor Las Vegas to friends and family.
40,Pretty nice Casino on the Strip with a good deal for us. Room was really nice shower great comfort good. Some buggy things that were annoying like a boring concrete pool landscape with little shade and blasting music and dirty towels and stuff everyhwere a parking garage where many people struggle to exit creating long lines. The mobile app - excellent functionality checking in a breeze sharing the key parking - but you can't check out on the app.
30,The room was nice and clean but compared to a motel 6 lacked amenities. A refrigerator is required for diabetics but a microwave and coffee maker are amenities that you find in motel 6 or other places.
10,Had a great trip until I was woken up at 1 in the morning with the ceiling leaking water on my bed. And staff acted like it happens all the time. Got my resort fees waived Not very satisfied with the resolution.
20,Not the best stay. Only good because it is cheap. But with that 50/50 shot your AC is not going to work properly. The entire hotel smells like heavy cigarette compared to other hotels. Inside the Hotel is clean and staff is friendly.
50,Easy check in with mobile app and beats waiting in line. Clean room and secure with elevator and door access through mobile app. Fun variety of slots and table games with lots of food options if desired.
50,I got there early and was able to do the mobile check-in and was able to get a room!! The shower was amazing!!!! The staff was helpful at all cost the hotel was clean inside and out  best place to stay!!
30,Overall it wasn’t too bad for the price. We had a jacuzzi room. The first one the AC wasn’t working. When we called they switched us to another. The second room had used/empty shampoo bottles. The AC never worked all that well either in that room but it was better. The TV system is outdated with bad reception and few channels. The gambling situation was good and the food selection isn’t bad at all either. We would stay again but just keep our expectations low.
50,Great place it was difficult at first to navigate the signs and find things but we figured it out after a couple days. All the food we ate inside the luxor was great as well but a little pricey. We definitely want to come back again. It was almost at one end of the strip which took some time to make your way to see other places. We did walk almost to the stratosphere and halfway back before we just got an uber.
50,The saff was friendly and helpful. I enjoyed the location and train as well as mall. We were able to see and visit areas of the strip that we never have before. The view was also beautiful…We will stay here again!
50,They offer so many free room and show tickets I was very pleased ! Felt I got so much great value for being a rewards member! Great shows also! Highly recommend!    Also it’s so great for returning trips because there always so many stones left unturned! Endless experiences in Vegas !
10,We have videos of room when we checked in and it was horrible stay  Guest service were very rude (David Jenna lilly) we have proof of the type of services provided to us  Very unprofessional and hotel room quality was very dirty
20,The hotel was very dated & overall dirty. The elevators need quite a few repairs & there are no room amenities. The rooms are quite dated & they make you rent a mini fridge. In addition I will say that if you are claustrophobic you should NOT stay here. The rooms are tight & rather dark.
30,Every staff member that we encountered was excellent (except the in house Starbucks). Food at Public House and Tender Steakhouse was very good. The Buffet was very disappointing and expensive for what it offered. Our room was nice and spacious but no in room coffee maker frig or microwave. No where to get free coffee or even water anywhere. We made a Target run and used one of our room trashcans to ice down drinks. Hallways and public areas are looking run down. Trash was not cleared in room hallways and vacuuming not done. Wallpaper peeling and wrinkling worn and faded carpeting. You had to walk through smoking areas of Casino to get anywhere. You had to walk through clouds of marijuana smoke to get from the hotel to the self parking lot. Pool area was full of smoke and loud music. The facade of the back of the outside of the pyramid is coming apart - even the lighting running up and down has outages and spots where the color isn't right. If you are just looking for a place to lay your head it's an expensive one but the staff is just phenomenal!
40,I actually liked this hotel it was one of the cheaper hotels on the strip so that's why we stayed there. Obviously it pales in comparison to some of the nicer hotels (bellagio etc) but you get what you pay for. The rooms were quite modern cleaning wasn't the best there were splash marks of god knows what up the walls (looked like coca cola or coffee) but the bed and bathroom was clean. We also noticed no one emptied our bin until we left a tip. The hotel has good selection of bars and food although I will say the food court is extremely expensive $15 for a can of beer! Wow. The casino is good the gerneal feel of the hotel is quite dark though however it is a pyramid so it's keeping with the theme. The staff were friendly and the pool was really really nice!! Only downside is it's right on one end of the strip so it takes ages to get anywhere on foot.
50,Had a great time with the family. Great people at the Luxor and the location is perfect. Tram and other casino access through the bridges is great. May be a bit expensive but it was memorial day weekend so it was a bit expected. Great time May weather is very tolerable in Nevada.
50,I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at the Luxor. Staff members were extremely friendly during check-in and check-out and my room was clean and well maintained. The bed and the pillows were extremely comfortable. I would definitely recommend staying at the Luxor.
50,We had a great time at Luxor. We were looking for a place to spend time after EDC Vegas and Luxor allowed us to relax. In addition it's close to the heart of the strip so we were able to venture out when we wanted. I would stay here again.
40,Checking in had a hard time because the internet connection was bad found some trash in my room that didn’t belong to me when I checked in. But overall the 5 days I stayed was smooth and great! I would definitely comeback but double check if the room is clean before settling in
50,Anytime I come to Vegas I’m staying at the Luxor!! Wonderful food great staff. The fact that you can visit 3 different casinos without ever stepping outside is awesome. Not much of a gambler but I found myself enjoying the slots.
10,this place needs to be redone. the room was so hot and they didnt even let us change rooms that when house keeping was in the room making up the bed she was sweating. the A/C although it was working would not cool down the room and besides the unit itself was all busted. we also waited at midnight to check in over an hour because they only had two people working... totally a horrible experience
20,The air conditioner in our room would either shut off or blow hot air. Called for help and nobody ever showed up. Room temp at one time was 85°! Had to buy batteries and change the batteries in the thermostat to get some relief. Room was not clean. The was a bar of soap still in the shower from the last tenants. No extra toilet paper. This was our 20th wedding anniversary we were very unhappy with the room.
10,I don’t feel that I got what I paid for. There is no Fridge microwave or coffee maker in the room. There is not a complete shower door so water is all over the floor. Clothes from the previous guest were left in the drawer. The hotel and casino were super stuffy.
50,Staff was extremely friendly and helpful.. the room was very clean and services were great. Check in and checkout were very efficient. We would strongly recommend this hotel while staying in Las Vegas.
50,This unique location is not only convenient location wise it’s comfortable and accommodating. With its fascinating facade and remarkable architecture you’ll want to re book your stay soon after you leave. Stunning views from within the atrium some of the best slots in Las Vegas and some fine dining. Conveniently connected to Mandalay Bay and Excalibur with quick strip access you won’t need to spend much on transportation if you’re staying within the area. I’m in love the Luxor.
40,Got corner deluxe suite. Great value for the money and the room was confortable. The rooms are not crazy luxurious; if you want fancy go spend quadruple the amount at the Bellagio. Absolutely would stay again without a question. The elevators can be a little slow when busy.
30,The room had some issues. The hotel was a good experience. The buffet was great. The pool Paty was a lot of fun. The location of the hotel is conveniently close to all the action. The over all experience was good.
30,Luxor works in a pinch but other properties are better. It's more the clientele thats also staying with you. Lot of sweat pants nascar and fubu shirts. The staff is great and pool area is very large.
10,Run down outdated bare bones room. Didn’t even have a fridge. The room was cheap but I would rather pay double and stay somewhere that I didn’t think was disgusting. Note to management: this place needed a remodel 20 yrs prior!
40,I've stayed at this hotel plenty of times  This particular time I got the corner suite and it was huge I loved it. Very clean. The only concern was parking be prepared to pay for parking. I guess once COVID hit the parking was free at one point so I never noticed you had to pay for parking. I was not told you can add the parking on the room bill to be able to go in and out of the hotel. I ended up paying 30 bucks just in one day. After it was explained I should only pay 15 bucks per 24 hours. I wasn't told to use my room key but again that's if you pay with the hotel for parking is what I was told after the fact. Then in order to get comp parking you have to be at a certain tier for rewards. Another Fyi. But over all it's a nice place to stay. Just a few hiccups. I remember the girl that checked me in was very new and never even seen the mgm gift cards so it's totally not her fault that it wasn't all explained to me. But maybe you guys should train your staff fully before throwing them out. Las Vegas is very busy and I felt bad she had to call for help.
10,I called prior for bringing a dog i checked in at 8 pm kept our dog and went out came back at 3 am tired drunk tried opening my room it was locked my wife waited outside while i ran to reception for my keys he fixed keys i went back tried opening room same thing it didnt open i went back this happened 3 times i was super tired as distance was too far from my room to reception..from west wing to lobby i was angry and asked why it is not opening now manager comes and says it was locked because of your dog was barking i asked him why you did not tell me the first time i came you let me walk 4 times back and fourth at 4 am to tell me the reason he said i dont have an answer sorry ..so specially asked room with dog paid $50 each night for my room was locked out because my dog barked lol strange so i had to drop my dog at hostel next morning paid $220 paid luxor$100 for 2 night which my dog didn't stay no apology nothing ..i parked my car at elixbur hotel next door as there were no parking at my own hotel luxor over all guys if you want to enjoy vegas please spend some more money staying at standard hotels like venetian balazio miraj or cosmo avoid running down neglecting guests hotels spoied my long weekend
50,I was really excited to go las. Vegas and stay in Luxor !!  And I have no regrets cause I love the casino and the state and I Definitely going back again to have the same experience that I had this first time did a basic Luxor in hotel casino. Pool and food experience excise my spectating I’m going back again
50,Nice clean rooms plenty of slots food choices and shows. Would recommend to family and friends as a place to stay if you want to have a good time good sleep and good food to enjoy shows and all of the above.
50,We chose the Luxor because of the unique architecture and the affordable price. Although it is at the far end of the strip there are several resorts/activities within walking distance and with quick Uber service you can get wherever you need/want to go in minutes. Although the hotel is older we found it to be very well maintained clean and with comfortable quiet rooms. The pool area is beautiful and poolside drinks were wonderful. Overall we very much enjoyed our stay.
10,We checked out and left our garment bag hanging in the closet full with suits dress shirts blouses. We called 4 hours later and asked security to check the room and lost and found. Nothing. Put a claim in with lost and found nothing. No one can give us any answers. The maid service is allowed to take what they find no questions asked.
40,The resort theme was awesome! Staff were friendly and check-in was quick and easy! Hotel room was nice clean and updated! The elevators can be a far walk and the resort is far from center strip but otherwise it’s a great place to stay! Enjoyed my trip!
40,We stayed in the 2 bedroom West Tower Elite Suite for 6 nights during EDCLV it was spacious and very comfortable for 4 adults. Bedrooms are located on the opposite sides of the suite for privacy with the living room dining room and wet bar located in between. All amenities and furniture were upgraded and clean. The casino is a little dated and smells heavily of smoke but we enjoyed our time. The pools are relaxing. Food options we tried in the hotel were good like the Blizz Public House and Backstage Deli and would recommend all. Check in was a bit difficult and took about 5 hours to gain access to the entire suite due to miscommunication from the cleaning crew. For the convenience of a short walk to our EDC shuttles at the Tropicana and comfortable beds and suite we would definitely stay here again for the value.
10,We were locked out of our room for 3 hours and front desk thought we were drunk but in reality the battery on the hotel door was dead. The person at the front desk basically laughed in our faces because we couldn’t get into our room. Manager was standing there and he was no help at all. They ended up having to call a technician. After a hour of one technician trying to open the door he had to call two other technician to basically brake the door down. In total we were locked out of our room for more than 4 hours and all we wanted to do was rest. Very disappointed in how the front desk and manager handled everything. They acted like it wasn’t their problem.
40,The front desk and cleaning staff were so intensely kind and helpful it really made an intense work trip more relaxing and bearable.The room is a little older and the shower could use a second door but the staff made those concerns less noticeable.
40,The Luxor is a nice hotel that is linked to the Mandalay Bay and Excalibur. The rooms are nice but a little dated. Plan to do a lot of walking just to get to the elevators. If you having any health issues ask to be close to the elevators or you'll have to walk a lot to get to them. The pool closes very early but then all of them do in Vegas.  Sean at the casino bar is extremely nice and helpful to newbies. Esther a waitress in the casino by the bar is also great. They were both very nice and helpful and if you're a newbie to Vegas I know we needed all the help we could get to understand how things worked.  The food was okay but nothing exceptional but we did not eat at the Buffet. We ate at Diablo's and we were not impressed but then I don't like spicy food. Public had good food and service.  People smoked marijuana everywhere the lobby the rooms the casino it's everywhere. Even though there are signs everywhere saying not to smoke it on the property no one said anything to those who were. It smells horrible in most places due to the marijuana. I understand it's legal there but seriously some of us don't like it and would have greatly appreciated them enforcing their policies. It would also be great if they just make a smoking area outside for people who want to smoke marijuana and cigarettes. It's their choice but it's also my choice not to smoke and we shouldn't have to be subjected to their choices but we were and that is everywhere. All the hotels we visited were pretty much the same in that aspect.  Overall Luxor is a nice hotel.
10,I made reservations for 2 rooms at the same time... we were put on SEPARATE floors. The rooms did not even have refrigerators unless u 'rented' one or got one delivered for medical reasons. EVERYTHING was WAY over cost.. the F&B add on to the room was NOT worth it and you can't use it everywhere in the casino/hotel. There was even graffiti carved into the floor indicators of the elevators.. not to mention the dog park is a joke and a VERY long walk from towers... for a dog that needs to go soon that is pretty bad.. and also putting my Mom and her dog in a room at the FURTHEST end of the hall on her floor when she has a dog to take out! The ONLY reason I picked this casion/hotel was b/c of the pyramid and pet acceptance... NOT WORTH IT AT ALL!
50,Casino experienced was awesome from the beginning to the end.The quality of food is also good no complaints.The connection with other casinos without going outside is the best of Luxor to check out the concerts at house of blues.
50,Bachelor party had good service and decent rooms. For the money there is not really a better value in the strip. They also have a great casino atmosphere. The rooms had beds made and were cleaned every time we left for more than 4 hours.
30,Luxor was as expected no the best but not the worst for the price …could be updated looks a bit old when looking around the room lack of Mini fridge was a bust and having to use the room key on elevator was annoying
30,No refrigerator no microwave. AC was broken. TV stations were fuzzy and no guide to find shows without going thru them individually. Casino was hot in some areas cold in others. Escalators were not working.
30,Parking was horrible I even tried valet parking but they were helping people that were giving them money  More than an hour to find where to park two of the entrances were closed with no signage where to go or anything
50,We came to see Blue Man Group show was excellent. Room was very nice and clean. Stayed in West Tower. Every employee that we encountered were always helpful and friendly. Dinner at Tender the Steakhouse was excellent.
10,Stayed here for years prices have gone up and room quality has gone down. Av was leaking in our room on the carpet. Room was extremely hot. Hotel is not nice enough to charge for self parking should be comped for people staying there. Bed were super uncomfortable.
50,Southern most part of the strip cleanliness above average tramway between 3 hotels shows and museum locations between all 3 hotels. Food was great at Diablo restaurant especially the Mexican margarita
40,Nice Hotel! Amenities were accessible. The staff was friendly during our check in. Some of the stores in the hotel were not open. It would be nice to have more restaurants available in the hotel or other activities.
50,Front desk and house keeping staff are awesome. Friendly and approachable. Front desk attendant helped me and provided me all best of offers available and advise me on getting an upgrade to my room which I loved it.
50,GReat stay nice room clean comfortable bed i have no complaints. had a great time and will be back soon! Diablos was very good restraunt the guacamole is so good. very cool hotel Nice and not very expensive so if on a budget i say come to Luxor
10,To have to change rooms twice for our phone not working was so inconvenient. The original request for proximity to elevator was a must after moving elevator was very far for some with a cane to manage.
30,we just needed a room for EDC week and one that was close to our shuttle. so we really needed a place to sleep bathe and eat. The dinning experience was good. but the thing that really soured our trip was that the room was only cleaned after we called a manager about it.
10,My room at the Luxor Hotel and Casino was very disgusting. The ceiling was falling down above the bar/coffee area. There was mold in the shower. The couch had sticky stuff all over it. The casino was dated and very smoky.
30,Everything is extra. No fridge in room. Get pressure sales when walk down the hall to buy face products or time shares. Prices at the convenient stores are insane. Half the restaurants were closed. Bed was so high it was hard to get in. So much water pressure in the shower it almost takes your skin off.
20,Wont ever get a room at the luxor ever again  i usually get comps at cosmo and aria but this weekend they werent available so i had to pay for rooms at luxor rather than get comp room at cosmo so ya enough said
30,Great service but the room had a sewer smell. Staff first tried to resolve by spraying the room with a deodorizer. The next day we woke to a sewer smell so we left the bathroom fan on. Came back later and the smell was overwhelming. The Front Desk Clerk was awesome & moved us to another room. We are very disappointed we had to deal with this issue....something you would expect in a run down hotel not an MGM Resorts hotel.
10,The hotel itself is alright. The biggest problem I had is that not all elevators go to all floors and even if you find one that goes to your floor you might not be able to get to your room from there. This fact is not clearly marked so you'll have to find someone who works there and good luck finding anyone to help!
10,The Luxor is the opposite of luxury accommodations. Most ADA walkways and elevators were broken the entire week of my stay. And when assaulted by another guest management did nothing to rectify the consequences I endured due to this.
50,Stayed at the Luxor many times over the last 5 years and it keeps getting better. Great staff who are always very accommodating. Have updated many of the rooms and they were very comfortable. Many dining options throughout the second floor. Over all a great stay at affordable prices.
50,Great room. Great casino. Service on the floor was pretty good. We has a really good meal at the Public House. The menu was varied enough with lots of items to suit all 4 of us and the portion size was really good. We have the MLife MasterCard so check in was really fast and we also used mobile check in which is really convenient.
10,I’m not much of a complainer but it sucks when you spend 150 dollars for one night have Trouble checking in and still receive nothing I just feel like I could’ve gotten better customer service and a comped meal or my 15 dollar self parking back but I’m not going to hold my breath
50,The food and drinks were great the pool was very nice. The staff is amazing. *Especially the people at the Slushee Bar in the Lobby.* I am very excited to return next year. Thank you so much Luxor!!!!
30,Location room casino was nice. We were there for EDC. For those of you that don’t know what EDC is it’s an overnight festival that starts at 5 PM and ends at 5 AM we put a do not disturb sign on the door because we sleep during the day. The last day of our trip housekeeping entered our room three times. Twice while we were sleeping and we’re woken up by them. The third time was told them we didn’t need service and not to enter and they did anyways. We had no illegal substances or guns in our room. I understand safety protocols after Vegas shooting but three times once where we said no thank you was excessive and off putting. There are no ways to lock the door no hooks or other so they just walked right in. Also the pool music was so loud during the day we could hear it 19 stories up.
50,Had a wonderful experience w/ the Luxor. Clean friendly and outstanding customer service. Food options were fantastic for various price ranges and casino was neat and smoke free. Will be back again!!!
40,The hotel was very nice to us made sure we got in quickly and allowed us to extend our check out time with no problems. I liked how spacey the rooms were but I wish there was a microwave and a mini fridge available.
20,Ac was definitely not working and I called to complain Nothing changed. Also no coffee in room and no room service available at this hotel. Will not stay here again. Especially when I got an upgrade room and couldn't even sleep because of the heat
10,"Terrible and unreliable customer service representatives along with manager  Harrasing security guards with unclear answers to ""check-up"" on you. Defective room amenities such as shower head and air conditioning."
30,A random alarm went off in the middle of the night with no explanation as to why. Very inconvenient stay. Probably will  Not be returning. Never heard of an early alert system and a simple explanation would have sufficed.
30,Property is under staff and the staff that is checking in VIP are very rude inconsiderate especially Roxanna doesn’t know how to treat customers she should be in a different line of work they need to hire staff that is courteous
40,Although showing its age now the Luxor is still a great value option on the strip. The rooms are clean the staff are friendly and theres a few good food options if you dont fancy venturing out onto the strip. We tried the public house diablo's and the buffet and all were good. The waitresses came round regularly in the casino so we were never short of a drink. you can use the walkways or the tram to get to Mandalay bay or the Excalbur. i would happily stay there again
20,I never received a receipt for my stay which I assumed would arrive after I checked out virtually. It proved impossible to get off of MGM’s confusing website and after a long hold I was promised they emailed it to me but it never arrived.
50,We were at the Luxor four nights last week and it was a great experience. Our room was on the 23rd floor. Our room was extra clean. The view was of the desert but it was not clear except for at night because of the covers they have on the windows. We ate at the pyramid cafe two mornings and ate at Diablo’s one night. Both were good. Great service. The casino was ok. There are definitely better ones around. We found the casino to be smokey but they all are. The only bad park is the long walk to your room or to the Uber pick up(depending on where your room is). But again all the hotels are big so I imagine they’re all the same trying to get to your room. Location is far down in the strip so it’s a rather long walk to anywhere. We would stay here again.
50,Room was beautiful and the food was delicious. The staff was exceptionally helpful and welcoming. Large pools with wonderful ambiance added to the experience. Easy access to Mandalay Excalibur and New York New York
50,Loved my stay at Luxor will definitely be back. The staff were amazing! The room was phenomenal and super clean. And checkout was a breeze no waiting in line for me just walked up printed my key and was in! Love love love the Luxor new favorite!
10,We booked the Pyramid King Corner Suite on the Luxor website and when we got to the hotel to check in the room type was not available so our only option was to stay in a Tower Premier Two Queen in the West Tower - not what we wanted. The bed was very uncomfortable and the bedding in our room had pee stains on the sheets very disgusting. This was our first experience at this hotel and it will be our last. Not a good experience!
40,Staffing issues (I suspect) meant some minor issues in room - no water glasses clean but not spotless. Resort fee & parking nearly double advertised room rate. Reasonable total but still feels deceptive. Many food outlets closed out on reduced hours still.
20,The room is my biggest issue. I walked in to see crumbs shrimp and a toothpick flosser on the floor. The bed was scratchy and very uncomfortable like the sheets were not washed. I never saw a single housekeeper have sheets with them or taking sheets out of any hotel rooms and I saw a lot of housekeepers. For all I know they don’t wash bed sheets unless there’s a visible stain. They don’t have a door hanger for the possibility to be left alone and not want housekeeping I came back to a tucked bed that’s why I say for all i know they just tuck the bed back up for the next guest and never wash it. Most Important besides the health of the room was that the shower was very slick. My dad almost fell several times he had to put his heel on the shower drain to get an stability which is very dangerous. I wouldn’t recommend this hotel for comfort but I would recommend it for the use of the cool 39* angle elevator up the side of the pyramid and just the overall coolness of staying in a pyramid. Btw it is the most haunted hotel on the strip I did see shadows of things and hear a little girls voice often.
10,The worst experience ever in any room the sheets were dirty from urine the carpet was still dirty they never vacuumed it the shower had hair in it and still the soap from the last guest was still in the shower the TV didn’t work they sent in housekeeping two times once when we got there and second when we were trying to go to sleep at 11 o’clock at night trying to change our sheets out while we’re trying to sleep switched us to another room that the TV wouldn’t work either all weekend the TV did not work They gave us two pillows for the bed that was it just got to be the most horrible experience ever in all the hotels we stayed in Las Vegas I would never recommend this place
10,The rooms are terrible. No refrigerator. No microwave. No clock. No closet. Batteries on A/C unit and TV remote needed changing. No cups. The room key works half the time in the elevator. Prices for concessions and food are astronomical.
40,Really neat to stay in a pryamid. Room and bathroom are very nice. I really loved the rain shower facet. Pool is large with lots of space for everyone. My husband and I would stay at this hotel again in the future.
50,Overall I had a great experience staying here. It was easy navigating the app and finding our hotel room. The only issue would be that the digital key does not work when trying to go up the elevator. You would have to get a physical card.
50,This was my 7th time staying at Luxor and I will be back many many more times. Every aspect is exceptional. Thank you! I couldn't ask for a better stay a better room or a friendlier staff that always makes Vegas an even better destination.
10,Vehicle was broken into and looted. the elevator of the luxor parking garage was broken. I had to go to the excalibur's parking garage because of my small children. There my car was broken into under a surveillance camera and looted. I didn't get much help from either resort in my distress. On the contrary I was kicked out of the room with my toddlers...never again.
10,I ended up staying here during EDC weekend and spent $270 for a room. The room looked clean but as soon as I laid my head down on the pillow it smelled like throw-up. like not just a faint smell. A strong smell like it was clearly puked on and they put a clean pillow case on to fix it.
10,Worst hotel experience of my life. Advertised as a EDC friendly hotel but wasn’t that at all. As soon as we got back from the event we couldn’t even sleep because there was loud drilling that went on for 5 hours and this happened 2 days so you can only imagine how exhausted we were. The shower doors are poorly designed there’s only one shower door so the water spills out and puddles up on the floor but don’t worry! Luxor provided us with some towels on the shower floor since they didn’t even have a bathroom mat. We tried to look at it in a positive way but it’s so hard to do so when the hotel room is disgustingly dirty and you can’t sleep because of the loud drilling. Luxor also doesn’t have a fridge or a microwave all they provided us with was a ice bucket which is really trashy since we are living in 2022 wtf is that? There was no service at all plus the Wi-Fi didn’t work so my phone was useless. The tv didn’t even work and when we tried to call the front desk we would just get hung up on or it would simply not go through. We would have been better off staying at a motel honestly.
10,The luxor claims to be a nice hotel to stay for edc when it wasnt we had a dirty room comparable to a motel the windows were filthy looking outside the hinges the blinds are connected to had rust allnover itbthe ceilings have bad water damage there was an empty shelf to were a fridge should be so we can store drinks and stuff but we couldnt then after the festival we were woken to drilling in the room above us at 830 am when the festival ends at 530 am why say this is a good hotel to stay for the event when you cant even sleep in after or notify surrounding rooms about the situation
10,The room was nice. Felt this hotel was geared to making you spend money for everything. No drinking water fountains. No fridge in room. No customer service help desk I was told there was a help desk in another hotel. Food and drink very expensive. Be warned travelled to 3 different states the hotels are taking deposits of hundreds of dollars for deposits which was not returned to the card after I returned to the UK. They will not take cash for the deposits and do not give you a print out as queues are ridiculous. Check as money was taken from my friends deposit for a charge she did not make. Woken up by noise of drunken people.
30,Luxor for an average stay is fine. Rooms are okay dont feel bad or take a day to relax as tv programming is awful. Dont bring family on weekend and expect to enjoy the pool. A walk to get to tram. Signage is barely adequate. Nothing special to draw you here. Park mgm for non smokers is a much better choice. Casino floor doesnt smell like ash tray.
20,I paid for late check out and around 12 housekeeping came in and started cleaning throwing away stuff when I came in they had stated they thought I had checked out when In actually I paid for late check out in advance
50,We stayed at Luxor for 5 days over my husband's 50th birthday. We've always stayed at Luxor whenever we've visited Las Vegas. Though it is now an older hotel the service was better than ever! We will definitely be back!
50,Great customer service very professional clean and neat great restaurant options amazing pool very nice room service parking is not that far 200 characters is a lot and i cant think of something else
50,It isn't centrally located but there is a tram that takes you to each of the properties on either side. There is a great Mexican restaurant on the property. Room was clean but we were on the sun side of the hotel so it took longer to cool the room
30,An older hotel on the strip rooms were a good size and decent enough. Pros- friendly staff price. Cons- no safe in the room key reader in the elevator was a nuisance did not always work for physical key and I saw people with digital keys struggle.
20,The check in lady forgot about us. Then after the first night we had a leak in our room and got moved to a smaller room and only got reimbursed for a single night resort fee.I specifically paid for the bigger room and felt like I got screwed out of that experience.
30,Pre pandemic I stayed at luxor and loved it. Naturally when my son and nieces decided to come to celebrate graduation we came back. Upon return I found prices high which could be expected however there was no bang for the buck. I had better food drinks and fun at Fremont experience.
50,Had a really good experience at the Luxor definitely plan on staying at least all the mgm resorts and level up my resorts membership  I love the experience  discounts  next time I will staying at the mirage
40,The Luxor has been around for a while. I've stayed there several times for business and personal travels. It's not the fanciest but it is clean the staff is always helpful they have a couple of great restaurants (Tender Steak House is great) and the location is great.
50,Loved my first Vegas experience being at the Luxor. Friendly clean atmosphere and affordable stay.  We got the room with the corner suite. The tub is a tub there are no jets. A little disappointed but worked out on days where the feet and body were sore lol.
30,I stayed here for EDC week and I can say that it was a bit of a disappointment on the resort fees. If a hotel charges such a thing then at least have a dedicated shuttle to and from the airport. We had to walk or order Ubers to get to the strip. So again if you're charging resort fees at least have dedicated transportation that guests could use. Another thing with the Luxor was slow wi-fi and I have the latest phone.
40,We decided on a room as a last minute idea and it turned out to be a great excursion. There was a couple of odd things but it didn't ruin the adventure. The baggage claim attendants were wonderful however very confusing when it comes to baggage and where to park etc.
50,Birthday and anniversary fun all tied into one amazing trip. Stayed at Luxor and Delano. Everything was great. Good food clean rooms great staff! We will be back like we always are a couple times a year.
20,No microwave or refrigerator in room. Was charged $50 a night for a rollaway bed and not told there was a charge associated. Resort fees and parking an additional $50 per night. Guard directed me to park at Delano. We walked from Delano to Luxor daily. Terrible experience overall. Going back to Vegas in November we won't go near Luxor.
50,First time visiting Vegas and it was a blast. The hotel housekeeping service was outstanding. During a five day stay there my need for towels and room maintenance was quickly addressed. I’ll definitely be back
30,This was my first trip to Vegas with my husband. I really liked it the hotel was nice but the rooms were a little dated. The staff was friendly and kind and the food in the buffet for breakfast was fantastic
40,I liked staying in this hotel for the price. The stay wasn't too bad but we had a small problem with the air conditioner. The room would stay humid throughout the day even though the air conditioner was on. Maintenance came to take a look at the air conditioner but said there was nothing wrong. Not sure why it was warm every single day.
20,The Luxor is a clean hotel. The staff is professional and courteous. The beds are fine. THEY DO NOT PROVIDE IN-ROOM COFFEE!!!!!!  I really enjoy a cup of coffee when I get up in the morning. I look forward to my cup of coffee when I get up in the morning. Did I mention I look forward to a cup of coffee when I get up in the morning? Well I really do. This does not exist at the Luxor. I have to get up get on an elevator and go look for a cup of coffee AND I DON'T LIKE STARBUCKS!!! This really puts a cloud over my morning because I can't brew a quick cup and enjoy my nice clean room at the Luxor. I'm pretty sure that's how it is everywhere here in Vegas BUT I would trade a nice clean Red Roof Inn or even a Motel 6 as long as I could get a cup of coffee. Yes it is that important!
20,The elevator system sucks. The digital key seemed like a great idea but kept giving us problems. And if you are staying on a low floor in the block of floors and don’t press yours first you have to ride it to the last floor pressed before you’re able to press your floor. The rooms are overpriced for what you get and nothing about my stayed wowed me. I paid over $350 for one night and the room didn’t even have a closet or fridge. Won’t be staying here again
40,Overall it was an average stay. The hotel it self is very cool but average service and average rooms. Out of the 4 days we were there our room was cleaned once. Our tv didn’t work and we thought it was odd we had no fridge or microwave. The bathroom was really big which was nice. The beds were comfy
20,Well this is my third visit to this hotel my other two reviews were both 5 stars. Love the service here. Great clean room. Good location on the strip.    Cons: AC not working literally blowing heat. Called front desk to fix issue not resolved. Still too hot to sleep.  Casino got rid of pai gow poker. Love that game. Probably will not return for this reason. We come to Vegas to play that game.  Buffet is not open for dinner brunch only. I used to love this buffet not so much this trip. Lack of food options. Ended up going to Excalibur buffet for the remainder of our trip which was superb.
50,I really enjoyed my stay at The Luxor everything was great from registration at the front desk all the way to the staff at the taxi services area I would definitely recommend for anyone when going to Las Vegas to stay at The Luxor hotel and casino
30,Luxor is not all that you would think ! Lobby was nice but the rooms on the other hand is not what you would’ve thought especially thinking that it’s one of the popular and cheaper places on the strip. Traffic around there to get into parking and out of parking was a mess. Our room smelled and shower wasn’t working. I went to shower and pulled the pin and it just completely came out. Called front desk was on hold for 20 minutes was told they couldn’t do anything about it and they’ll send someone up to fix it nobody ever came. Our shower never got fixed. The cell service was horrible in our room literally had no signal. Paid for a room with a view and got the side on the building with a bunch of equipment and people doing drugs in the alley. Definitely not worth the $1000 I paid.
10,I stayed in a room in the east tower. It had a reservation to check in at 10am but by 11am was still not ready. When I did get into the room it was old and dated. The A/C was loud. The tv remote didn’t work. You can turn it on but cannot change channels. There’s no room service so if you get hungry late you’re gonna have to go out for food. If you want to gamble table games on a Monday morning they only had 3 tables total open; or all games. I ended up going to the MGM.
10,Worst experience of my life. I rented two rooms and both of them had issues. One of them smelt like mold had to get switch to a new room and the other had terrible plumbing issues causing the drains to back up. Such a headache ruined plans i had made waiting on maintenance people
50,The best place to stay on the strip has everything you need and close to everything. When in Vegas the Luxor is life. I must say the place is wonderful staff friendly and I went during EDC weekend as I always do and have a blast. Love your Luxor and see you soon
40,The hotel was great. Checkin was fast when done through the app. Had my room ready within the timeframe provided. Only issues I had was being charged valet parking when I didn’t even drive or have a car. They told me they would look into it and take the charges off temporarily but if they find something I’ll get recharged. Doesn’t make sense at all to be charged something that I never paid for.
10,Long story short I was unable to gamble for 5 days at this hotel and no one who was an employee could resolve this. Ended up going to Cesar’s and gambling there. Wasted time and effort. I came specifically to gamble and could not do this at this hotel due to issues with the MGM ACCOUNT that did not let me load money… I’m shocked no one knew how to fix this and they had no care to fix.
50,Helpful service and clean rooms MGM Rewards Staff was incredibly helpful. Buffet food was good but needs more vegetarian and impossible meat options. Parking was simple enough to navigate. Thank you for the wonderful experience.
10,It's an iconic Las Vegas hotel on the outside but on the inside the feeling is quite different. Room felt like it hasn't been renovated or updated since the hotel was created except for the room next door where construction appeared to start at 7am; always great to wake up to the sound of a power drill. The pool area looked like a rundown mess and the pool itself appeared like it hadn't been cleaned in weeks. I could go on and on but I'll just say if you read this review and still stay at the Luxor you'll regret it.
20,Got bit by a spider in the hotel room while I was sleeping customer service was terrible and your rewards system MGM does not let you use Your points whenever you want to use them. I have stayed there before and I was happier before when I was this time
10,It was terrible. -100/10 stars. The restaurant’s we’re mostly always closed. The food was less than subpar. I would afford better quality food for my dog. The elevators were falling apart. My phone didn’t fit between the bar rails for the elevator and we got trapped multiple times before they told us we were allowed physical and not just digital keys. The staff was friendly for the most part but upon checking out the man at the desk misinformed us and attempted to recharge my card for our prepaid stay! It was less than luxurious and I will never be back. Save your money and go anywhere else that isn’t MGM!
20,I guess you get what you pay for. It’s a little more accommodating financially in comparison to other hotels on the strip. Although advertising mentions updated rooms they falsely advertise and fail to mention ac is ancient. HVAC not clean. Water/mildew stains were found on the ceiling. Felt like a glorified motel. Only positive is bathroom was cleaner than most
40,Clean room 3 Starbucks and a great casino! We enjoyed the sports bar in the hotel as well. Would recommend as a convenient place to stay near Mandalay Bay and all of the available restaurants and other activities
10,The hotel only gives access to your room on your specific floor. There's multiple sides of the building and multiple elevators within each side of the building. You can't go visit your friends in their rooms or explore any of the hotel besides for your room and floor. Terrible hotel to meet up with friends at. Will never stay here again
10,My room got checkout during my stay. I had to spend 2 hours waiting in the line at midnight to got a new room. Also need to grab all my staff from lost and found. Ridiculous experience. Will never choose her again.
40,If you get a Suite be sure to put a roll of toilet paper on the back of the toilet. Every time you turn on the TV the volume is up at 30 when you only need to watch it at 20... and.. the high winds blow through the window and wakes you up!
30,Definitely will be heading back to Vegas but probably won't book the Luxor again. The room I booked wasn't available to me upon arrival so I was placed in a new room. This room had been smoked in one bed was covered in hair and cigarette ashes urine all over the bathroom and juice spilled all over the room (container was sitting next to the t.v.). Luckily the next room they moved me into was super clean. On the plus side customer service throughout was great
40,Staff and check-in was great. We were changed from double queen beds to a king since it was only the 2 of us. When we got to out room the room was stuffy. AC wasn't working as well we wanted it to. Seems as only the Fan worked but room was stuffy and warm. Pool was super nice. Loved that you can order drinks and food from your lawn chair. Although it is faster to get in line and receive your drink/food. They are short staff so its understandable. We went to go watch the Fantasy show. it was pretty cool. My Bf enjoyed it (of course). Above all we had a great relaxing time.
50,Enjoyed the staff and check in&out. I enjoyed my stay! I would have like a microwave for pop corn and some more clothing hangers but staff attitudes was great and hotel room was very nice! Thank you ALL!
50,The mobile check in with an instant digital key was the best check in experience ever. We really enjoyed the amenities and the location on the strip. Easy access to the tram and the monorail made it very convenient for getting around Vegas.
10,Old dirty sketchy  my bed did not even have a fitted sheet over the mattress cover trash everywhere in the halls  The whole place seems extra smoky  Some of the towers literally had been abandoned yet they had us staying in some of the rooms  The showers were a half wall of glass so water went everywhere all over the bathroom floor. Poor design
30,"We visited Vegas about 25 years ago and saw this hotel not long after it was built. It looked magical: a pyramid in a desert city with a shaft of bright light shooting out of the top. We resolved to stay there one day... so here we are staying as a couple for 7 nights.    We booked a Pyramid Queen Room through an agent. It's located at the very southern end of the strip - only Mandalay Bay is further out (they are connected physically). The ""sign"" is 10 minutes' walk away.    First impressions were OK. The checkout desk is huge but only half-staffed. We waited in line about 10 minutes to check in but at busy times there could have been upwards of 50 people in a long line waiting. The staff arrange your room and charge the local taxes and take a bond from your card.    The hotel itself is looking worn. Furnishings are wearing out and some of the walls are peeling. The ""inclinators"" (elevators going at 39deg up the pyramid walls clatter and bang as they go. One of them has missing panels with exposed wiring.    The room itself was comfortable but again some wear & tear in need of a refresh. (I did wonder whether the lack of recent refurbishment meant that it's in line for the replacement on the strip as they do seem to go in cycles).    2 Queen beds were very comfortable. Large flat screen TV which worked but wasn't needed. Bathroom has a medium sized showed and hot water was plentiful and of good pressure (floor 28/30).    The main issue for us was the lack of mini-fridge and coffee-facilities. This is a big negative for a hotel at these costs. To get a drink involves a 10 minute elevator ride to shop bar or Starbucks (where the line is 20mins or more long). There's an ice machine on the floor if you want to try to keep a drink cold with cubes in your sink.    In our 7 days there we had housekeeping 3 times & ended up having to take out our own trash to the bigger bins in the elevator lobby. A/C is a little loud but effective. Our view was excellent looking northwards over the strip.    The Casino gaming floor is exactly the same as all the others on strip. No Egyptian themes there.    Our favourite bar & grill was The Public House sports bar; good selection of beers and burgers etc if a little expensive.    There's an atrium on the floor above the casino with fast food court and another Starbucks that hardly ever opened. The theatre is there - we saw Fantasy which was very good - a glamour dance show. We also went to the Titanic Artifact exhibition - also very good. There's a Mexican cantina there also. Standard mexican fayre.    The pool area is comfortable; towels offered to guests but can be very busy. Cabanas are (a lot) extra; they have TV & fridge. There's a poolside bar & snack bar with on-line ordering & server.    Checkout can be automated but you'd then have to trust that they will refund your bond and charge the correct amount for extras.    So we had a good stay but could be considerably improved with things like a room fridge so as not to have to spend ages getting anything.    I'm glad we stayed ion the pyramid but probably wouldn't return."
40,hotel is a bit dated with very shaky lifts  the room we had was not long updated it was of a good size  There was no fridge in room but asked reception when we booked in and the got one sent right up free of charge  pool due to it being April 1 pool had water in the other we seen was empty due to low season  Location ok it is based away near the bottom of the strip but a bus stop more or less outside buy an $8 24 hour bus ticket or you can walk about 10 mins to the mgm grand get the monorail  all in all enjoyed our stay
50,My family and i enjoyed our stay . Staff were really nice. lots of good places to eat and loved gambling. very nice place to stay and .Very nice location . very clean place rooms and very nice Casino. I will visit again very soon.
30,While there are updates being made to the hotel there are definitely more that need to be done. Paint peeling off the walls in patches AC’s being outdated furniture being “wobbly”. The staff did an okay job on cleaning our rooms desk and bed side tables didn’t get wiped down as there was still evidence from the people who stayed before us as well as trash in the bedside table. The resort did have some higher than normal prices but it could be due to the location “on the strip”.
10,My experience with the hotel is not good. The stay at the hotel was good but I checked out online and I asked them to send me receipt to my email but I haven’t got receipt to my email yet. No one picks up the call. Very disappointed.
50,The service from the moment we checked in to the easy process with checking out the concierge was holding our bags because we had a late flight leaving Vegas the restaurants inside of the Luxor were wonderful great staff overall
10,The bathroom sink drained extremely slow. The terrible shower setup/design allowed the shower water to go all over the bathroom floor.    The AC was messed up and our thermostat wasn’t even controlling our AC unit. It was controlling room 2105 I believe and we were in 14098. Waking up in the middle of the night to find hot air blasting from our unit was beyond terrible. Also the room always felt humid when we came back in the evening.    There was no mini fridge and no microwave. It’s 2022 that should be standard in every room. It was especially inconvenient since a fridge was needed to store medicine. We had to use the nasty ice bucket.    The digital room key struggled to work about 75% of the time.    Lastly Luxor let in so many people to the Sunday pool party that hotel guests couldn’t even go to the pool since the pool patio area was packed all the way to the entry doors. Having the party and letting in people on a day pass is fine but it seriously sucks to pay for a room and not be able to use the pool because there are so many day pass people there. How was there not a capacity limit to make sure your actual guests could use the pool? Also as a license firefighter/EMT the amount of people in the pool area was concerning from an Emergency Services standpoint as well.
50,This is my second time staying at the Luxor. The only issue was room navigation. Besides that I had a great experience. Also I wish they had more restaurant availability. The room and the staff was wonderful.
50,All around awesome experience with the Luxor We ended up buying an extra night. Waiting for drinks while playing can take long but food was delicious and we were still able to get drinks when we wanted them
30,Room quality was poor and bathroom faucet did not work. We were on the first floor with all of the pets and our room smelt musty and Smokey.Cleaning service never cane as well and our bathroom faucet didn’t work
30,We went for my wife’s 21st bday. What better place to go then Vegas for a 21st bday wrong we were overcharged and felt helpless from staff. My wife’s license had to be renewed and we hadn’t gotten her physical card yet. We drove for 7 hrs to get their got checked in the staff checking us in was friendly and made it easy. Well getting stuff from our car I dropped my license our room key and my reward card. We made it from our car to the elevator when I realized I had dropped them I went back to my car and found my room key and rewards card but not my license I told the security in the parking lot and was told to talk to the casino security booth to see if it was turned in and if not to see who was near my car in that short time. When I got to the booth they said it wasn’t checked in and that I was lying no one would tell us they can check the cameras and that most didn’t work. The next day was my wife’s birthday she went to the casino and bar and was told that since she had a paper temp license she needed a wristband from security. Security said she can’t use the paper license because we probably just printed it out our self we had my wife exp license to show that it was just rewarded and was told that since it’s exp they can’t use it. I asked if I could use my concealed license since my license was missing and she called her manger that said I can’t use my concealed but as long as my wife’s paper matched her physical license that she should be fine. That night I went to ask security if my license was turned in after check she said no and asked why I was on the casino floor since I didn’t have my license it’s not allowed. The day we were leaving I seen that the front desk pulled more money off my card I went to the front desk and she printed out my total stay and said that all I was charged I show her my bank statement showing that a lot more was pulled and that their was even a charged less then a hr ago she told me that they would pull more money out they don’t needed it she checked the charges and seen that I was over charged at check in and a random charge for no reason was pulled she said theirs nothing they can do and they should refund it after we leave in about 3-5 days and if not to go back and talk to them.
30,The hotel is quite good and rooms are spacious and clean too. The brunch buffet is quite sumptuous. As a vegetarian I had a few options but was enough for me though would have liked a couple of more options. My daughter missed chicken in the buffet. Suggestion: pls provide drinking water in the rooms if not room service. There is no minibar in the room which is quite weird.
50,This was my first time at the Luxor. Clean place with lots to do. Plenty of places to eat. Lots of shows. Plenty of slot machines. Rooms were spacious. Only thing I didn't like was the fact that the rooms did not have a mini fridge. Other than that it was a great experience. It highly recommend and will definitely return.
50,2nd year we have stayed at the Luxor. Room was nice carpet and furniture looked new. Bed was very comfortable. Slots were pretty tight but we are pretty used to that in Vegas. Only restaurant we tried was Diablos—not impressed with the food or service there.
30,Staff did an ok job checking everyone in during a busy weekend. Bathroom soap dispensers did not work and were not cleaned regularly. Elevators did not work.....variety of restaurants is limited. Would have liked to have seen more variety. EDC costumes were an eye opener for the kids!
50,Room was clean beautiful and spacious. Easy to get around property that’s located on the strip! 3 to 4 pools to choose from even a jacuzzi tub to relax in! I definitely would choose this place again!
10,The shower place place has design flaws. The water was spilled everywhere.  I was charged resort fee of $35/night but there is no refrigerator and coffee machine.  The parking lot is inconvenient too. The room key can be read at exit. I had to call every single time.
10,Want to pay 12 dollars for a hotdog? Want to walk past smouldering cigarettes left on the ground in the hallways? Want far outdated rooms that lack basics such as alarm clocks coffeemakers desks etc? Just feel like punishing your lungs everytime you step outside your room to enjoy 30+ years of smoking? Then this is the place for you!
10,The room 400X was very close to the Mandalay hotel. The location was confusing. The hall way smells so bad. I guess the room I stayed was in the very end corner. I guess all the trashes went there in the corner. No one took care of those white trash bags. No complimentary water in the room. It has nothing in the room. It was very unpleasant experience.
10,Stayed for 4 nights and 2 of those nights they shut off the water between 1-4 am. It was a huge inconvenience trying to sure the restroom no water to flush wash your hands or anything. Huge inconvenience.
30,Ok hotel but dated. The staff was amazing from the front desk housekeeping the Diablo restaurant and the Spa. Get Lorraine to do your massage! The Diablo had good food and margaritas! The Luxor Buffet was okay. Our waiter at the Pyramid Cafe gave us the wrong receipt so I ended up paying for another table’s meal and I didn’t catch it before they closed. The food there was just okay too. Not a horrible stay but I got what I paid for as this hotel didn’t cost as much as other hotels on the Strip.
30,No shower two days room not cleaned or fresh towels for two days. We were comped $150 and 5 days resort fees refunded. Pool water murky a lot of the time. Plastic cups and napkins in water. Not all pools open. Too expensive for pool side food and beverage. Keys stopped working 5 times at least. Spent a lot of wasted time in the lobby queue. Should be a desk for checked in guests Probably wouldn’t stay there again.
30,Ok so this is my first time staying at the Luxor. I loved everything about the uniqueness of the property. You fill like your living in an ant colony. Lol. Location is the beginning of the strip but can take the tram further down. The room we had was half renovated half not. And there used to be a mini fridge in our room where there’s just an huge empty cabinet now. This place could be 5 stars if they renovated all of the rooms. I love the staff everyone is awesome. I love the food. The freshest most delicious food on the strip hands down. And they have an amazing line up of shows and attractions all within walking distance in the center of the building. I would for sure come back but splurge for a more expensive room. Check in is the craziest I’ve ever seen so beware. But the mobile check in process where you get to make your own keys is cool. I truly love this place after one visit they just need to update their rooms.😩😩But the charm of it all is the reason I will be going back.
50,We’ve not been to Vegas in 20 years prior to our stay with Luxor so we can’t speak to how Luxor stacks up to other Vegas resorts but we found Luxor to be a fun and easy to navigate property. We will recommend Luxor to our Vegas bound friends.
20,My stay at the Luxor was underwhelming. For my first time in Vegas I’m upset this was my first hotel/casino experience. It is very over priced for low value. I’d rather pay & have higher quality stay.
40,We were able to hear the music and noise from the lobby any time we were in the room. We did have the ac unit on high to drown it out. The room also was very hot during the day even with the curtain shut and the ac on high.
30,The Luxor Egyptian theme is unique with its pyramid themed main building inclinators (instead of elevators) and decor.    But this hotel badly needs a refresh to update the well worn rooms. The furniture in my room was scratched. The bathroom had a very noisy clunky fan reminiscent of a cheap motel. Overall the bathroom looked like a 1970s style hotel before all the fancy architecture of the past 20 years.    My room was missing the TV remote control when I checked in. I called housekeeping who quickly responded to bring me one; and the gentleman tried it out with me. Either it didn't work or the TV didn't work. He said he would have someone fix it and I told him they could address the issue the next day while I was at my conference. The following evening it was still not working... and it never worked for my 3 nights that I stayed.    The beds were clean but the mattresses had seen better days... very soft in the middle.    I know that the Luxor has two 'towers' adjacent to the pyramid. But the tower rooms while newer are more expensive. I really think the pyramid needs renovation and the rooms refreshed and brought up to modern standards.    I also had to call the hotel once back home to request a receipt. I thought it was pretty bad that I didn't receive a receipt when using the MGM mobile app to check out.    The mobile app in general looks like it was written by some amateurs or really bad offshore programmers. And I am in the software industry so I have just a wee bit of knowledge in this area...!    The one thing that worked well was the Wi-Fi which worked seamlessly across all MGM properties including the MGM Grand Luxor and Mandalay Bay (where my conference was).    The staff were friendly so that was a positive.
50,All the staff was great and made me and my wife feel like we where special. From the time we got there to the time we left there even when it was morning the cleaning staff would great us to the end of the day when everyone else would make sure it was a magical day
10,Grungy feeling hotel rooms smelled like smoke air conditioner couldn’t keep up. Bell person was rude. Pass on this hotel even tho it’s cheap. Only positive thing was the mobile check in and mobile key.
30,The room did not come with no refrigerator or microwave had no towel rack and the air condition makes a loud rattling noise And when you’re in the shower the glass doesn’t come out far enough and the water gets all over the floor
40,Location could be better but that’s just my preference. I like to stay in the middle of the strip and this is towards the end…quite a jaunt to get to other places that you might want to go. Casino was very nice
40,We enjoyed our stay at Luxor.  The staff was friendly. The rooms were nice. The games were fun and the slots were looser than the other casinos we visited during our stay.  The food court is large but if you want to have a sit down dinner we found the selection to be limited.  We ate at Diablo Cantina and the food was okay. Service was friendly and good but the beans were mush and the rice was dry and tasteless. The fish tacos were okay but the meat on my husband's burrito was cold. Steakhouse was pricey and other restaurants were scarce.
40,Visited for a family wedding - everyone else staying here too.  Had an upgrade to a tower room which was lovely - plenty of space huge bed nice view.  Hotel could be brighter interior wise quite dark and jaded. Pool area good casino ok buffet bit over priced but well placed to access the main strip. Could walk to all well known hotels and shops within an hour - monorail available for return if you want.  Remember taxes - about 35 dollars a night per room.  Good value all round.
40,Luxor has always been a favorite hotel of mine since my first stay in 2012. From the Sideways traveling elevators extremely cool decor and the distinctive perfumes pumped into every room. Luxor is a great place to stay if you are trying to experience the strip at more of a bargain price however I did find that it’s lost its lack luster a bit the last couple of years. The perfume is outweighed by heavy cigarette smoke and the floors are stained and dusty.
20,Got a last-minute ticket for a music festival. Thought it was a good deal seeing as I was looking at hotels pretty late in the game. The hotel is pretty dated in comparison to other hotels on the strip. It is a you get what you pay for type of hotel. Do not have high expectations just because it is on the strip and a MGM Property.
50,The process to check in was fast and easy clean room easy check out. Front desk customer service was excellent. Room was nice and clean upon arrival. Early check in was available major plus after driving 10 hours.
50,My stay at Luxor couldn’t been more perfect then what it waswe were treated vip by housekeeping floor managers Sanel Zahirovic and Yesenia Lopez  both went the extra mile to make shure we were treated with excellence and everything in the room was perfect we had the best stay ever! thank you Luxor team we for sure will come back again and also recommend it to all my friends 💯 % thank you !
10,Dirty rooms dirty casino overpriced buffet for what was available harassed everytime walking through casino floor about going to shows from staff. Cleaning ladies leave carts and bags in hallways blocking the hallways.
30,I think for the money it was good. Luxor could definitely use some upgrades. We found the valet luggage service and taxi service to be so convenient. Beds were very comfortable! Amenities said there was supposed to be room service but it was unavailable.
40,4 day Vegas vacation with my son then off to the National parks. Lots of good and not so good at this property so I think I’ll do the list in pros and cons:    Pros:  Reasonable rates for a strip hotel if you stay Sunday to Wednesday.  Join MGM rewards for the best prices and book directly through the hotel. Rates change all the time and they will give you the lowest rate you just have to keep checking.  Rooms were getting remodeled.  Mini fridge in my suite.  Comfortable beds.  Several easy ways to check out besides waiting in line.  Friendly front desk and housekeeping  Comp offered when they screw up (like giving your room away.  Blue man Group on location. (Great show)  You will need to use public transportation and ride share to get around.  Do eat breakfast at the Pyramid cafe.    Cons:  Self check in did not work. (Front desk says it goes Bonky after midnight.)  Fee for parking  Room a/c did not work well.  Extremely overpriced 24/7 shop (use the vending machines on your floor for a much better price for beverages.)  They don’t clean the outside windows anymore (they did it daily 26yrs ago)  Do not eat at the public house.    We had a corner suite and enjoyed our stay overall. Luxor is trying to get it right and is the closest thing to affordable if you want to stay on the strip. I would recommend but for Only Sunday to Wednesday because then the prices skyrocket.
30,Stayed here for business. Bed wasn’t too comfortable and surrounding areas were loud. Overall for what you pay it wasn’t bad. The check in was seamless (digital) and the staff was very friendly. Also very accessible to Mandalay Bay and Delano.
30,I had an overall great experience except during my entire stay our suite was NEVER cleaned. We received fresh towels the 1st day but our linen was never changed our garbages were full and our suite smelled from the old trash. We called guest services twice and on the second day hours later after our call someone came up. We then received new towels and a large garbage bag we had 2 use to collect our trash along with some soap and shampoo. 😕
30,Hotel room was descent. But the tub had hair in it. It made me question was the bathroom ever cleaned. Bathroom was old and they were paint chips where they tried to paint over stains or mold. The rug needed to be vacuum. I tried to to house keeper but I do not believe she understood or did not speak English. She just said she tell supervisor. I tried to call the front desk there was no answer. Plus the lobby front desk always had long lines. Luckily I never use shower and never walked bare foot on carpet. The hotel amenities are great but we never used. Hotel is close to strip and also have access to Tram transportation.
30,Room was clean. Prepaid for parking. Was told room key would get me in/out of parkimg garage. Did not work had to give operator name room number every time to get in/out. Twice operator didn't answer so had to double to get out. Squeaking noise in bathroom at night had to shut door to sleep.
50,Excellent resort and a value to stay! I will definitely be a returning guest! There is so much to do inside the resort and it sits at the end of the Vegas Strip so you can just walk out your door to enjoy the nightlife
30,This hotel could use a new fresh look on the rooms they are still the same from my very first visit and I have been to Vegas several times at different brands. This one has dropped down in my top 5 to 6
10,The staff is friendly and helpful but the rooms are dated and filthy.    The carpet is dirty the furniture is spattered with mystery liquid the showers have heavy mildew mold and calcium deposits.    I strongly suspect the sheets aren’t always changed between guests as I found several pubic hairs in the bed.    I was changed rooms 3 times and had the exact same issues with each.
10,Do your self a favor stay at diferent casino you will be disappointed on every way possible from the arrival parking valet check in the room is just an old dirty casino now days don't satay here dobt satay here dont satay here satay dont here do tsatay here dobt satay here don't satay dont here dont satay here
50,Hotel & Casino was very clean none to very little smoke smell. Beds were great. Housekeeping staff was very friendly and pro9mt .. offered extra towels & pillows as well as any other things she could provide.
40,My wife and I have stayed at the Luxor at least 10 different times. This time we took my 16 year old sons and 21 year old daughter. We went through the Titanic and Bodies exhibit and they loved it. That night we went saw Blue Man Group and loved it! My wife has a service dog and the staff was great with him.  We had a great time as a family. The only things I would like to see is room service back and the pool staying open a little later. Closing at 6pm seems silly. Otherwise a great stay.
10,Room was very out dated no refrigerator microwave or coffee maker. Shower water was cold stay three days and was cold every day. Elevator was horrible it shook worse than turbulence. We actually got stuck once. I won’t stay here again
30,Hotel needs some TLC. Old and not kept well. none of the bars could make expresó martini’s. Air conditioner was loud. Sink would not drain properly. Hotel definitely needs some upgrades. parking structure not monitor very well. Came out to my car where someone had vomited on it. Obviously no security monitoring parking structure.
10,The bed sheets r dirty tv does not work properly parking was bad people was smoking cannabis everywhere it was dark inside the casino elevator was dirty n all stained the room was dirty no shampoo or lotion the second day the sheets r stained
40,I have been to quite a few hotels on the strip. The Luxor is one of the best value hotels I have stayed at. Very reasonably priced with great options for entertainment and food. I would recommend this hotel to Family and Friends without hesitation.
40,Downgraded from suite I reserved but corner suite was still nice loved the soaking tub in the room. Decent service issue with check in and before check out. But won't hold that to not giving fair score.
50,Great place to stay on the quieter end of the strip. We stayed in one of the tower rooms with a view of the strip. Room was clean staff friendly and a great price. You can add a mini fridge for $25 for the length of your stay which we always do for any left over meals or water and snacks we pick up.
20,Customer service was terrible waiting for 16 minutes calling from my room the room bed was really hard. The shower door was missing so water come out and this can be a hazardous the TV remote control was not working properly
50,This was my 2nd time staying there within 5 months.  I like staying there because the front of the house is very nice  The rooms are very very nice.  The pools are full of Excitement with good music.  So thank you.
20,It is obvious that this property hasn’t been updated in 20+ years. Check in is extremely slow then when you reach the check in portion they appear to not care that you have arrived. Dirty hallways and elevators and closed stores - very disappointed.
50,I booked my room last minute for my fraternity district meeting. I was very satisfied with my arrangement. In the very near future I would like to take my family there for a weekend stay and see some of the exhibits.
20,Had a scooter stolen the first night. Staff wouldn't do anything about it. Said it happens in Vegas all the time. No refund and had to rent another one which broke down on the strip the next day! We are seniors and had to walk back to the hotel to get our car to bring broken down scooter back. Told by Scooterbug they had no record of us renting the two scooters. The Luxor itself is dirty outdated old tired and broken down.
50,Birthday get away and had a blast when i was there very quiet and the staff was very friendly. Would stay there again and the experience was great. Wish there was more food places in the food court to choose from overall a great stay
50,Totally enjoyed the stay at the Luxor. I had a wonderful experience. They had great service at check-in and the room was clean. I also used the awesome workout gym which had plenty of workout machines and weights. The SPA at the Luxor was very nice clean and relaxing. Over all I had a great experience at the Luxor and would highly recommend.
30,The amenities are really nice. Lots of fun things to do from the pool to the shows to the Titanic and Bodies exhibit. And of course the casino. The rooms though...you can tell there was some sort of refurbishing as the bathrooms are quite nice but the one we stayed in (in the pyramid not the towers) is still kind of tired and outdated. I scoured the room and couldn't find any USB connectors. The furniture looked like from the 90s. The TV/entertainment system predates HD. I'm confused about how the room quality is incongruent with the rest of the property.
30,It was very basic and not very appealing once inside. The showers weren't that great our air went out in our room making it hot and the wait to get someone on the phone was excessive. Overall I would rate the hotel a 5 out of 10.
50,This is a great place. The Pool is one of my favorite on the strip!!! I love location and love the decor. The theme is so cool when most others feel the same. You know when you’re in the Luxor!! I recommend staying especially during Pool season!!
50,I had a beautiful suite for the price of a regular room I was really happy exited I had a beautiful time during my short stay so many things to do at that hotel don’t need to go far all the fun food and excitement are right there.
50,Enjoyed staying at the Luxor    Check in was nice and easy    The room was a great size in fact was massive I thought and nice touch with the ice machine available outside the rooms    The pool area was really good and nice and clean    Would defo stay here again
30,I can only really comment on the rooms which were adequate my main gripe was that there were no coffee facilities in this room which was a major inconvenience it means you have to buy water and or orange juice to take up to your room at night so you at least have a drink in the morning or race downstairs when you get up to get a coffee at the nearest Starbucks in the hotel. There was only two glasses for water no fridge and the room we were in you could not open a window. The rest of the hotel was fine and the staff were very helpful don’t get sucked into getting free tickets for a show if you book at the hotel as although they don’t mention the word it is a time share scam when you get there. We did this and we’re stuck for two and half hours at this so called knew resort being pressured into purchasing time share which we didn’t of course but I had to get slightly aggressive before they would back off and give us the free tickets we had been promised.
50,The location was perfect for our needs. And staff and inclusions have suffered from Covid (staffing is an issue domestically) - but they still made the extra effort for your satisfaction. What a great experience
20,Reception gave me a hard time combining 2 reservations when another receptionist had assured me i would be okay. Next day it was not okay and i had to get new room keys and wait 20 min for them. Cleaniless was good staff was nice
10,Room smelled like cigarettes! Restroom sink was clogged. Bed sheets & comforter were stained. There was eyelashes in the bed & on top of restroom counter.  Thank goodness we were only in the room for 7 hours. Never again
10,The room was gross stained carpet and stained floor in the bathroom. Elevators broke one night had to use service elevator. Service at all bar areas and restaurants was not good. Staff not friendly no waitresses walking around. Overall not a good experience.
50,Went for my brother's birthday. Had an awesome time. Gambling was great. I hit a jackpot. Luxor staff was great. Rooms were clean and comfortable. Food and atmosphere were great. I can't wait to go back.
20,It was decent but was lacking in basic necessities like outlets working empty vending machines many things being closed very early. Other hotels offer free parking options but you have to pay here. Would choose to stay at another hotel over this one.
30,Quiet accommodating friendly service. Could use some updating and cleaning especially in the bathroom area. Microwave in the room would be nice.  Good selections of entertainment and numbers of stores and restaurants in the hotel. Would recommend bringing your own drink as it is expensive.
50,Love that the Luxor is so close to everything on the Strip. The pool was great our room stayed cold all day. Staff was really friendly and loads of restaurants and stuff to do within the Luxor. We will be back.
40,I’ve stayed at the Luxor couple times now when in Vegas. It’s a great value clean rooms pool is gorgeous. Always have a great time with friends and enjoying our trip. Would stay at the Luxor again and again.
10,I booked a room for one night and arrived at midnight. Once i checked in I got my things ready for a shower i went in to the bathroom and found a hair on the wash clothes! It was already 3:15 am EST for me and i was tired. I ignored the towels and just used the bath towels. When i was done I was going to hang some clothes in the closet and found two men’s shirts hanging up! I called the front desk to complain and they were sending up housekeeping management to check…now it’s going in 4 am EST for me and i was up at 7:30 am the day before. Bc i booked with another co they refuse to comp my room! The taxes and resort fee were more than the room and i was in it for only 12 hrs. The only reason why I stayed here was for a job interview. Never again will i stay at the Luxor!    I forgot to mention that the room was hot it felt like a hot sauna and I couldn't access the A/C to turn it down.
10,Had to wait 5-6 hours for a room…1st room was too hot and bathroom was dirty…2nd room had molded towels and gloves under bathroom sink…Housekeeping was a major bust…Not sure if we would ever go back to be honest!
40,The mobile app didn’t work for elevator and caused us to get off the elevator or ride up and down to get it to work. Very frustrating and caused late arrivals to dinners and shows. Attempted to get keycard line was really long which we gave up on. Wanted to enjoy not stand in line.
40,My bf and I checked in to the Luxor on May 9 and stayed there for a week. The room we got ( a king suite ) was very spacious and even had a gigantic tub overlooking the entire city. I really liked the design of the rooms. Plenty of space for two people. My only complaint is that being on hold with customer service sometimes took 30-45 minutes. It was sometimes easier just to go down to the front desk and wait in line there. Thanks to Steve we got free parking due to my boyfriend being handicapped. The casino area was nice too but very stuffy due to all the smoking
40,Beautiful hotel rooms and the pool was outstanding. Had a few maintenance issues with the room temp but maintenance was quick to respond. The room continued to be muggy on and off throughout the night.
40,I won't complain about anything. I paid $100( $60 room$&others + $40 Resort fee). $100 was relatively cheap in the Strip. I had to understand the resort fee. I used the pool casino and food court.    The room was okay. I stayed on the third floor. I was not able to enjoy the great view of Las Vegas. Probably the higher you are the more beautiful views you have.    In the room I had a dryer shower steam iron and television. But I didn't get a microwave and refrigerator. Even I could get these amenities at Motel 6 in Texas!    The good thing was no roaches. I often saw roaches in a cheap motel in Texas. I didn't see the insects here in Luxor although there were a lot of roaches in ancient Egypt! LOL.    Overall everything was expensive. After I found everything would be ripped off I went to a gas station in front of the hotel in order to buy coffee and water.    Again everything is expensive and ripped off in this sin city please go to Google and find how to save money!
40,Rooms were a little dated but still nice for the price of other hotels. We liked that there was still stuff going on but it was more chill than other areas we visited. Overall felt like a safe area. We would visit again.
50,For the first time my family and I were treated like a superstar in one of the amazing 2 bedrooms suite in Luxor. The 2 bedrooms connected with living room dining room and a beautiful bar. The rooms are spacious and the views are just fantastic. I will highly recommend this 2 bedrooms suite if you are celebrating a special occasion. The atmosphere makes you feel special.
10,This hotel have hidden fees charge me top dollars for these rooms no coffee pot no refrigerator not even a microwave the main service was unsatisfactory because they steam my sheets but did not put clean sheets on my bed so basically I had the same sheets for a week they steame the sheets for bed bugs or what please if you're on a budget do not go to this hotel it's not worth your time your money nothing I will never suggest anyone to go to this hotel it may be a four five star hotel but the service was a one star maid kept coming to the room knocked one time and open the door they have a schedule of the rooms who's checking in who's checking out I was there for 5 days and every day they come in my room while I'm still in the bed I didn't have a sign to put on the door to say (I did not want maid service ) that was not in my room I never will come back to this hotel . Very unhappy unsatisfied with hotel.
30,The rooms are starting to look old and some how dirty. The toilet in the restroom looked dirty. It was not as pleasant as before. Next time we will be trying a different hotel.. we don’t feel is fear to pay for the resort fee when you don’t even feel comfortable using the restroom where you will be using.. or the bed were you will be sleeping.. the carpet in the room seemed it was not as clean to be walking without shoes…
50,Was very impressed with the quality of the facility and look forward to returning again with the entire family. My wife and I were the only two members who visited this time. We loved the spacious layout of the pool area.
30,Room was very average and needed replacement and new facelift. No access to extra pillows or blankets. No refrigerator (option to rent one though). Quality of the bed was not for sleeping well!  Rate of room was good.  Food was plain and damn expensive. $20 hamburgers that were the type and size of Carls Jr's?  Variety of food was limited and expensive.
30,The Luxor is not bad but it is not the most luxurious hotel on the strip. Not center stage of strip but easy to get in and out of. Fun theme good gambling lack of food. But close to other restaurants.
50,My husband and I stayed here and got married the next day everything was awesome except the casino waitresses are rude and their was a loud buzzing in the walls in the morning if your into the paranormal stay here we stayed on floor 13 and there was definitely things that happens there we heard children laughing in our ears knocks on our doors seen several shadows ect but it was super fun and clean and we cant wait to come back for our anniversary
30,Property is nice but dated but still worth it rooms great size and clean (pyramid elite suite) front check in (STEVE) was rude and unprofessional valet people were very rude about us coming in and out of the property and lost our valet ticket which resulted in the hotel charging us 3 times for valet.
10,We stayed for the Egyptian theme because my daughter likes that. Nothing but regret. Rooms are dingy and outdated. Amenities are zero. Asked to get our room cleaned and it never happened. We finally got clean towels after calling and waiting nearly an hour.
50,First time at the Luxor and I had an amazing time.I Enjoyed the Blue Man Group show held there. Pool was very nice and spacious. Casino has a chill vibe and I would definitely recommend this place for anyone on a budget because your definitely getting your money’s worth.
20,Common areas haven’t been cleaned in years seemingly (dust and cobwebs heavily caked on walls throughout the resort). Sticky carpet floors in the hotel rooms for $180 a night. Seemingly no staff on sight when walking around. Won’t return.
10,This was the worse experience ever will never go back or recommend this hotel and casino to anyone straight trash. It made my birthday the worse Birthday experience ever rooms and service was trash never again will I go there.
10,Luxor hotel is old room awful reception staff unhelpful barstaff just plan rude ! Happy hour in lobby bar is 1pm till 3pm when I was over changed fir drinks Lee the barman said he didn't know time not sorry or I will refund you ! Will never return . For a country so hot on service this place really let's you down !
10,Only thing great about this place is the shower pressure. Someone came into our room and staff didn’t care as long as nothing was stolen. But the man with a camera in my room just wasn’t worth checking into… also was charged for parking even though the lot was full had to pay double for valet.
10,There are literally zero redeeming qualities about this hotel. It feels like no one who works at this hotel likes their job and it shows in every interaction with their customers. The rooms - including the suite I stayed in - had so many issues. Lack of outlets toilet paper holders that are actually several feet away from the toilets the fan in the bathroom hanging off the wall a spa employee who used foul language when I asked if she was vaccinated or if I should wear a mask because I'm a cancer patient... the list goes on and on.
30,The bathroom toilet was terrible and needs replaced. Upon flushing throughout the night it Sounds good like An avalanche of water and is quite startling when your sleeping waking everyone in the room. Very little amenities not very accommodating. Mobile checkin / out was the best feature with Luxor. Food and restaurants were sub-par leaving the buffet the best eats at Luxor which is not always the best option for everyone. We did have a good time just wasn’t excellent.  Thank you.
20,Too expensive with NO amenities.. just go somewhere else. To far off the strip no coffee maker or refrigerator in the room and the order in the hall smelled as if it hadn't been clean in some time. Really disappointed for what we paid .. next time I will stay somewhere else.
10,We had to change rooms 3 times wasting our first day. Sink stopped up and overflowing in room 12001. Moved to 12160 that wasn’t clean- bed unmade; towels use. Moved to 16204 shower door didn’t close so floor was always wet. We received no refund for being in a lesser category. We only received comps the last night from Garrick- too late to use for shows.
50,Trust me just stay here it was great location awesome staff helpful hotel action packed it’s an MGM property so you can expect the most from your stay. Restaurants were good we will definitely be back before the summer is over.
30,Although it’s an older property I like it. Be prepared for no modern decor in the rooms. Not a lot of black jack tables open if that’s what you like to play. The environment of the casino is a good vibe!
20,just barely ok.  rooms are forever away from  front desk. mine wasn’t properly cleaned. no services available still!!  wont stay again. could have had a much nicer room for the rate. too bad. i used to like it.
30,Hyper sexualized video screens. No hooks I. The bathroom for towels wash cloth or hand towels. No microwave fridge or coffee pot. Expensive for what you get. Beds were comfortable. Shower was a plus.
50,The experience was nice but did not include a refrigerator with the room was not aware of that definitely needed  That all I had a problem with other than that the room was nice and clean enough the bathroom could of used some updating and cleaning to the door area as well as the shower was weird and you would spill water all over the floor
50,Didn't win any money but had a great couple getaway. Best part of the trip was seeing Carrot Top. I had never had a chance to see Carrot Top before but was well worth it and I will recommend it to all my friends.
10,Due to moisture smell we were not able to sleep properly. When I talked with front desk regarding the door lock issue she talked very rudely and told that she can fix issue after checkout even she was not offering me another room or Bathroom to use.
40,Enjoyed the luxor. It packs extreme value and overall great experiences. Where else in the world can you literally sleep drink gamble and party in a pyramid. Overall value is 8/10 I have stayed before and will stay again .
30,The hotel was very dirty and smelled like cigarettes when i have asthma...The bathroom was nasty! never would use the tub or shower with dirt! Therefore I will never step into this hotel again I spend $250 if I could get my money back I would ..
10,Checked in and the shower room had pubic hair from the previous tenant the bathtub was completely full with dirty water from precious tenant. Finally was able to shower after a room change 8+ hours of waiting..
30,The staff was friendly. The hotel is aging. My room felt stuffy and smelled like smoke. There's no guardrail protecting guests from falling over as you walk through the pyramid room halls several feet high.
50,The room was very quiet clean and comfortable. Check in was easy and the staff was friendly. I enjoyed the restaurants on the property. We had some luck on the slots as well. Overall it was a unique and enjoyable stay. We will visit again!
50,We booked a suite in the hotel although it was in the older part of the hotel still very happy with the decor and cleanliness. The wait in line to get our room on a Sunday afternoon was about 20 minutes. The lady we dealt with was extremely friendly and helpful. I must say every person we encountered was very nice.  Lots of good food options in hotel had breakfast a few times at the pyramid cafe. There was always a line wait was usually 15-20min.  The pool was very chill lots of spots open in early May. One heated pool and one was not.  Would definitely stay again. Not a huge place so easy to get around. Although it is close to the end of the strip it doesnt take long to get to the middle. Excellent value for the money.
20,"We have stayed here before in regular King Tower and King Pyramid rooms. Both were comfortable and enjoyable. We opted for a 1 bedroom suite this time and it was the 2nd worst room we have ever stayed in in Vegas (out of about 100 rooms over the years). I personally have stayed in every type of room in Vegas from extreme luxury suites at Cosmo and Encore to run-of-the-mill regular King rooms at almost every other hotel to tiny dark ""basically a storage closet"" rooms at NYNY and Excalibur. So when I say this is the 2nd worst room I've ever had I'm basing it on years and years of stays.    We could hear ALL of the street noise ALL of our neighbors ALL of the plumbing/AC noises for the floor. The bed felt like we were sleeping on a trampoline. Very bouncy and your butt sinks very low (and we are not heavy people) which makes you feel like you are folded in half while sleeping. It was the two most uncomfortable nights we have ever had in a hotel.    Are the windows single pane? I could hear people TALKING below us. Not screaming. Just talking.    We go to Vegas to relax eat and shop. We usually look forward to a big comfy bed for some ""forget what day it is"" kind of sleep. We are very exhausted after this trip because our sleep quality was atrocious.    Plus our suite still had an adjoining room door so our next door neighbor's smoke (weed and cigarette) wafted into our room freely. People can smoke what they want but adjoining rooms in suites should be illegal. (Yes it was a non-smoking room).    The only benefit of the suite was the modern mini fridge.    Even the safe was oddly placed. I hope you are 6'5"" if you want to see into it easily. Seriously who puts a safe up by the ceiling? Especially in such a huge room that has options. I had to pull furniture over to stand on.    Not worth an extra $200/nt. We used to love this hotel but now it's tainted with this terrible experience.    Just overall ugh."
50,Nice and comfortable rooms were very spacious. Food was great employees very pleasant and helpful! Check in and out was very easy. Very spacious and not to crowded on the casino floor especially since everyone was gambling.
40,We had a nice stay at the Luxor. The rooms are clean and comfortable but could use a refreshing. Diablo's Cantina serves some good Mexican dishes. The casino has all of the gaming and slots we were looking to play. The casino is clean and the servers are there for your beverage needs.
30,This was a trip for my birthday!  Check-in was long & took a while. Signage throughout hotel could be clearer (got lost trying to find the Rideshare area twice) Paid for an upgraded room which was depressing& had a gloomy rooftop view. I asked to switch to a room in the Pyramid which I was told was a downgrade but I liked the view & the feel of the room way better. I wasn’t given a credit or room rate adjustment just basically was told to deal with it. Staff throughout the resort seemed unpleasant & unhappy. So why are we paying resort fees with our stay?
50,Would visit again…great time great place great food! Great weather! I chose the Luxor because of the beautiful architecture. Very beautiful and unique.The diner was nothing short of amazing! I ate there every morning. And the waitress even remembered what I ordered the previous day!
30,The overall experience was good. My mother is handicap. It was a pain going up the barely working elevators. Also it was tough going to second floor to see a show with the sit down motorized chair / scooter she had due to walking issues
30,Needs some repairs. 4a elevator shake really bad. Trash was always outside of rooms. The price for my room I could of stay somewhere else. I stayed there because last time I was there it was nice. But over all it was okay.
50,I’ve stayed at the Luxor a few times and so far is the best hotel I’ve stayed at in Vegas. The pools and the restaurants are great. The buffet is the best I’ve been to. It’s very clean and they have good attractions. Never disappoints
10,If you are planning your destination wedding do not choose this hotel. They do not care about your special day. They do not help with making any sort of dining or travel arrangements. They don't provide a ride from the airport. The rooms are old and run down they don't provide a fridge clock or coffee pot in the room. Overall just a errible experience.
10,The rooms don’t have refrigerators I had to call for one 3 times it never came and yet I was billed for it… long check in lines horrible staff who lacks general knowledge.. called front desk and not once did they know the answer to my questions … one person said refrigerator is a one time $25 fee another said it’s $30 a day …
40,We stayed monday-friday; it was decent for the voucher we had. Disappointing not having a microwave fridge or even a coffee maker in the room but we managed. If you look closely the place is aging but if you're just there to enjoy it's a good time. We felt safe the whole time had good service easy check in and out.
50,It was a great stay! Decent price. The hotel is in the middle of the strip. Service was friendly and helpful. First time staying at the hotel and have no complaints. Definitely will stay here again! Thank you!
50,It was a great stay for the price. Staff was friendly and accommodating. This is the second time I’ve stayed at the Luxor. I wish they still had a poker room but other than that I have no complaints for my stay
10,Better places to stay. Room wasnt nice even after being upgraded. Staff isn’t friendly. Like why stay and gamble there? Plenty of places elsewhere. I was hoping they would try to make it better but they didn’t.
20,If you want to walk back in time to thes 90s this is the place for you! Rooms in the pyramid are DISGUSTING. Furniture was waterlogged and banged up beyond belief surfaces were dirty and greasy the shower door fell off and broke. If you are going to stay here the tower is the place to be. Casino was incredibly smoky compared to Mandalay Bay and surrounding casinos and the buffet is something you should skip all together. The pool was dirty but the cabanas were beautiful well staffed and great service
20,This property is in dire need of a face life and about 10000 tons of bleach. Here’s the thing if you need the absolute cheapest room book it and hold your breath. Otherwise just spend an extra 100 bucks to go anywhere else and you will have a completely different Vegas experience. From the pool to the drinks to the chips and smells it’s not at all worth it. Also think about this.. if that’s the cheapest or one of the cheapest hotels on the strip so that in turn attracts all different kinds of people but mostly lower income. Nothing wrong with that but it brings things into play like people trying to steal (which I saw twice in one weekend) and break into your room and not to mention the overpowering smell of marijuana. Take it with a grain of salt but you can’t go wrong at the Wynn Encore Resorts World and Bellagio.
50,Went for our 10 year anniversary. First time time in Vegas. The Luxor staff made check in very easy. The room was very nice. And quiet and comfortable. Pool was very nice. Plenty of restaurants to choose from.
30,While the hotel had many options our group felt it was a little dated. The gym could be updated and or expanded. The shower in the rooms need to have a longer door. The elevator working with the key card need to be configured.
30,If u enjoy popcorn ceilings busted elevators mediocre buffet and no room service this hotel is for you . My room faced the pool and I was woken up early with music blasting when I really needed to sleep in.
40,Great experience. This was a last minute overnight trip. We got a great rate (way lower than other hotel for this weekend)! The mobile check in allowed us to go straight to the room. It was a great experience. We were able to go straight up get ready and begin our night.
30,Decent trip with comp rooms. Gambling experience was really bad. Machines were not hitting. Old machines. Not a lot of good variety slots. Seems outdated. Needs fridge and microwave in the rooms. Coffee makers
30,The room was not what I expected. The beds were smaller than expected. Towels need to be updated. Other than that my stay was very nice. I like the fact that you can smoke marajuana on the premises. That’s very important since my daughter has a chronic condition.
40,We really enjoyed our stay. So many things to do. Great entertainment all around. Price was good. Good food rooms were nice. Great location. Will defiantly come back one day. Over all it was a good trip.
40,Nice hotel with excellent customer service at every level. Issues with the room were resolved immediately and without hassle. Would definitely stay here again. Buffet was a great value Titanic exhibit was worth the look. Diablos cantina some of the best food I've ever eaten. Pools were meh hot tub was more like a luke warm bath unfortunately.
50,Overall a great experience staying at the Luxar hotel. I felt welcomed and comfortable. The staff were friendly and very informative. Had so many options to eat at . And many more things to do around the area.
10,Check in process took very long one of the people assisting people check in wouldn’t help me and just kept pointing at the kiosk that I couldn’t figure out because she sent me to checkout instead of check in. Did not receive credit for rewards points for my stay or for gambling or purchases made.
10,"We rented two rooms. One we were able to check in online and had to go to the counter for the second. It's a good thing we went to the counter because if you don't - your rooms are not together which I did not see this printed anywhere. At the counter we checked into both rooms and our kids went to the one already checked in - they were in the wrong room. When I went to the helper near the counter she talked so fast I was not able to speak and then was irritated when I didn't stand in the long line to fix the problem right at that moment. Our room stunk like strong chemicals and when we asked about help with gambling we were told ""I can't help you because I work here."" When I went to the counter to cash in my rolled quarters I was told I had to use the machine which takes 10%. Really? Shame on you - I really don't think missing a quarter or two is worth the risk that your customers are unhappy and will not stay at your hotel again."
20,Not all mattresses are created equal. In the past I have slept fine at the Luxor this time though my mattress was so rock hard and uncomfortable that it gave me a migraine. Completely ruined my day today because of pain from the mattress last night. Not worth the gamble for me personally to ever stay there again due to this experience with the mattress!
10,Staff was very rude. Staff was not helpful. The rooms did not have a refrigerator a microwave or a coffee maker. There was one trash can in the room. The showers didn’t drain and the pressure was very poor. The elevators are very sketchy and appear unsafe.
30,Beds were uncomfortable no sense of what rewards can do. Parking was awful . Shows were not as it seemed  need better explanation prior before booking. Holding for room took longer to be released after checking out
20,Fees for late checkouts no discounts on pool umbrellas or cabanas. I stayed midweek and the property was not busy. I could cut them some slack if it was a weekend. You're better off staying at another MGM property or Caesars location.
20,We stayed at the Luxor for 3 nights during the Mother’s Day weekend it was very windy and I will tell you the room we stayed in 9th floor pyramid was NOT GOOD the windows whistled from the wind so loud even earplugs could not stop it I called the desk the night we checked in and they said it’s unfortunately a issue with the design of the building when it’s windy We got NO SLEEP also no coffee maker not even a water glass in the bathroom to brush your teeth or get a drink the room looked like back years ago it had many good features but they had all been removed many elevator issues also during our stay hate to say it but I think looking at the conditions of the rooms hallways ect that this former gem is going to close in the next two years I will never go back One positive the steakhouse in the hotel was very expensive but we had an excellent meal and service
40,Hotel is brilliant if you haven’t been before  really interesting. Check in was fine  room great  some things slightly worn or dated but the bed was very comfortable. No safe or coffee but for the price well worth it. I’m sure there’s more luxurious hotels but this one has character
20,They don’t clean your room well. Eat inside the resort two burgers two fries two shakes. $70.and $9 one slice Pizza. You walk through the casino to get to your car $15 a day parking .Out by the pool no umbrellas. Drunken parties at 1 AM next door.
30,Our room was average. No mini bar or coffee maker. Thermostat was malfunctioning. Staff was friendly and attentive. Pyramid Restaurant was superb for breakfast. Diablo Restaurant was at very best average.
30,Basic nothing special. Far from the strip and any worthwhile activities. The restaurants inside were OK. The room had no coffee pot or fridge or microwave so you buy a 40 dollar meal at the restaurant downstairs only to throw away leftover because there is nowhere to keep it cold or reheat it
50,The staff was friendly and we got to check in hours earlier and got an upgraded room. The room was clean. I just wish it would've had a fridge and microwave. There were 4 pools and 4 spas. Easy access to Mandalay Bay and Excalibur. We also got complimentary tickets to the best show ever Michael Jackson Cirque du soliel.
10,They billed me for untrue statements about the room being wet. Used the bath but never overflowed and they couldn’t show evidence or come up with a good reason to charge me $350 on top of hotel stay. Be careful!! They will over charge and show no mercy
10,Check in app doesn’t work but marketing got all my info. Dirty room walked into wrappers on the floor and empty bottles on the floor. Bathtub dirty as if the area between the tub and was is never cleaned. When endorsing concerns to the manager he tossed his badge on the counter in front of me. Never offering an apology for the experience or any attempt to rectify the situation. The Luxor is the last place you should stay in Vegas.
10,Can't lock your doors  Elevators are dangerous  And rooms are old and dirty lol my pillow had black dye on it  And the room cleaning lady walked in my room when I just got out the shower naked I'm done with this hotel
50,Overall great. Room not very modern. No USBs and no frig. Also no smart TV. Bathroom looks like the only remodel done. Quick check in and out. Also would like to have music at the pool. I don’t recall any music playing.
50,I have been to this hotel many times and it never disappoints.  This is the best deal on the strip hands down.  Went to the Michael Jackson One show and it was well worth seeing. I have seen now Blueman group Carrot top and now the One show. You have see each one at least once.
30,Housekeeping is definitely not the best. Hallways seem to never be vacuumed. Showers are odd with no shower curtains so lots of water ends up on floor if you don't stand right in front of shower handles. Beds were comfortable. No security at or near the hotel elevators leading to guest rooms.
20,The hotel felt old and worn out. Like it didn't survive Covid very well. Some of the elevator cars in the East wing did not work literally you could not push the floor button in. The rooms were not expensive so maybe we got what we paid for.
50,Perfect setup for our 3 day tournament at Mandalay Bay convention center. Clean room convenient location and super friendly staff.    We’ll be coming back for this tournament every year for the next 6 years and would stay here again.
20,I prefer excalibur it's clean staff friendly and resourceful. Luxor just have nice pools and ambience. The wifi is super slow hotel dirty the halls smelled carpet is not leveled properly its starting to come uptrip hazard staff needs more supervision or knowledge of policies.
50,Have stayed at the Luxor twice now and has been a great stay. Many people knock it for being south strip but I enjoyed the tram and how it moves you up the strip or the Mandalay Bay. I try to use different hotels every time I hit Vegas but wouldn’t mind staying here again
10,"Everything about vegas is now ""How money can I bleed from you. Stay away from the strip. They don't even have coffee in your room so you have to buy a $6 cup downstairs. Parking used to be free now cost $10 a day. Everything in the retaurants are 2-3 times more expensive than it should. If you hate money please go to the strip."
50,We stayed at the Lucor for 5 nights and we really enjoyed it I dont think you need to leave the hotel everything is there. Of course we did as it was our first time in Las Vegas.  When we arrived by taxi a short 8 minute drive away the driver informed us that this was one of the smaller hotels on the strip however that was not the impression we got it is huge! There was a long queue for check in and the mobile app wasn't working for us once checked in we bought some drinks from the 24/7 store and headed up to our room.  The elevator was an experience in itself...  Our room was in the pyramid of the hotel and it was very nice 2 large beds immaculate bathroom plenty towels complimentary toiletries and a tv along with brilliant air con which we needed.  We did think it would be noisy but once in our room with the door closed we heard nothing! Slept really well every night.  The pool area is brilliant the pool itself was always cold despite having the sun all day but you soon get used to it there are drinks and food available around the pool and towels are provided. The pools are always manned by life guards and there are always sun beds available.  We aren't big on casinos but when we did go in the staff were friendly and helpful for beginners as we were.  We were advised to sign up for the MGM rewards scheme which we did and Linda was always advising us on offers and what was going on.  We checked out at 11am and we're able to store luggage and still use the facilities which was brilliant.  We will definitely be back to the Luxor it was very much enjoyed by us
40,Egyptian themed hotel! Very close to strip! Tram station within 10-15 minute walk to MGM Grand. Plenty of shows to choose from several restaurants and bars and of course a casino. Three Starbucks on the property for the coffee lovers!
20,Rooms were outdated and dirty. Found previous trash and other miscellaneous stuff from the previous people that stayed in that room. Over all an ok room but would rather stay in a cleaner family’s friendly place.
50,Love our suite. Clean inside and out. Ascetics from the exterior were beautiful. Loved that we were able to walk from hotel to hotel. Shop eat and explore casino's from Mandalay Bay to Excalibur to New York New York.
50,Perfect location for the BTS concert we attended. Also location worked well for all the other attractions and restaurants we went to. It is an older hotel so the rooms could use a little updating but overall experience was excellent. All staff members were pleasant and friendly.
50,Had a great time no complaints. Room was very nice and clean. Also quite quiet. Employee’s were very helpful. Checked in and out with no problem’s. Very clean room and hotel and casino. No complaints.
50,"Loved it! Simple Valet parking....  Easy check in..  Clean room.....  Room service was quick...  No complaints 👍👍  I highly recommend"" Especially if your going to watch a football game or concert at the Alegent Stadium.....  Pool season is awesome....  Room rates are reasonable ....  I cannot wait to return for another stay..."
50,We stayed in Las Vegas for 4 days and between all hotels selected Luxor. It was great! All hotels are nice looking so it is a though competition but Luxor leads the way how it looks like. Pyramid. Never stayed in pyramid hotel before :)  Room very nice and spacious. Bathroom as well. Room service every day. Amenities what you need. Bus in front of hotel. Egyptian theme throughout. Didn’t try swimming pool because of cold weather.  Buffet quite OK. Complaint here is that they close it way too early at 3 PM. I would prefer being open at least until 5 PM.  There are more luxury hotel in Vegas but much more costly.
50,Fun atmosphere. Good location on the strip! Will visit again soon! Close to Allegiant Stadium and easy access to Uber/Lyft. Rooms are clean and restaurants are excellent. Good shows and exhibits. Great games
10,You're better paying more money somewhere else so you can enjoy your Vegas experience! Not spend half the trip back and forth from the front desk getting locked out of your room no matter what every time you leave
40,The staff we encountered during our stay were all very friendly and everyone went out of their way to help our stay to be the best and most comfortable. The casino floor was large with many options to choose from. The restaurants all had very good food. The hotel is very close to the south end of strip and we were able to walk to most of attractions that we wanted to see. The self-parking is very convenient and close to the hotel. It was cool while we were there so we did not use the swimming pools but they looked very clean and there are lifeguards on duty.
50,Everything was fine except the buffet was closed. Nice clean sheets towels and room. Friendly front desk that helped me navigate changing rooms because I booked the pyramid instead of the towels. Rideshare was located at a nice sit down area.
20,Needs updating! Pool area felt like a concrete prison! Not scenic and water was cold.Bottom line hotel was great in the day just needs some TLC. Egyptian theme can stay. Just update!! Elevators are scary! You take your life in your hands when you get on. More than WD! We stayed at this property in 2007 and 2010. Very nice at that time.
40,The Luxor overall was a decent property. However I had major trouble checking-in trying to use a MGM Gift Card to pay my room balance. After waiting 45 minutes to check-in my gift card was denied and I was forced to put my balance on my credit card.
50,We love the Luxor hotel. It’s always clean and the staff are very friendly. Go see the Chris Angel Show it’s the best show in Vegas. We actually rented a car and went exploring off the strip. We might move here.
10,Everything had a cost!! The light and vent combo very noisy!! Room was not cleaned during one our stay.Horrible service overall. Don’t stay there ever!!! You will be ver disappointed and some staff don’t care!
50,Their ADA rooms are excatly that unlike some of the resorts. The beds are low for easy access lots of room for a wheelchair to get around the room and the bars in the bathrooms are positioned well. The shower was also built for easy access. You would think by 2022 most hotel and resorts would have this but sadly they don't. Valet was also professional quick and friendly. The elevator is a little hard to find but once you know where it is you have easy access to the upstairs and Shoppes at Mandalay.
10,"I booked a Suit the air conditioner in the bedroom portion had to be immediately repaired. It never cooled to a comfortable level during the day and at night could not be set on a lower setting for sleeping due to loud grinding noises in the fan motor. The room was overall dirty finding hair in the drain of the garden tub bathroom floor was filthy when a towel was placed on it it came back up with black dirty on it. Empty bottles found behind couch at first arrival. Shower glass leaked while showering and water drained out on to the floor. Water pressure in the room was weak making it hard to shower and take care of daily hygiene needs. Carpeting was raveling near the garden tub. The mattress was so worn that the food of the bed was higher then the rest of the bed causing you to sleep at a reverse incline. All surfaces were either sticky or smudged in the room with dried liquids under the glass. My room gave me a feeling of being very unclean the whole time I was in it. And then there was the elevators which gave you a feeling of dread every time you had to use them. They were very dirty and were in desperate need of repairs/maintenance and upkeep. While checking out the front desk attendant asked how my stay was and when I started to explain things to him he just looked at me and said ""Sorry to hear that"" and handed me my bill. Not to mention he was very unpleasant and rude. The over all Casio was dirty and rundown. I ate at Johnny Rockets in your Hotel and ended up with food poisoning and was sick for a day and a half with severe vomiting and diarrhea. I do have to say your gentleman at you taxi cab stand are very kind and friendly very helpful and personable. I was at your hotel for a bachelor party and your hotel caused a huge issue for me and being able to enjoy fun times with my friends of over 30 years. I know your facility will just overlook my concerns and probably wont read them but I wanted you to know how your hotel negatively impacted my 7th stay in Vegas."
40,I stay in this hotel for at least 10 years I’m always happy with the room ma I get and the price I became a MGM member abs they comp me some nights during the year! I enjoy the pool the spa and the entertainment they got to offer!
50,We had a very good time. Seen some sites and are good food. I will be back to Vegas again for sure.  Next time we are going to try some new sites and places. Food and trips. Not sure when or if more people next time.
50,Great service from check in and the security desk. Very entertaining dealers. Rooms were very nice and clean. Cocktail waitresses were very friendly and prompt. Just an overall great experience and would definitely return!!
50,My room was quiet and I enjoyed the pool! My room was on floor 4. Although the view wasn’t great my room was quiet at all times and I was happy. I enjoyed arriving at the pool early and there were quite attractive women at the pool!
50,Staff was very helpful at check in. Room was great as always. Our only disappointment was at the lack of restaurant choices. Several were closed. Otherwise a very positive experience. Will definitely stay there again.
30,Rooms are average but the worse thing is no microwave. The couple that traveled with us was missing their refrigerator on top of no way to warm any food up so they were unable to refrigerate anything.
40,Comftable beds. Good rooms mostly good views. Elevators need some work. Richard at Pyramid Cafe is an amazing waitor. Highly recommend. Table dealers are helpful to new players. Not one staff member had a bad attitude.
50,I’ve stayed there twice and have enjoyed it both times. Affordable and conveniently located. Rewards program is a bonus for the members. Would recommend this to my family and friends. Will be back for Veterans Day .
10,Don’t stay here. Very unkept and shady environment. Spent most of my five days at other hotels. Restaurant is only open for breakfast. Reserved pool cabana and service was bad. Told that we could come back till 6 so we left and on returning other people were using it.
40,They only cleaned my room 1 day out of 3 the room was very old and there was nothing to make us feel more comfortable refrigerator microwave and coffee maker on other occasions I have had newer rooms
30,Stay away from the staywell rooms and just get a normal room. The air filters are filthy. Staff was all friendly. No real problems other than disappointing cleanliness of the staywell cleaned rooms. 
50,It has been a while since I travelled to Las Vegas but I was invited to a slot tournament and decided it was a good time to go again. I had a great time at the tournament and was also able to enjoy the Pinball Museum bowling and a trip to the Red Rocks Canyon National Park.
30,After traveling all day to get to the resort we stood in line for 45 minutes to check in. The check-in process took an additional 15 minutes. No microwave refrigerator or coffee pot in room coupled with a hard lumpy mattress made our stay miserable. Then    There was a used condom and melted chocolate in the elevator which made me question how often they are cleaned. Can't afford to stay there with children. Average breakfast run $20 each.
50,I checked into the hotel during a busy time of the day. So the lines were long. The front desk staff were ahead of the curve and were very proactive. So I waited no more than 15 minutes which was reasonable. The room was immaculate. I had a great view of the city from my room. I will definitely come back to this hotel!
30,Two mornings in a row woken up before desired. First morning emergency alarm going on for approximately 15 minutes. Second morning wake up call by maid service. I would have given 4 stars otherwise for stay
50,The guest room was nice and they provided me with the exact room that I had requested. I was expecting that there would be no room available in what I wanted. The staff went above and beyond to make sure my stay was perfect!
50,I used to hate the Luxor. I stayed once years ago and since then tried to steer clear of booking with them because I hated the old outdated rooms. They gave a cheap and cheesy vibe but I recently swallowed the bullet to give them another shot and was very surprised to see things had been updated! Everything was great from the mobile checking and checkout process to the beautiful room! It has definitely gone from my least favorite resort to my favorite! If you've had a bad experience in the past with them then I highly suggest giving them another chance because I don't regret it one bit! I cannot wait to go back and I will be staying at the Luxor!
50,Beautiful hotel and a great stay for me. Easy checking and check out process. All the staff was friendly and helpful!! Great distance to attractions and other hotels. The room was very clean and had plenty of space. The deli located downstairs in the casino had very good food and the staff was very friendly. I would suggest a stay at Luxor for anyone who want to get their money worth in Vegas.
40,Great place to stay in Vegas. The front staff is phenomenal they helped us check in early. They gave us an upgrade and we’re extremely accommodating. The staff at the blackjack tables are extremely helpful and had a great time playing with them even though at times we lost some money. Lol. The pools were clean and enjoyed the music and bar service. Recommend staying here.
50,This was my first time to Vegas and the Luxor made first time experience amazing with a complimentary upgrade to my room after I had a horrible experience with the airline commute and the amenities available and customer service were top notch. This was a hell of a first time trip!
20,My husband and I have stayed here a couple times. Each time a different situation but this last time took them off our list of return stay. The room was supposed to be a complimentary upgrade however when we got to our room and looked it over we discovered that while we did get a wet bar we also didn’t have a shower that is ideal for moving around. The shower was designed for a person in a wheelchair that needed a bench to sit on and no spare room. Yes the bench was nice however the shower head wouldn’t stay up on the bar for you to shower properly the floor wasn’t designed for the water to gather at the drain so by the end of the shower the entire bathroom floor would be wet and the shower stall was extremely small. We went and told the front desk and they said that all showers are the same size (that was a complete lie because we had stayed before and had a normal size shower) and they said that if we wanted to move rooms that it would be an extra $40 a night. What is also disappointing is that if there was a person that needed the wheelchair accessible room they then wouldn’t get it because they placed to adults in a room that should have been reserved for special use only.
40,We stayed at Luxor for about a week first half was in a “2 bedroom suite” which was not really accurate we were in a room that was next to the actual suite. All in all not a bad value if you are on a budget
30,If you are looking to save money while staying on the strip this is my choice. But be aware of the smoke smell through out entire hotel (including rooms from ventilation) as well as scary old elevators.
40,Room was clean. Staff was friendly. Pool staff was great. If you want affordable and good location I recommend Luxor. The parking lot always smells like pot but the hotel can't really control that I think that's now common in Vegas
50,Had so much to do within the hotel itself but is very close to the strip if u want to wonder somewhere else we had a blast staying here. The fantasy show was amazing and fun! And the titanic exhibit was very interesting! Overall my favorite hotel stay in Vegas to date hope to be back soon highly recommend luxor! Oh cant forget the beautiful pool !
10,The Luxor is an older hotel and needs maintenance. The carpet is buckling causing me to trip several times. The water shut off in the hotel for at least 2 minutes while I was in the shower. The air conditioning was not working in the hotel or my room. It kept cutting on and off making very loud noises all through the night. The pool was freezing! It was like sitting in ice water. Tried to get in the hot tub and it was roped off. Pool staff told us they had other hot tubs but we couldn’t locate them. Everyone we asked seemed just as confused and lost as we were.
40,Until now I enjoyed staying and playing at Luxor Las Vegas. But now the Wheel of Fortune 25cent machines are gone so I have to go to the downtown casinos to play. It would be nice to have the all day room service back too.
50,I enjoyed my stay at Luxor Hotel and Casino. My room was clean and nice. The customer service was great. I would stay here again. There’s plenty to do here so there was a day I did not have to leave the property.
10,"Even with the sale prices for the room this stay was overpriced. I was given a room with dirty sheets a ""wet bar"" of packets of coffee and disposable cups a non-working TV and old alcohol bottles left from previous guests. When I informed the housekeeping staff they made up the bed didn't change the sheets. I had to ask for them to come back a second time just to get clean sheets. They never removed the old bottles during my stay. When I notified the front desk of the problems with the room they told me that they couldn't offer me another room because there were no suites available. I would have taken any clean room. I was informed that it wasn't an option. Please don't bother find another hotel. It might be more expensive but it will be worth it."
40,I love the resort for its maximum value and cleanliness. They have great restaurants and entertainment too. The location is nice because it’s not part of the cluttered side of the strip. I always stay here at the Luxor
30,It's time to renovate the property. Nice hotel but very outdated. Having one elevator for an entire floor was not a good idea. The room had water leaking from the ceiling during the night and I had no idea where it was coming from.
50,We really enjoyed our stay. No issues just fun and easy. All the employees were friendly and quick to respond. Room was big and had a pool view. Elevators were slow but that kinda happens during the busy parts of the day.
20,The rooms where not as expected until we received the room we booked in the pyramid which should have been done from the beginning. We had to be moved 3 times to 3 different rooms to finally get a decent room to spend our vacation in smh
50,Everything was perfect besides my deposit not being returned yet I am on the road left everything the way I found it I have pictures for proof if needed I just need my money back that's entitled to me it's my way home.
10,Room and inside the casino were not appropriate for kids/ elderly or nonsmoking people. Outdated amenities and old room. Dirty carpets and horrible AC.You smell smoke and burnt food as soon as you leave your room. There is no clean air inside the Casino!
10,Don't waste your money this place is such a dive. When booking the trip I thought how much time are going to actually spend in the room anyway... and not much. But o would definitely have rather stayed in an armpit than this place. No fridge in the room to store your hangover water or beer snacks etc. But there's a empty cupboard where one should be (we did check w front desk it's that way in all the rooms). All of the outlets are so loose nothing stays plugged in. Like every single outlet. Maybe that's because the buildings sinking and it's throwing things off not sure. The showers make absolutely zero sense. There's no door just a single pane of glass which looks a little fancy at first then you realize it's impossible to turn the shower on or off without drenching yourself and there's nothing to prevent the water from spilling out of the shower except for your body. So water everywhere all over the floor the counters things on the counters everywhere. Walking down the hallways everything is visually dirty or dated and falling apart. One last addition to date this casino: Popcorn ceilings.
40,The Luxor staff was great when dealing with them face to face. We did mobile check in and it was fairly easy through the MGM app. The room was a good size for it being a suite. It had two air conditioning units a couch and the bed was comfortable but the room had a few things wrong with it. The bed sheets had stains on them and the tub wouldn’t drain so we weren’t able to use it more then once. We weren’t able to get this issue resolved because we were on hold for about 9 minutes and my husband said to just hang up and forget about it because we were only staying for the night. So just be prepared to hold longer then ten minutes to speak to a front desk agent if you have issues in your room.
50,I've always wanted to stay at the Luxor. Since it was built. I had a great time and experience at this hotel. Staff was very friendly helpful and pleasant during my time here. I'm looking forward to my next stay.
30,I booked the suite and the tub/jacuzzi was full of hairs and the AC wasn't working well I didn't stay much in the room so it worked out but either than that it was alright. I would think about staying here
40,Overall good experience. Disliked the fact that you have to use a keycard on the elevators but I guess that’s for safety reasons so I can’t be too mad. Also had to switch rooms because nothing electrical worked but then the second room the sink was stopped up. Slight hassle to speak to someone via phone at the front desk. Minus those hiccups everything else was fine. The vibes at the pool were nice pricing a little high but expected. Enjoyed my first stay at the Luxor!
10,Worst stay we’ve had. From super long checkin lines to rooms that were just vacated and not even touched for cleaning bugs in the room and absolutely a lack of customer service to remedy the issues. So dissatisfied
50,Great trip although is was a short stay I had 2 reviews. First my digital room key stopped working after the first day. I was quickly helped to get a physical key card. But no answer why my digital stopped working. Also housekeeping did not stop by. Called to request and was assured it would be taking care of immediately. Came back to the room later that night realized it was not. Did not attempt another call. All aside the visit was great.
50,Everything was very clean and the buffet was great. All the employees were very pleasant. Casino is great and the bartenders are friendly. Located in a great spot on the strip with easy access to Mandalay bay I always enjoy this place. The atmosphere can be a little more laid back than other casinos. The interior is very wide open and I think that helps make it appear a little more calm which I like.
30,How can the resort fee be more expensive than the room itself. Mgm resorts make sure to make up what they are making on the rooms by the ridiculous minimums at the tables. Add in the $15 per night parking its a shame Mgm Resorts are struggling so much they have to get every penny they can.
50,Best time ever even thought it was my first time I really enjoyed it and I am definitely going back to Luxor and recommend it to my friends. It was close to the t mobile arena and to the strip and the food was great
20,VIP service sucks and if you don’t have it; be ready to do a lot of waiting and the walk from rooms to parking to getting around is too far if you have walking issues. Desk workers give conflicting info!
20,This location is affordable but there is not any dedicated service to MGM members through VIP desks or on-site hosts. There is also no non smoking and the cleanliness of the casino was sub par. I have stayed at MGM Grand and would recommend that location and skipping Luxor or Excalibur.
50,My friends and I were on a 10 day motorcycle trip and staying at the Luxor was towards the end of that trip. We all had such a great time really enjoyed our stay and all the amenities the resort offered. 5 of our friends were from Brazil and had never been to Las Vegas before so they were all exceptionally impressed with the professionalism from start to finish.
30,Staff was great. Beds all sloped to inside. Halls were very dirty never mopped or vacuumed. First room smelled of marijuana so badly we had to relocate. Slots were extremely tight and there was no Three Card Poker. Food at Public House was sub par. Nachos made us both sick. Tea is $4.50 which is absolutely too much. It's not even in line with Bidenflation.
10,Not happy here this choice of hotel was not what is advertised. We did not travel with children the experience has made us all decide we would not visit and stay at the Luxor again. Room 16025 stayed cold  we had 2 queen rooms and 1 king…… so unsatisfied with the staff…. Baggage area front desk on the phone with the concierge hung up on it took 4 calls.
20,Was expecting a more decent room for 3-star ratings. Overall hotel is outdated lighting in room was very dim no water pressure in shower there was water staining on ceiling and to top it off I was charged $200 more than agreed thru hotel site. Also walls are thin you can hear ppl and water going down pipes.  Check-in and check-out can be done thru app which was extremely helpful and didn’t have to wait at front desk because the line was long if you decide to do it all online choose print cards and go to the front to get them because the online card does not work.
40,There are so many fun things to do at the Luxor! It didn’t matter that the parking was a long walk we didn’t have to drive anywhere. We saw Blue Man group had a great dinner at Diablo’s Cantina and enjoyed the breakfast buffet! The room was comfy and nice. A bummer that they only had Pepsi products.
10,Don’t stay here. Room was smelly and dirty. Talked to staff and they told me to upgrade again. I already paid double the price of the standard room. Stayed in towers west. Location also sucks. I would run from this place.
30,The Luxor was an average hotel generally nothing went wrong however the wobbly railings on the hotel floors were sketchy and the rooms didn't have any amenities which we would be used to when staying in a hotel with resort fees. (no refrigerator or coffee maker). Very unique to stay in a Pyramid and the food at both the Pyramid Cafe and the Buffet were great.  AVOID NATHAN'S in the food court. Horrible food at insane prices.
50,The East Tower at the Luxor is very spacious and updated. The room was maintained very well and the House Keeping staff made sure my stay was awesome! Definitely would recommend staying here! There are great food locations as well!
50,My partner and I got married on 05/07/2022. Luxor Hotel was the greatest place to celebrate my marriage. Staff was so professional and organized in every way. The gaming areas are the greatest very clean.
40,My boyfriend and I got sick from eating at Nathan’s there to the point he was hospitalized. I would eat outside the hotel. Other than that not a bad stay at all staff hands down very friendly and helpful.
30,If you need a cheap place to sleep and don't need extra comforts this works. VERY basic and it's a long walk from lobby. However breakfast at the cafe was very good and the Bodies Exhibition made the overnight stay worth it!!
10,Air conditioning didn’t work in 2 rooms. The third time we swapped to a tower room it worked sufficiently enough that we didn’t sweat in our sleep. We kept drapes drawn and tried to take cool showers to avoid heating the already hot rooms any more. I didn’t know I could sweat while showering or be hot after getting out of the shower. Also in the pyramid rooms there is no shower door at the rear of the shower where water obviously splashes so the whole floor gets soaked and is a fall risk for anyone or any age.
50,The front desk was very friendly and helpful. The remodeled rooms are excellent. I is quite and upgrade over the way they used to be. I am impressed with the quality of the tower rooms. It is very much improved.
40,I was looking for the cheapest hotel at a central location and this was it. It was awesome! You get to live in a giant pyramid surrounded by a sphinx an obelisk hieroglyphics and gigantic Egyptian statues. There was even a 24/7 convenience store on site.
50,I love this place hope the property never changes a dinner buffet would be cool though even though the rewards program has changed and you don't get much for gambling there compared to other places I gamble
50,t was my mother's 71st birthday and she had not been to Vegas for over 20 years. It was on her bucket list to do as she is struggling with a health crisis. We loved the experience and the staff was amazing!
40,Casino looked good. Amazing Steakhouse restaurant. However the hotel itself could use a little attention. Walls and rooms are looking a little worn. In my opinion updating paint and lighting would help update the overall look of the hotel.
30,Hotel was located near the location i needed to be. Few issues i had here was the cake dust behind the bed as well as the air quality in the room. I have bad allergies so the dust with bad air quality plugged up my nose. I had to breathe through my mouth when asleep. In turn sore throat coughing. ended up with sinus issues still 3 days after my stay.
20,The Luxor has a ton of potential if they would just do a few upgrades. The ceilings were filthy black with dust bunnies and cobwebs all over them. So gross. No mini fridge microwave or coffee maker in the room which is crazy because that is one of the most BASIC amenities for a hotel. Another BASIC amenity at a Vegas hotel is free valet service. We paid $30 for 1 night valet and my truck wasn't even kept in a parking garage just a small open lot next to the street. The customer service upon check in was great other than that the Luxor was just OK. Nothing spectacular. which is disappointing because the Luxor used to be THE PLACE to stay.
10,Overall beyond disappointed  AC filter was dirty and moldy  Bath tub would flood  Alarm went off at night and no explanation was given.  No fridge in the room and no warning to let us know  Loud noise and vibration when water would run  Staff was rude all throughout the hotel.
40,The atmosphere within the Luxor is incredible and enhances the overall Vegas experience. The restaurants in the hotel served us some of the best food we’ve ever had compared to previous stays at different hotels. If you’re looking for a great Vegas experience for exceptional value I would definitely recommend the Luxor!
30,Everything went well other then the original room we got booked to was dirty. We did get transferred to a clean room with a fridge. The luxor is nice and has 1 bar that is open 24hour. All in all stay was average
40,Was my daughter's 21st Birthday and for a present not only did she have a great week and was actually able to sit at a slot machine but also had her $250.00 suit case destroyed. other than that it was a experience that she will never forget.......
50,This was our first trip to Las Vegas. I chose the Luxor primarily because of it proximity to the House of Blues and the price. It's a bit overwhelming when you walk into the lobby and grand doesn't seem large enough of a word. But it's got a great vibe and you feel comfortable. We were welcomed by the friendliest staff at every turn from check in dining and even the pool and spa days. We visited other hotels on the Strip but figured out pretty quickly that we're Luxor people now. See you next time Luxor!
50,We were weary staying here at first because we heard all the stories of it being old outdated run down rooms and not to mention it’s at the end of the strip. However after staying here for 5 nights we were blown away. The room was newly renovated and smelled great. Many casino games and food choices. The pool is one of the best we’ve used on the strip. The staff is very friendly and helpful. Also very good rates. Get the MGM Rewards card and use it often. You will get comped rooms
50,Stayed in the pyramid rooms. Seemed updated with new bathrooms and comfortable beds. Shower was amazing. Room felt very clean. Had a preconceived notion that Luxor was starting to show its age from walking through previous trips but was very pleasantly surprised. Would stay here again without hesitation and I am a picky traveler. Everything was perfect for our trip.
10,First off the elevators are horrible and feels likes you will get stuck which I witnessed a couple get stuck in elevator #16. The 39 degree angle it takes makes you feel like you fall over. The rooms are super outdated no fridge in room air conditioner controls were broken and unable to finely adjust temperature setting the bathroom has half shower door so when you shower water gets all over the bathroom floor. The parking is so large that if it's full it's a very long walk to the hotel. And there are only 2 locations for the elevator which makes you walk very very far to your room. Actually the way everything is placed it's a far walk to anything like the food court parking pool and spa. There were hardly any workers in the 24/7 market which forms a long line if it gets busy.
40,While we weren't all thhat high up our view was decent with some privacy from the building bridge blocking just enough. The room is masculine with tall ceilings and dark decor that we found very cozy.
10,The rooms and hotel smelled of sewage. The beds seemed rock hard. The ac hardly worked and had a bunch of allergens. The keys to rooms hardly worked. Elevators didn’t work. People at the front desk are not there to help or ask questions not friendly. Rooms don’t have coffee pots nor a fridge. Water pressure was horrible not clean at all.
40,Nice clean hotel and easy to navigate. Seems like dealers were not as fun and engaging at the craps table as they were on our last trip back in March of this year. Table limits are also higher so the casual gambler is probably not as likely to play. We like a lower table limit that we can start off with and bet more as we go along. Also only one craps table was open during our Tuesday thru Friday trip alt all the MGM properties we like to play at while in town. So sometimes we had to wait or go somewhere else to play. Would have been nice to have a $10 table open in addition to the $15 table.
50,First time in vegas and definitely will not be the last. Visiting with family and friends we arrived at the hotel and was amazing how it looked. We had a great time and hotel staff was very helpful and friendly. We will definitely be returning to vegas.
10,Even they have rats and cockroaches Disgusting employees with bad attitude some of them in the casino the most I will not recommend this place go away go to different casino or hotel but not this one suck service and their room are not clean like they saying not even a good tv
50,My wife and I stayed at the Luxor for two nights. The room was recently remodeled. Very comfy beds many channels on the TV fast internet fun casino and nice pool complex.    The only problem with the Luxor is the location (Lots of walking). Very friendly staff. I will return soon. I added many photos of our visit.
10,At check in I was told that my room wasn’t available as they were sold out. This wouldn’t be an issue if they would’ve tried to make it right. No! Instead the lady at the front desk stuck us in the back in a downgraded room and on a low level. They didn’t even offer me an upgrade a casino voucher or a discount of any kind. They didn’t do anything to correct my issue. A total level of carelessness by staff. Will not stay here again may not even stay at ANY MGM property again.
30,The location was excellent since we were in town for a tournament at the convention center next door and we had to stay at Luxor. It all connects so we didn’t even have to go outdoors to get there. We had upgraded to stay in the tower and the room was comfortable and seemed clean. Check in and check out was simple with the app. I was thankful because there were huge lines to check in and especially check out down at the registration desk. The app is a must. Parking wasn’t ideal because I had to park uncovered. There are only 2 levels — one covered level (which was full) and one outdoors. It’s $15/day and you can drive in and out of any MGM property parking lots with it. My only real complaint was that I saw a roach on the floor near the elevator in the tower. Eww. Thank God the room seemed clean.
50,Great place to stay. Tons of good food and entertainment options at the Luxor! Affordable clean and nice room options. The employees were very helpful and they gave us great recommendations on places to go to. Check-in was quick and easy through the app.
40,The check in process was fast with the self check in app. The room was clean with a comfortable bed. Wish they had a coffee pot in the room. The pool area is nice. Only problem was parking i paid when I checked in but the gate would not open I had to pay again to get out. FRUSTRATING.
40,Good overall experience. The hotel was fairly clean. The elevators was an experience by it self. I asked for more towels and it took 5 min for them send them over to our room. Good connectivity and plenty of things to do within the area. Good location
50,Had a fantastic time staying at the Luxor it’s everything you would expect when staying in Vegas with tons to do inside and out I will say the best breakfast the whole stay was at the little Café inside the Luxor but you have to catch them pretty early because they’re only open in the mornings but overall I Highly recommend!
10,Water from sink and shower gets clogged there is not a fridge and they don’t even provide a complimentary water bottle like all others hotels do. I know it’s cheap but not even like that it’s worth it’s money.
50,The resort is well kept. The rooms are clean and modern. The staff is very helpful and the pool is really relaxing. The food was very good and we used about every restaurant. Saw the AGT show and it was fantastic. I would definitely stay here again.
20,Go to Excalibur instead. Elevator panels missing phone keys are worthless. Elevator feels like ridding a horse it is so shaky. Ac doesn't cool the room. Toilet paper is too far from the toilet. Place smells musty but the bed is comfortable
30,Price for a tower suite king was good via a MGM rewards discount but room needs some updating. Broken tiles in bathroom tarnished fixtures stains in carpet and sofa worn furniture are just some of the issues. Property seems to be positioned in the MGM portfolio as a value property while not being a great value anywhere else on the resort. Dirty towel on floor and poorly vacuumed floor also was an issue. Room is spacious and could be very nice but at this point the rooms at the Luxor has an almost motel-esque vibe. But I guess it was a good value.
50,Nice place to stay for the value. Hotel is set up very nicely and all inclusive. Staff was very nice when we asked for services or extra towels and blankets.  Staff handled a security problem for us with professionalism.
50,Booked online having looked at the different room options we chose a Pyramid corner king suite. Arrived after a short journey from the airport. We booked in at the desk not a queue at 4 in the afternoon. Went up in the diagonal elevator to our 6th floor suite. Room was clean and smelt fine - some other Vegas resorts we have stayed in have smelt of smoke or weed. Did find an unusual piece of rubbish in one of the bedside drawers but no great deal to just drop it in the bin.    Room was big with the bathroom to the right as you walked in - the shower does have a short glass door but use the bath mat and it catches the water that might spill out. Then past a wardrobe and safe with the bed straight in front of that. A big clover shaped bath tub looking out over the strip and then round the corner a seating area with another TV and a fridge air conditioning was good in both areas. Had an issue that the safe did not work but it was soon mended after we reported it at the main desk.    Room was made up with plenty of towels toiletries and left clean. Maids were very friendly when we spoke to them. Couldn’t really fault the room - plenty of storage for clothes and hanging space too. Very quiet close to the lifts and we only had to wait once for a lift but one of the housekeeping guys showed us a shortcut.    I would go back here again. If you have an issue with your room speak to someone at the main desk as we found things were sorted out quickly!
50,Great place to stay. I have been staying at Luxor for over twenty year and continue to enjoy it every time. Staff is always nice and the location in convenient to getting around the strip. I will return soon.
50,Stayed for a week visiting from the UK and we had a great stay! We stayed in the West Tower room and it was huge very clean and nice view! The Pool was amazing always lots of sunbeds anytime of day and can order nice food and drinks with servers walking around. Also it’s at the start of the strip but don’t let that put you off it’s so easy to get around and nice to explore more definitely recommend. We loved it!
50,Short 4 night stay with daughter.  We always stay at the Luxor. There are lots of things to do. We love the pool area. Nice to go and relax at the Spa. A wide assortment of restaurants and bars. A nice assortment of shows. Carrot Top and The Blueman Group are excellent shows. The staff are very helpful and pleasant.
40,The room was great the reason four stars and not five was a refrigerator would have been fantastic to have in the room to (at no charge!) The staff was awesome and friendly whenever we chatted with them and at check in too!!
40,Cool casino in between a couple others. Decent amount of shops and restaurants. The body exhibit is really cool. titanic was slightly boring. Ubers are pretty easy to catch from there. The room was updated but no fridge. Staff was friendly. Party time in the hallway but to be expected.
50,This was my first time in vagas and I loved it. This hotel was excellent and had a lot of things to do and a lot of places to eat. This hotel is located where you can reach the rest of the hotels making it easy to get around.
40,Just a few minor issues with hotel room. Musty smell and no mini fridge to keep items cold. Elevator wait times can be long so beware. A tram station is near by to get you from Luxor to other casinos wit ease.
50,Would definitely come back and get the same room. I think I’m coming back in 3 months it’s my friends birthday and we need a 4 day stay at the Luxor. In the past 2 years all my visits to vegas I’ve stayed at the Luxor because it my favorite casino
30,1. A/c was loud and clunky  2. Dust on fan vent in bathroom looks like it has not been cleaned since pre covid.  3. Key on phone is a pain get a physical key.  4. Half a shower door. Be ready for the floor to get nice and wet. Makes no sense to have half a door.
50,I found Hotel to be very Clean ! Staff Extremely friendly and helpful ! I also wanted to mention I have Extremely bad vision because of eye disease and all the shows I went to put in front Row seats very willing to help !  Overall .I had an amazing time and definitely will make the Luxor my first choice of hotels in vegas
50,Our stay at Luxor was great. Easy check in with App. First day was hard to navigate were things were but after that it was easy. Food was good in the Pyramid Cafe. Lots of choices in food court area. Uber location easy
50,Delightful! The proximity to the airport is perfect. Upon arrival you are transported back into Egypt itself. The architecture is fabulous as you enter the main lobby. It is a WOW experience. The Pyramid interior takes your breath away immediately. Awesome. Check-in fast and efficient. Room given on 22nd fl. overlooking front of building and airport was great. Beds super comfortable room very clean with little amenities and plenty of towels. Very quiet room easy access to elevators with room key access to upper floors very safe.  Upon check-out in morning long line had formed. Just wanted receipt so decided to just ask at the Bell desk to please retrieve. Liz extremely helpful and kind informed me she would give front desk my email to send. Relieved so we could get taxi to airport right away.  This hotel was fabulous and would RETURN here upon future stay in L.V. Loved everything about it and the pool was the best along with the restaurants Pyramid Cafe and Sports Bar Public House restaurants. Signage easy flow not confusing throughout. Best statues were the 2 tomb guarding jackels on way to elevators A & B other guests should check them out. I think the hotel should move these magnificent statues to lobby. A must is Public House restaurant with server Rich; and Pyramid Cafe with server Jordan. Great food at both.  Future visitors stay here you will love it.
50,The room is clean and has a beautiful view. The hotels in Vegas are expensive I hope they should’ve offer free breakfast for their guest. Eating inside the hotel is costly. So better go some where else to eat. The staff are friendly and helpful. Check in time 3pm & 11am check out. But we checked in early so they can prepare the room and notify us once ready. It would be great if they maintain well the place. Overall I’m happy with our stay.
10,Never again will we stay here for fear of getting another room like this again.Crumbs in the bed small hairs and dirt in the bed too. The bathroom was dirty the tables too. The only thing that could have taken place was vacuuming.
50,I had an amazing time in Vegas. Before we even arrived we were informed through the app that are rooms were ready. Upon arrival we went straight up to our room mobile check in is the best!!! No wait and No problem whatsoever. Room was very neat and clean will definitely stay here again. Housekeeping staff is AMAZING!!
20,Our 4-day at the Luxor became a regrettable experience. Hotel rooms do not provide a fridge towel racks microwave or a basic coffee station. Prices at eateries are actually more expensive than Mandalay Bay right next door. Hotel staff constantly spoke loudly turned tv units loudly while cleaning other rooms during early hours and pool area was a serious disappointment. Simply be aware that the relatively low rates come at a price.
10,The customer service was horrible. Did not have a room when we showed up said they were going to have to downgrade . The room they put us in had Doritos all over the floor here in the bathroom trash talk to the wall and the AC did not work at all. And when you try to go to customer service to talk to them about your room they act like it’s not their problem and they just don’t care. This day was miserable.
50,Excellent customer service from all the staff at Luxur Hotel & Casino. Staff was professional and friendly. They made me feel like I arrived home since the moment I arrived when I requested luggage assistance until I checked out of Luxur Hotel & Casino
40,The hotel is good clean has a variety of restaurants we ate at Starbucks and The Buffet good variety and a lot of healthy choices like salads and fruits. The pool area is alright and has a pool bar with nice and cold beers.
50,Self checkout is a good thing to do so you don’t have to wait in line to leave.  The casino was clean and plenty of tables and machines to gamble. Employees were friendly. The swimming pool is nice as well.
30,Room was alright but couldn't get the shower at the right temp.i was either freezing or burnt but I usually stay somewhere better. Stay at the grand it's the perfect mix of class and trash if you're first class white trash like me
40,Rooms are clean and very quiet. The property is well maintained for a 20+ year old resort. I was very impressed with the healthier food options available at this facility.  The my only critique of the room was how dark it was. Staying in a pyramid room the room was incredibly dark. I do not recall this being an issue in my previous stays however this could also be based on my location in the pyramid previously.
30,Average hotel nothing spectacular. Diablo bartender was rude. Not only to us but to an obviously new employee as well which made it awkward to say thr least. Food choices within the hotel were not great. Talk about your run of the mill mall food court
40,MGM rewards card for military was giving us problems and it was cause us issues trying to use it for the benefits that were allowed for military personnel. Ladies at the desk said to wait 24 hours and it’s been 48 hrs. Still saying it’s an invalid card.
40,The room was very nice and we had great service as a whole. The staff was friendly and helpful and the price point was very good. The pool was amazing very clean. The drinks were a bit expensive but delicious
30,Rooms are not updated and you could easily noticed things are deteriorating. Also digital key doesn’t work properly due to weak signal if wifi or internet and since the card access is inside the elevator you are better off getting a room key to avoid this problem.
40,Our visit to the Luxor was in May 2022. We have stayed at other MGM properties before and enjoyed them but this was our first time to the Luxor. We wanted to see Carrot Top who is performing at the Luxor. Our room in the pyramid was fine and seemed recently remodeled. The elevators worked OK but using the room key to access the floor button was 50/50. The air quality in the casino was good and better than the Bellagio which I stayed at just the week before. All-in-all the a good value for the room a good time.
10,I was very disappointed in this hotel and I have always wanted to stay there. Since I started collecting the points my main reason was to stay there. I never bash a place but I will not recommend this place if asked.
50,Enjoyed our stay at the Luxor. Staff was friendly and helpful. Enjoyed the casino area and they kept the casino clean. Waitress in the casino area were friendly. Enjoyed the show at Luxor and staff were friendly.
50,The casino was phenomenal but the hotel room had several issues. We did not give a chance for the staff to fix because we did not wanna be bothered. All of the staff were very professional and took care of us.
20,I stayed in the west tower … it was a big room but very outdated …. Would never stay here again … everything was so far away from our room …. Also far end of the strip nothing around unless you walk 1 mile
40,It definitely felt like a cheaper option on the strip. The ac didn't work great in the room the sealant on the shower door was falling off and chipping paint. There aren't any gift shops and you have to go to the neighboring hotels. There aren't a many restaurants to choose from and half the ones they have were closed most of our trip. This was frustrating to my parent in laws who didn't want to have to leave for things. Overall it's not a bad hotel. Staff was nice. Things were clean. For being a less expensive option it's a good place. But if you want to visit other hotels and do other stuff you might want to spend more on the room elsewhere instead of uber everywhere.
40,We had a great stay overall! The staff was amazing! From the front desk to the pool it was a great experience. Pool layout is great. Definitely reserve a spot. You get it all day and can come and go as you please. Good selection of food within the resort and easy access to surrounding hotels.
50,The Luxor was fantastic. We checked in and were offered an upgrade so glad I did felt like Royalty. This was our first out of state trip and we both loved it! The room was beautiful and so clean. Much more amenities than expected.
50,At Luxor we were treated great and easily could have sprayed in the one resort/casino but MGM made it easy to travel throughout the Strip and sample properties. All the same the bulk of our time was within the Luxor but the Tram and Monorail were fun experiences to get tastes of the various vibes Vegasvhas to offer.
40,Luxor is one of our favorites. It is getting old but updates have it looking nice and the thing is just cool. My only complaint is the fact they do not provide a fridge unless you pay an additional $40 a day. Also no microwave or coffee maker. Did not ask how much those cost.
30,"This was first time in Vegas and I read the reviews and wasn't sure what I was getting. As soon as you walk in  you have people trying to get you with a ""free show tickets"" and comps for the hotel. ( luckily I knew this before going in because I watched some tiktoks of what to look out for) but they want to sign you up for time shares so don't fall for it ! We checked in super early and they were able to let us in which was great. Our room was spacious but did have a faint weird smell. I bring my scentsy with me on vacation so I was ok.  The location is not the best as other reviews you have to walk thru luxor to the Excalibur thru new York new York to the mgm to get to the monorail. It takes a good 20 mins.  The staff in the restaurants were always pleasant and helpful so we did like that. But again beware of the time share people ( they are everywhere at entrances and exits . ( "" are you staying till tomorrow want a free show "") people want to relax and not be hounded.  Also I wasn't aware that you can smoke the whole casino. I thought it would be sections. Nope its everywhere."
30,What you pay is what you get. We got up graded to a modern room but was not very modern no mini fridge in our room toilet was old our shower only had one door so water would get out all the time don’t know if this is how they intend it to be but bad idea. Overall it is what it is casino in my opinion small the steak house was good th.
50,Overall it was an excellent stay. I have stayed at the Luxor many times. The only complaint was that I was told I had a TV in the bedroom and also one in the living room area. There was not at TV in the sitting living room area.
20,So sad to have my vacation after two years of waiting totally disillusioned. I did know that the NFL draft was going to be happening during my stay I did not realize that I was going to be stuck in my hotel due to the road closures and transportation delays.
20,After driving 5 hours to get there the keys were not working we had to go back and forward to front desk…. After we got the keys fixed SURPRISE our room was occupied already. We had to go down again to get a new room. Such a bad experience.
50,Our second stay at the Luxor & we enjoyed it even more than the first time. The room is spacious beds extremely comfortable & temperature A/C easy to regulate. We stayed in the West Tower which is extremely convenient to the beautiful pools & the huge gym. Also very conveniently near the Rideshare pickup/dropoff area. We like this location as it has plenty of amenities nearby while not being quite in the middle of the strip. Great restaurant options & walking distance to the Park Theatre for a show we attended. Spa was lovely! I've stayed at three hotels in Vegas & this is my favourite. My only issue was the neighbours in the adjoining room could be heard through the shared door so will request a non-adjoining room next time but minimal impact.
40,The hotel is fun conveniently located and the staff was lovely. The pool was great - bar lines were short and usually easy to find seats. While the hotel is a bit dated it was a very comfortable stay. Would recommend!
30,Service was below average. No room service is provided and it took forever to answer the phone at the front desk. Cleanliness of the room was below average. There were stains in the sheets hairs from others before us in the bathroom and the water would get out of the shower because there is only one door.
30,The Luxor is an awesome design and concept. The view from the room inside the pyramid was awesome. I also liked the view of the strip from my room. The problem is it’s rooms need to get rid of the cigarette smell. It was stuck on my clothes.
50,Room was not ready for the early check in that we paid for called the front desk and they moved us to a room that was ready. Very helpful and kind.  Rooms are clean.  The table limits are too high for our group. Had to go off site to gamble.  Good places to eat on site  Resort Fee was higher than our room rate.
50,Beautiful hotel and casino the most comfortable beds in Las Vegas. I recommend Luxor to everybody the buffet is amazing. It has always been my dream to stay in such a unique shaped Hotel the rooms and service were extraordinary. My experience at the Luxor Hotel surpassed everything I had ever imagined. We are going back to Las Vegas next month and The Luxor Hotel and casino is at the top of our list.
20,Stayed at the Luxor for a family wedding.  The room was large had two queen beds and was clean.  The decor was outdated as were the furnishings.  There is no fridge in the room no tea or coffee but there was an ice bucket  The bathroom was spacious had a good shower and was clean.  Air conditioning was noisy but efficient  There was a lot of traffic noise and continuous music through night from casino.  I really don’t know why they charge a resort fee of $35 dollars plus tax for this you would be better of spending a bit more money and getting more facilities.  I am very disappointed I wasted my money on this.  .
50,From check in to checkout and everything thing between was a remarkable experience. The room was clean and everything was nice. The casino was fun and we enjoyed that as well. Plenty of food options as well
50,We stayed at Luxor for the first time the room was lovely clean and quiet not a fan of the elevators.  We were celebrating our 50th wedding anniversary lots to see and do The monorail saved a lot of walking as we are seniors Used our points from MYVEGAS for a free stay Thank You Luxor.
50,Recently visited the Luxor after being unable to travel due to pandemic restrictions.  I really enjoyed the trip and found that standards have not only been maintained but improved in many areas particularly in the Public House bar/restaurant where the staff were very polite and efficient.  Special mention goes to Host Sue La Force who was excellent in her efforts to help us both prior to and throughout our trip. She's a star.
50,Hotel was fun and busy all the time. Clean rooms and hotel. Blue man Group was at the hotel also the Titanic and Body exhibits were awesome to walk through. There was plenty of places to eat and get what ever you needed right at the hotel. The breakfast buffet was to die for. Wonderful time.
40,It was a total blast and awesome beginning for my bday!! Room was comfortable. No door on the shower was messy but it cleaned up well. Casino and buffet were inviting!!! I already have my next trip planned. I will be staying here.
50,What an amazing experience. The pyramid is like no other hotel the view from the room was amazing as well as the view above the casino. Will definitely be staying again. We also attended America’s got talent which was so much fun.
50,Very clean comfortable and private! Request of a room to accommodate my medical issue of vertigo was given a room in tower was absolutely on point! This experience was one of our best thus far! Had all you needed in this casino! Wonderful dining shopping and gambling! Thank you for the great hospitality!
50,We all enjoyed ourselves the Luxor had a lot to offer and I can’t wait to re visit we’ll be back soon!!!    The actual idea of being inside a pyramid was mind blowing and it made the experience even more thrilling.
40,Stayed here for 4 nights in May. Had a room in East tower which had two beds in which were clean and very comfortable. No shower gel or water supplied during whole stay which I think should be available in a 4 star hotel. Shampoo and conditioner were supplied. Room cleaned daily. Noisy neighbours were a problem for others I was travelling with and when they complained they were told the other party had been warned about the noise and would be removed if they did it twice…. Which they did but as they were only there for two nights I guess they didn’t care? Didn’t use the buffet as was closed when we tried. Pool area was clean with ample beds and towels but they kept closing pools off completely and by 5pm most nights they were on wind down and wanted you gone ASAP with 6 being closing time which is too early. Hotel in general was clean as were public rest rooms and there are places to get coffee and snacks.
50,Very comfortable inviting room quiet. Husband left prescription glasses in room.  Please tell me how to get these returned. Wire rims in purples & blues.Spacoius room could have used another blanket on the bed. Otherwise quiet comfortable.
50,Good times quality time well spend with family and friends. Dining was great for kids and adults Enjoyed the pool with kids shows where great . Rooms where good satisfying and relaxing. We all had a great time.
50,Great experience loved everyday I wish there was better access to rooms. Staff was great and food was amazing. I loved the fact I walked out of there with 10 gs in cash. Thank you Luxor for an amazing memory.
40,Nice space n room for last minute booking. A little dated but space is nice. Food courts plenty and tram to other hotels was nice. Check in online needs to be better and if online a map of towers would help.
40,Rooms in the pyramid were very clean and spacious. It was very cool to be in the pyramid. Registration staff was very friendly and helpful. Easy 15 minute walk to Mandalay Bay Convention Center. I wish the rooms had a refrigerator in them. Also if there’s something happening at the stadium people use Luxor parking garage leaving no spots for Luxor guests. We had to park at another hotel and walk back to Luxor.
40,The help I received trying to check in before the rest of my party was excellent! Vangie was wonderful and kind and patient! The room was nice but miss the coffee maker and in room refrigerator. Please bring them back!
50,My needs were met. Customer service was great. From the check in process the service agent was engaging. Hotel staff was friendly waiters were attentive and room attendants were accommodating. I would suggest Luxor for anyone.
50,The Suite we had was very comfortable and spacious and thanks to housekeeping looked everyday just like the first day we showed up Thanks to everyone for a very pleasant stay Pool and Buffet what a nice getaway!!
40,Hotel was in a great location. The room was always clean and the maids were nice very helpful.. Staff were very professional and helpful also. Our entire stay at the Luxor was just great. awesome BTS Army
40,Check in went very smooth staff generally friendly. Cleaning staff does a great job and hotel was cleaner than last visit. Better signage to the towers from main entry would be helpful as hotel guests always help new folks to the elevators....Once you stay a couple of times no big deal.
50,My stay was amazing! It was my first time in Vegas and I couldn’t have asked for anything better. The staff was very nice and accommodating the food was so good and the resort was absolutely beautiful.
50,Awesome resort staff very friendly. Very large resort which allowed you to walk through other resorts without leaving the building including Mandalay Bay and the Excalibur!. Highly recommended we will be back!
50,Everything was clean and comfortable. A little dated but very nice for a budget property. I liked how the casino floor was ventilated to reduce cigarette smoke. The only drawback was the distance between elevators. And once in the elevators you need a key. Sometimes this didn’t work.
50,Trip for my son’s 21st birthday. Great overall stay. Room was clean staff were friendly. Easy to charge to my room. The dealers were nice and made my son feel at ease learning new table games. The E sports lounge was a hit with both of my sons.
40,I heard a lot of bad things about Luxor but my experience was good. Clean rooms and great prices. Buffet is back open for brunch that was also good. The casino needs better airflow system for being a smoking casino. Pool was a little dirty.
50,Excellent stay from check in to check out  The casino and hotel were clean as were the restaurants. The pool was the only thing that could of been cleaner. Friendly staff friendly atmosphere. The digital check in worked perfect  10/10 stay
50,All went good nothing else much to say. Visited loca cafes Starbucks food vendors drink vendors and shows/clubs. Overall was a very good stay pool was very nice and all of the staff were friendly and helpful with whatever we needed and asked for.
40,After reading some of the reviews I was a little hesitant to book here. However the room was very good. It was large with 2 queen beds. It has been renovated some time recently. Clean except for the dirty window but we were on the 22nd floor. Bathroom definitely updated. They allow dogs but the walk from self parking to our room was rather strenuous for our 13 year old schnauzer. Although they advertised rooms for about $44/ night after you add parking fee pet fee and resort fee the cost was closer to $200/ night. Also at their food court a chicken sandwich and MIke’s Hard Lemonade was about $36!
20,I’ve stayed at the Luxor a few times though I usually try to stay elsewhere. Every time I try the Luxor again I’m reminded why I stay somewhere else.    I experienced multiple issues during my stay in the Tower Elite 2 Bedroom Suite:    -Key cards deactivated multiple times and needed to go down to the front desk each time it happened. In case you aren’t familiar with the Luxor that’s a 5-10 minute trip each way (as long as the lines aren’t too bad).  -Draining the bathtub caused the shower to back up.  -painful furniture    The staff was amazing for the most part which at least somewhat helped improve my stay. There was only 1 staff member I had issues with. Unfortunately it was on my last night and the last person I dealt with.    If you can afford it stay somewhere else. The Luxor is just not worth the hassle.
50,I absolutely loved this hotel the suite was amazing and comfortable  The dining was reasonable everything you needed was in one place this was my first time at this location and have already rebooked for another stay
40,The Luxor was a good stay but the Elevators Must be Upgraded. The Staff was very friendly and knowledgeable witch made it very easy to get where we needed to go. Very nice that it is not far from the airport with easy access to get a ride to the airport and anywhere you wanted to go.
50,Pleasantly surprised! The staff was knowledgeable friendly helpful and accommodating. Example: When I booked the room the description said there was a coffee maker included (Elite Tower King). When I got to the room there wasn't a coffee maker. I called housekeeping and she put me thru to the Hotel manager. She apologized and sent a security officer with a coffee maker coffee and condiments. He arrived in about 15/20 minutes which I think was a reasonable length of time. This is just one example of the staff doing whatever it takes to make your stay enjoyable! Very pleased!!!
40,A very cool hotel. Easily accessible location on the southern strip. Nice pool area. Rooms are rudimentary. Inclinators (pyramid shape does not provide for elevators) only service specific floors so you may be in for a long walk if your room is opposite the corner inclinator servicing your floor. A decent price for a unique hotel experience.
50,Clean amenities friendly staff easy Check in and out. When I called for extra towels and a cot the service was fast and friendly. I only stay at the Luxor whenever I come to Vegas. I love it here. Everything is here the food is great staff is amazing. I’ve never had any trouble.
30,Girlfriends birthday was what it was not the best rooms there are but not the worst. Wish there were some changes made but overall not a bad place to stay the pool area was nice and the staff was pretty friendly
30,The pyramid room we had was updated clean and quiet. However the walk-in shower causes a mess when in use. Only half of the shower has a pane of glass so showering causes water to fly out onto the ground everywhere. Although mini fridges used to be provided they’re removed now. We were provided a “cooler” for our meds but it never cooled. We ended up revising with ice. Self park via a walk-bridge is a bit of walk with luggage otherwise it’s manageable (for Vegas). Resort fees/nite ($35+ tax) are overrated.
20,I had high hopes for the Luxor. We always thought is was a neat property so finally decided to give it a try. I was underwhelmed. The whole casino is smoked up from continued cigarette use. It propagated into the restaurants as well. The rooms are dated. Most have popcorn ceilings that is a cigarette brown now. The whole place needs a remod. The west side elevator was dirty and in disrepair. We tried 2 restaurants there then ate elsewhere afterwards. Food cost were expensive. A soft drink was $4.50. I think it has potential but it's a long ways off. I went into other casinos on the strip that were clean modern and didn't reek of cigarette smoke. If you have allergies and respiratory issues stay away.
40,Went to Vegas after our previous trip (scheduled for April 2020) was canceled due to the pandemic. We weren't 100 percent comfortable flying and being around crowds of people. Three of us went - wife sister-in-law and myself. Room had two queens and was plenty large to accommodate us. Bathroom was nice with a shower and a tub. Tub came in handy for those that wanted to soak their feet after all the walking we did. staff were very helpful especially when we needed extra items we received them quickly. The Variety of slots was poor and they payouts were terrible. Getting a drink while playing was difficult. I ended up carrying a bottle of water with me for times when I would play for an extended period (and yes I tipped when I got a drink). casino and rooms were clean and not that crowded.
20,The sink and bath tub didn’t drain properly. The elevators were malfunctioning all weekend. The guest service line move extremely slow no matter the time of day. I didn’t receive on mgm rewards for my stay.
10,Drove from a California for a brief relief from the work life. Just to get worked and leave with more stress than I come with. Worst Vegas hotel experience ever! Will NEVER book here again. Probably won’t ever use my MCard again either
30,Room was nice. Attendant service was a bit lacking but once we talked to the room attendant it was all good. No coffee pot in the room but two Starbucks downstairs. I ordered my coffee then picked it up instead of waiting in the long lines. Make sure u familiarize yourself the hotel to make sure u go to the right one.Pizza place and Johnny rocket’s are downstairs. The elevator are a little rickety but they are called inclinator
30,Needs to be renovated asap!! The restaurants and stores are extremely overpriced. MGM rewards supervisory and/or management needs customer service training. Only good thing about this hotel was the bed was comfortable. I’ll never stay here again.
50,The employees are the best at this resort. Everyone I interacted with was professional and did everything within their authority to gain my satisfaction. I was with a part of ten and had five book rooms the check-in employee everything she could to keep us on the same floor. She made experience much more memorable.
20,The staff was very rude and snappy when it came to our concerns and it was shocking because I have never experienced that at the Luxor before. We were treated unfairly by security & misinformed about company policy with dogs at check in.
20,The room I stayed in had fringed print and food stings over the tables. The room smelled bad and still had the smell of who ever had the room before me. The window was so dirty that I couldn’t enjoy the view.
50,At time of check-in I should have been advised of the water would be turned off. I have stayed here before and I just love the hotel and casino this is my 3rd visit since July 2021. However I’m sure this experience could have been better if the water wasn’t off.
30,Missing some amenities. No coffee in room. No water in room upon check in. Tiny shower shelf with only one place to hang a towel. Elevators bumpy pretty bumpy. Had to get used to them going at an angle.
30,The room was spacious and it seems they did a remodel within the last 5 years. My bathroom had mold on the ceiling and there was no coffee maker. The bed were very soft and the pillows were very puffy. I am glad I brought my own. Not much of a choice of channel on the TV. Walls were thin my neighbors kept me up until 6 am!
20,We stayed at the pyramid premier suite and found the room was dirty and worst of all the sheets had blood stains on them Disgusting! Also went down to the new Starbucks and workers there where very rude
50,2 night stay for 2 people  Room was very clean and very roomy  Housekeeping very friendly  Bed very comfortable  Restaurans/ buffet was very good  Easy connection to Excalibur  Only but was the pool water was warm not sure if it is heated or because of the weather. Not a bad thing just personal preference
30,I wish the furniture was up to date. The headboards looked dirty. Location is perfect. Easy access to other hotels and the amenities is a plus. The pools were nice. Wish they were covered better for skin protection.
30,This was just an okay stay….The rooms were older there were issues with the AC and cold water only one day. The staff is very nice and accommodating. This was our first visit to Vegas. I don’t think we would be back unless rooms were updated! Overall it’s a 3 maybe.
50,Was able to procure a fantastic king bedroom suite last minute at a low cost. Staff was helpful as I was running late to a wedding and got me there well in time. Clean friendly great location and views!
10,There were roaches in the room.  That is nasty & made us very uncomfortable we couldn’t leave anything down & I will have to leave everything outside when I get home so no bugs come in my house. People are so nasty
50,The hotel was much better than expected and with more life than I remember. I loved that its conected with the mandalay and how is very accesible to get in and out of to get taxy or uber. rooms where clean and serviced adecuately. overall great stay
10,I paid for several services I never received. Check in took over 4 hours despite I paid for early check in. They didn't honor my reservation or room type. Then i was double charged because i was checked into the wrong room & had to be rechecked in. On top of that Debbie charge me more for the same room I had already upgraded & purchased. When I escalated to a manager she didn't apologize or anything just waived the $10 upgrade fee as if she was doing me a favor. I had already paid for this. The rooms AC didn't work. I reported it and the tech came after 5 hours to look at it. He agreed with me it wasn't working kept looking me up and down & asking inappropriate questions until my fiance came back & then he left & never fixed the problem. Nor did anyone from the hotel ever address the issue again despite 2 more calls. The soaking tub was dirty & stained. It was just a horrible experience for my fiances 1st trip to Vegas & as much as i paid.
10,I had MGM rewards that I was able to use for dining gambling and room rates. From the second I stepped into the lobby things started going south. Check-in was delayed 5 hours there was little to no communication from the staff. The Pyramid Cafe food was horrendous mostly the eggs( wet and seemed to sit in a steaming tray) and the hash browns(crispy outside cold raw potato inside). Room service stops when the cafe closes. Wall outlets don't work A/C units don't cool down the room much toilet paper is so far from the toilet it is a chore even at 6' to reach it guest services for the room and front desk couldn't get an extra blanket or anything I asked for. I have compiled a list of more than a dozen issues I had in the four nights I was there. The elevators/inclinators were horrendous. One you can only have one person select a floor at a time then everyone has to wait to get to that floor to select the next one it took going to 9 floors just to get to mine which was only floor 7 and also one elevator metal panel and doors were falling off. I have so much more to list. If you have rewards and get things comped but only go to other MGM properties it is okay but almost anything to do at the Luxor made the trip just seem like a chore. Also the pool closes very early thought that was odd.
10,Do not waste your money and time with this hotel. Photos online do NOT reflect the condition of the hotel. The lobby is nice but the rest of it is run down and trash everywhere. If you have a room facing the strip you look down at the lobby and its nice. If you are on any of the other 3 sides you will see full garbage bags and loose garbage that have been tossed on the roofs of the internal establishments in the pyramid dirt on walls and ceilings. If I were on a girls trip I would NOT feel safe walking to my room down those long narrow sketchy hallways to my room. Do not recommend to single ladies.    Our first room was on the side we switched after one night because the AC was not working. Staff was helpful in moving us and there was no difficulty with the request.  Our room was clean and the bed was comfortable. The shower pressure was great. You do NOT get anything extra in these rooms that you would find in regular hotels such as coffee makers refrigerators or microwaves. Apparently you can pay $25 extra per day for a fridge.    Elevators are AWFUL. 2 were broken each the entire time we were there and the 2 that were working always had a large lineup that went down the hall and around the corner (20-30 people) that required you to wait 10-15 min each time you wanted to use it. When you were able to get into a working one it typically bypassed your floor at least once usually twice before stopping at it.    We had an issue with the employee running the taxi line. He greeted us and immediately began talking very disrespectfully about 4 larger black women he had just put into a cab before us. They were still getting situated and he was making fun of them. He then made culturally inappropriate and just flat out ignorant comments about a black man 2 cars down. We complained to the staff at the counter who advised they would speak to him.    The pools look very nice from afar. On our 2nd day at the pool there was a large floating puddle of vomit. It was a quick deterrent and did not get cleaned the entire time we were down there. The pools were not actively maintained as there were several employees around the pools. The lifeguard was approximately 10 feet away from the puke puddle.    Everything in the Luxor will cost you. This is fine and I don't mind paying to enjoy my getaways - I have a problem when the cost far outweighs the value. In this case cleanliness and professionalism. They are charging you on a 5 star basis but offering you 2 star (at best) service/quality - at BEST. Late check out of 2 hours will ring you $60.00. The resort fee is outrageous for what you get here. I like to try a different hotel each time I come to Vegas and will recommend several amazing ones that I have experienced (ARIA being my favorite so far) but I will never stay at the Luxor again nor will I recommend it.    It is also quite a hike from the main strip so be prepared for lots of walking to get literally anywhere - NOTE: we knew this when we booked but anticipated being at the hotel more to enjoy the amenities and pool etc. so did not mind. When we saw the state of the hotel and amenities we ended up being on the strip much more.
50,Look it’s nowhere near the nicest most opulent biggest or best casino on the strip but it feels quaint while also being large. I love the “vibe” that is created by the lighting high ceiling (due to pyramid shape) and music. It’s a low pressure easy to navigate fun time!
40,Our room was in the west tower. It was clean modern and had plenty of room to move around. Clearly some of the newer area in the property. The west tower is also close to the pool if you are into that. The elevators were fast we never had to wait for more than a few seconds and after staying at the W-gate this is a huge deal. The proximity to the Mandaly and the Excalibur makes this place seem even bigger and better than it really is. There is almost no reason to leave this 3 properties.
40,Stayed for the 2022 U.S. Open wrestling championships. Great proximity to everything. Great service. Would stay in towers next time. Plenty of opportunities to gamble. I would recommend this hotel to friends.
50,Great value and easy access from the parking to the registration and the hotel rooms. Hotel always smells nice. The 24-h mini-market is very convenient for late late very late snacks/drinks etc. Shops are nice too.
40,Overall my family and I had a great stay. Ride share was easy in and out and the hotel was clean. Built in the 90's the Luxor doesn't have the glam of the central strip casinos but it was half the price. The staff were all very welcoming and helpful. Decent restaurants too (Mexican deli Starbucks buffet food court). HOWEVER 3/4 elevators in our wing were broken throughout the stay. I reported the issue to hotel registration but this was a huge problem - traffic wise. Guests were livid at the waits. The broken elevators MUST be addressed.
50,I did a turn around trip for my anniversary. I was able to book a room last minute and everything went very smooth. Would recommend! It was a little bit pricey because of the last minute booking but the husband and I had such a great time!
40,I stayed at the older section but room was spacious with clean linens. There is a tunnel connected to the Excalibur so it’s convenient you don’t need to walk in the strip. There is also a food court there. Two Starbucks at the hotel. Online check in and out through the app on the phone is the best so you don't need to get in line.
10,Too far south on strip poor upkeep limited uses of amenities excessive fees. Limited options. One positive is its close to Mandalay Bay and Raiders stadium. Not crowded. Cheap. Spend more and stay near Caesars palace or north of it
20,Different room than reserved! Poor lightning in the room couldn’t see especially in the bathroom in from of the make up mirror. Very disappointed considering the money we paid for both rooms. Also elevators stopped on every floor unlike in the pyramid causing delays.
40,Very good staff with a lot of this to deal with. Good value and an overall satisfying experience. The only real issue was the elevators which seem in need of maintenance. We had to wait long times on occasion as they kept breaking down. But in the big picture everything was well handled. An enjoyable stay!
50,Excellent values for weekday stay and nice exotic style. Staff are friendly and food is very good. Excellent location and free tram is a plus. Suggest add refrigerator and coffee maker. Would like to recommend it to friends.
10,This was the worst hotel i have ever stayed at in my life. I was there for two days and I had to change my rooms 4 different times. The 1st room bed was broke. The 2nd room was dirty had old food and the couch was extremely dusty and dirty. 3rd room the put me in was extremely hot come to find out that room was suppose to be taken off the market due to the fact the ac didn’t work smh and mind you I’m 6months pregnant and I’m in the room sweating and crying because I’m so overwhelmed w. Having to keep changing rooms. by the time the put me in the 4th room I was completely over being there. And on top of all of that I was told that some money would be taken off because of all the problems I was having but yet they still changed me the full price smh I had to dispute it w. My bank. I would absolutely never stay at the This hotel again
40,Overall my experience at Luxor was satisfying I’ve always wanted to stay there and am happy that I did the casino was nice but it was a very long walk to our rooms but there really isn’t anything anyone can do about that because we stayed in the west tower other than that it was a great experience
20,No one uses Trip Advisor anymore. Luxor’s infrastructure is out dated. Some of the elevators weren’t functioning at all. It was a hassle to get from the casino to the rooms. The rooms were clean. The water pressure in the shower was low. Hot water was very limited.
10,Terrible. Never stay here. Maintenance man just walked in in the middle of the night. Of all the hotels on the strip I have stayed at. An I’ve been in most of them. This is the absolute worst. Stay somewhere else
50,Luxor is a beautiful hotel. Close to the strip. Excellent staff and restaurants. Food was great for the price at the buffet. The bar dj was great on friday night. Clean rooms. We had a great time. I would definitely come back.
30,Our room was next to a service elevator so it was loud. The view was blocked entirely by an AC unit. You had to rent a refrigerator…one is not provided in the room. Overall I was not impressed. Next time I visit Vegas it will be a different hotel/casino.
50,Had an amazing time  from checking in to checking out  great time  I’m ready for the next trip. Love the oasis pool  food quality at the Diablo cantina  casino staff always attentive to your needs.
10,We stayed in a Corner King Suite and spent over $2k to have a room with zero AC nothing done to correct it and has to use 2 fans just to be able to sleep at night. On top of all that I got trapped in two different elevators at two different times for 20 min and 15 minutes and no one was willing to do anything about it. 4 staffs and 2 managers later we received zero resolutions and no comps or upgrades or even an apology!
20,"The room we were offered an ""upgrade"" to was exceptionally disappointing. The sink was clogged the bar on the shower door was broken the shower world not get hot there was no microwave the room stayed hot even with the air on the coolest setting. Staff did nothing to remedy these issues.    The hotel amenities as far as restaurants bars and shops are its only upside keeping it from a 1/5 star venue."
20,Other than it being free I wouldn't have stayed here. Next time free or not?? Won't be stating here again. Room smelled so bad like smoke. I smoke and even I couldn't take it. Supposed to be a smoke free room. Couldn't wait to get home to wash my clothes. It's just run out of time .... its filthy and the only thing this place has going for it are the pools. Location is aweful as well. Again free next time for me?? I will pass. Rather pay for another property than do this place again. Second time was not a charm
40,We enjoyed our stay at Luxor. My wife especially enjoyed some of the newer video slot machines she found in the casino. Our room was very clean and spacious. We rarely waited more than a few seconds for an elevator!! The staff was very friendly at check in and also in the casino.
50,One elevator out of the four was extremely shaky. However the one night stay was wonderful! Some of the cocktail waitresses we're inattentive but we met one that was attentive and very pleasant. The cafe had really good food and the wait staff was great.
50,Stayed here with a mate in April 22 so surprised how modern/luxurious the rooms are. King premium rooms in west tower are huge and the decor is great. Very reasonably priced the pools are brilliant and the hotel facilities are immense. Plenty of shows huge casino floor space only slight negative is the fact it is right at one end of the strip but it’s really not far about 20-30mins walk to get to the central hotels.    Would highly recommend especially if on a budget cannot get better for the price
30,The wife and i where very exited to be on our first vacation without kids in our 15 yoers of marraige. booked through travelocity booked king sweet ended up with reservations for a king bed no sweet had to contact travelocity and go through a lengthy process of canceling the room to rebook what we wanted. paid for early check in at 11 was not able to enter room till 1. very poor maintained hotel for the price multiple cracks in drywall and paint missing trim and peeling wallpaper in the bathroom. bed was really comfy.
20,Immediately upon arriving at the hotel we were greeted by someone who referred to himself as some sort of concierge who led us to a desk where someone tried to schedule us to attend a timeshare pitch. We found this to be a distasteful first impression of the hotel.  We were pleasantly surprised to find there was no line up at the check in counter and check in went quickly. As we headed to our room we noted the property seemed tired and in need of some cleaning and maintenance. Wallpaper was peeling walls were scuffed the inclinator doors were shaking floors in need of cleaning. The greatest surprise was when we opened to door of our room and found unmade beds and towels on the bathroom floor. We were returning to the front desk when we encountered housekeeping a couple of rooms down the hall from our room who was startled and upset to learn we were given a room that she hadn't cleaned. She said it would be cleaned right away and that we could leave our luggage in the room. We put the suitcase on the stand and I hung up my jacket in the closet and we left the room.  The morning of our departure we packed our bags and I went to the closet to get my jacket and was upset to find the closet was empty. We went to the front desk where I was handed a phone to listen to a recorded message that instructed me to go to the Luxor site and fill out a form to report the missing jacket. I also left a voicemail message. When I told the front desk clerk we had to leave for the airport very soon she suggested we check with the security desk as they had access to the list of articles that had been turned in (I thought it may have been possible that housekeeping thought my jacket belonged to the previous occupants of our room). Long story short security could not find it on their list a security officer went to the front desk and spoke to a manager on my behalf and we were offered a comp of our resort fees. I am grateful we received something but I really needed that jacket to keep warm on the flight home especially as it was just 38 degrees Fahrenheit when we landed and all I had was a t-shirt.  I travel frequently and have never had something taken from my room before. It may have been due to the room not being ready when we arrived but if that was the case the jacket should have been turned in. We definitely will not be returning to this property.
20,The signs guiding you are confusing to follow on your first visit. The layout sometimes feels like a maze compared to other casinos. Once we got into the hotel room there was trash in one of the dressers as well as lots of hair and red stains in the bathroom. None of that was cleaned up when we left. We slept fine but was worrying about the quality of the bed if nothing else was cleaned when a guest left.    Other than that service is somewhat as you would expect from an MGM hotel. I’d rather stay somewhere else the next time even if the rooms were free. Got free rooms from the MGM apps.
50,Quick trip to LV for draft weekend. Luxor always comes through with value service and accommodations. Facility has stepped up quest service always welcomed and feel very comfortable and safe in the Luxor. Be on the look out for Pool host Miguel he is the best. Pool servers Jesse Brittney and Soco are spot on service . While gaming Bonnie Crystal Jennifer and Roxy keep the drinks flowing. Give them all a shout out
50,I recently stayed at the Luxor Hotel & Casino. The room casino area and restaurants were nice. I ate at the Tender restaurant and had a very delicious steak that was cooked perfectly to my liking. They provided a great atmosphere.
50,10+ Luxor resort met all my resort needs with excellent professionalism from front desk to room service pool service food service with variety of food would stay here again any day thank you for excellent service best hotel on the strip
50,Our second trip back since the pandemic. Most everything is reopened and operating normally. Our stay in the Luxor Tower Suite was very pleasant. Housekeeping came in daily and did a great job. Went to some shows with the Beatles Love at Mirage being fabulous and a trip highlight. Definitely worth seeing again. Everyone we encountered was very pleasant and happy to see visitors again. Will be back soon for more shows and great food.
20,Room was nice but located at least a mile from parking. Card key didn’t work in parking garage and hotel line was always so long we didn’t get the card fixed. Couldn’t win anything. We were on the 16th floor and could still hear traffic outside. Slots were tight. Lost a lot of money without winning a little to keep playing.
20,"Booked this hotel for 1 night while traveling to Utah on business. Was given a room on the 14th floor in the pyramid. The room was clean but the mini-fridge and safe had been removed from the room. The shower had a partial glass door which allowed the water to accumulate on the floor and causing a dangerous slipping hazard. There was so much water that 3 towels would not soak all of it up. Our travel partners also stayed in a room on the 7th floor and experienced the same issue. The phone in our room did not work. When we reported it they said they would have someone right up. After waiting an hour we gave up and headed out for dinner. We placed a Do Not Disturb sign on the door. When we returned they had changed out our phone. They left us a phone message that said ""We saw the sign on the door so we could not enter to swap the phone"" but they entered anyways! WTH! My advise is stay somewhere else its not worth the low rates they are quoting."
40,Most everyone that works here is very attentive friendly knowledgeable and accommodating! MGM has alot of different experiences to offer however this is one thar is worth checking out. Even if you try other hotels it's nice to change it up!
10,Stayed at Luxor for my sister’s birthday and from the check in to the remainder of the stay let me tell you… it just kept topping itself in more and more horrible experiences. Started out at check in the lady was rushing through the entire check in and honestly seemed to be annoyed by just my very presence lol! I didn’t even bother to even dare ask for anything out of the basics as in just putting my boyfriend on the room and asking for a room number when she gave us the key. I couldn’t get out of her sight fast enough it seemed. So then we went followed her super vague directions to how to get up to our room and got lost as she told us the wrong elevator (it was 3B not 3A). Finally got up to the room and set our stuff down and went to look at the view we had and right as I pulled back the curtain there right in front of my face was a disgusting greasy handprint so I moved the curtain more and sure enough there were hand prints and even what I would guess was possible face prints as well. Soooo gross! Then my boyfriend was washing his hands and the sink started to fill up rather quickly so the sink was clogged as well. We actually ended up just using the shower for water to brush our teeth/ wash up etc since the sink never fully drained the entire stay. Then to top it all off we were trying to turn the AC and tried EVERYTHING and this thing just wouldn’t stop and it would just randomly switching on and off making it ridiculously cold! So we ended up calling the front desk for service when we just couldn’t take it anymore. They said they were dealing with a “flood” in another room and they would be up as soon as they could which ended up being 1:00 AM when we were dead asleep. The service man stated that our room was actually being controlled by a different room!!! I didn’t even know that was possible so very weird! So he finally got it fixed and left. Come Sunday morning we could not check out fast enough between the lack of sleep and the disgusting state and maintenance of the room. Flash forward to when I get home and I kept getting a “how was your stay?”email so I decided to call and let them know how it actually was as I didn’t really want to sign up for trip advisor just to give feedback but here I am so you can imagine how that went with that phone call lol! I spoke with a Yessica and she told me her manager was busy he had told her to tell me to email guest relations and they would get back to me in two weeks!! So yea it was horrible.
20,Hotel very dark. Too much value engineering in renovated baths which caused entire floor to flood. Nice new towels.  No internet in room. No way to contact front desk except to physically go down there. Staff nice. Location good for Mandalay Bay convention. Resort fee a rip off.
20,There was an insect I believe cocroch in our bed's headboard. The elevators seemed like they were going to break down. I dont get what the resort fee is for there was only one pool opened they charge 230 for a cabana
40,This was a fun trip out to Las Vegas for the NFL DRaft. Luxor us conveniently located close to the strip and was a short Uber/Lyft ride to the places I went to off the strip. The weather was awesome as well!
50,Hotel stay was great other than the issue we had at the pool. I would definitely tell other people about the nice stay but I will also inform them of the issues my husband and I had at the pool area.
10,Check in staff at the luxor has to be the worst on the entire strip. I always have a bad experience at luxor but continue to stay there because gambling was always good. This trip they had zero perks.
30,Rooms a little outdated. Pool area is very nice and service there was good too. Wish the elevator and room wasn't so far away; felt like it took forever. The casino is nice and the food court is sufficient for late night snacks. Bars are good with steady crowd and very good service.
30,Woke up to drilling on the walls at 7 in the morning our neighbors even knocked and wondered if it was us said they would make a complaint but not sure if they did because It kept going all morning.
10,This place is to much to not have nothing nice in the rooms! And the running water at night is the kicker the shower overflow is bad. Room Service is nasty. Nobody speaks English. Had to find someone that did. Just a ugly stay this time. And never again  !
30,It is at the end of the strip but connected by tram. Don't go there looking for recommendations. They will direct you to MGM properties only and won't help with anything else. Chairs at from bar were so bad that we only stayed for 5 minutes. Nothing in room except bare essentials.
10,I fell at the jaccuzi on 4/22/22 my face hit a metal sign as I was getting out of the jaccuzi. My face hit the sign so hard I fell to the ground from the impact. No one from the Luxor did a incident report. I had to ask for ice myself.    The next day after realizing no one called me about the incident I had to call in to report the incident myself. I even told the pool staff that gave me the ice I fell and they didn’t say anything . I’m very disappointed in the way I was treated by the staff of the Luxor hotel and the lack of concern to where no one did a report.
30,Nice property but the room was way too far away from the casino/front desk and overlooked a roof and this is not what I expected on my first trip. Better view would definitely get you a better rating.
30,When we walked in there was a strong smell of marijana which was a theme throughout the stay wherever you went. We had to change rooms as the first one smelled musty and had burned out light bulbs. The staff were friendly and accomodating but the hotel needs a facelift
10,Well I went a night before my husband to get ready for a wedding. The next day I missed his texts and calls because this place has terrible reception so I didn’t see when he got there. He went ahead and tried checking in himself so he can just get a key and they said he wasn’t in the room. (Yes he was. First thing I did was add him) The staff told him to purchase his own room. The room didn’t have a fridge or any kind of water bottles or liquor bottles for even sell. I even upgraded to the premium king room. Just sad excuse of a hotel for Vegas.
30,Outdated needs a face lift bad. Needs something more. The casino was small and outdated. No real restaurant or they were closed. No real shopping or stores. Food that we ate was average but nothing to talk about.
20,Staff very rude. We asked someone for directions to self parking and when we said where he told us to go was barricaded he called us liars. The room a/c barely worked it was cooler outside. Would have been nice if they had a mini fridge in the room
20,This was my 2nd time staying here. Loved it the 1st time but this 2nd trip was a NO GO. Had to change rooms plumbing was very slowing (sink/tub) hallways was dirty all 4 days n 3 nights we were there from elevator to room not once cleaned same spot/stain was there. I was already past about asking about a fridge.
40,Pool was awesome clean nicer than what I was expecting  We stayed in the stay well room very nice as well clean  Check in was easy hotel staff is nice  Hotel is nice quiet at times  Close to the welcome Las Vegas sign  Hotel is located at the end of the trip but is close enough to everything  Don’t let the negative reviews scare you  I’ve been to Vegas about 7 times and I definitely would stay at the Luxor again
10,I recently visited Vegas with two friends and stayed at Luxor an MGM property. Between the three of us we brought a collective $10000 to gamble. We signed up for the rewards card and always presented the card when we bought in at the tables. Over 4 days we each played blackjack or craps for an average of 7 hours a day.    The hotel was fine and took most of our meals there.    Both my buddies lost all their cash. I came out slightly ahead.    The problem? When we checked out NONE of us were comped anything. I will never play at an MGM property again.
50,Recently I had the chance to stay at the Luxor in Las Vegas while I was in town covering Cinemacon.    I had visited the resort a few times before to take in a show exhibit look around and enjoy the buffet but this was my first time staying at the locale.    Upon arriving I parked in self-parking which offers one day of free parking per day of your stay and then charges a timed rate that caps at $15.00 per day.    The parking has easy access to the walkway into the resort and I passed the pools which were loaded with guests eager to take in the sun.  The line to check in was huge as not only was Cinemacon in town but the NFL Draft was getting ready to start in a few days and considering that Las Vegas is always a popular destination I took advantage of the App check-in and Kiosk to make my own key to my room and avoid a wait.    I did get lost as there are various banks of elevators that go to certain floors and they are located at various points so I did have to ask and walk around to find the correct one but this did allow me a chance to see more of the food and drink options as well and shops that I had not encountered on prior visits.    The elevator ride did take some getting used to as it did not sound not move in the way that I expected and I learned that it actually moved in a sideways fashion as it ascended due to the Pyramid design of the building.    Once I reached the floor I was treated to a great view of the Lobby from 20 floors up but I did wonder about the railing only being waist-high as I walked to my room.    The room was very clean and inviting and larger than expected as I had a King Bed and a Flat Screen television as well as a safe desk and chair and a very large shower and plenty of space.    The room also offered a great view of the nearby resorts and city and was something to behold at night as well as when the sun arose.    With a tight schedule I met up with my Brother-In-Law who lives locally to do some shopping for my wife who was not able to join me on this trip and pick up some food and the resort had a very easy access area in which to catch or exit all forms of vehicles.    Since I was busy with the convention and since we still have Covid to contend with I kept my dining and entertainment largely in-room but I did make sure to get the new rewards card to replace my outdated one and the Wi-Fi and channels in the room were more than enough to keep me entertained after a long day and the very comfy bed and adjustable climate controls were perfect for the warm days and cold nights.    My check out was very easy as it was done via the app and staff suggested I leave my car where it was for the day and pick it up when I returned from my last day at the convention.    I was so impressed with my all too short stay that I suggested to my wife that when we are able to we make a point of looking into a stay here as our usual method is to come in January for CES and while we have a hotel we have used on recent trips that is more relaxed and ideal for our schedule then the Luxor would be an ideal alternate.
10,Check in process was horrible - borderline racist. was charged a 200 deposit & others that I know that stayed wasn’t! When I spoke to the managers on duty they wouldn’t give me info to escalate the issue.
40,Very nice with lots to do. Rooms are nicer in the tower but pyramid rooms are closer to everything except the pool. Fridges are available for a fee but no microwaves at all. Aside from that it is beautiful with the Egyptian decorum. There are various food options with a couple being 24 hours. It is located on the southern end of the strip so it’s a lot of walking to some of the major resorts but within walking distance of various other things. Overall it’s beautiful and I would return and recommend to anyone.
20,Celebrating 25th wedding experience and it was a disaster. Our joint room neighbor had out room smelling like weed.Call down to desk to complain and to get room deodorize. No one never came. All our clothes was smelling like weed. Next door also had a crying baby that cried all night long....just was a miserable stay at luxor. We have stayed before and throughly enjoyed it our stay. Which is why I pick luxor to celebrate 25yrs
50,Stay was comfortable rooms were clean the staff was polite and courteous plenty of things to do inside . I had a wonderful time with a great experience for me and the group I was with. The only thing that I would change is possibly a refrigerator in the room I meal prep and had no where to put my meals. Other than that it was a awesome experience.
10,Wallpaper coming off the walls & mold behind those walls if you dare to look. Self-service parking is really far if you have lots of baggage or are handicapped so don't bother. Restaurant selection is lacking especially mid-week but also expect to give them all your personal information to be on their waitlist. No privacy is protected when it comes to their waitlist-sorry! Expect to also walk really far to your elevators for your room. There's nothing special about this hotel that was once grandiose when it first open (I was there that first year)...there are much nicer (and closer) hotels to stay at. The only thing going for it was that I got a suite room at a cheap price...but now I know why. If none of these things bother you and you want a suite room then go for it but buyer beware.
50,Had a great time with my family....the hotel was clean and the staff was friendly. There were plenty of food options. Great place to stay if you want to be away from the crowds. The pools were nice but close early (6pm)
40,Pros: Clean large room plenty of spots to eat housekeeping close to McDonalds if you have kids easy UBER spot elevators for upstairs not close    Cons: NEVER saw a concierge (had to always ask the drink worker questions Not Smoke free hard to find room in 4B when the sign was around the corner for directions no shade for pool area
40,Very spacious and nice could do a better job of cleaning the rooms. Dust and debris on the floors. Over all it was a nice suite. The bathroom was very nice. The only problem was the suede sofa had stains but we put a sheet over it and it was fine.
30,New MGM rewards is better in some ways worse in others. For our group of friends who stay the property twice a year the new bump towards Tier credits is nice however the removal of applicable activities that apply towards the room fee is abysmal at best.
40,Great quick getaway for the family! We enjoyed staying here. Wish the rooms were renovated sometime soon. It’s a flash back to the 90s walking into the rooms. One of the cooler structures to walk into though!
10,My boyfriend and I were staying at the Luxor casino from 4/22/22 - 4/26/22. We were gone all night the final evening of our trip and upon returning to our room we noticed almost all of our possessions were stolen. All of our luggage clothes electronics and sentimental items were taken some that can never be replaced. There was no forced entry so someone must have used a key card to access the room. I know for a fact that the door had been securely shut before we left. We filed a report with hotel security but they could only give us a $25 meal ticket. We are now filing a report with LVPD and local Austin (our hometown) police. The fact that there was no forced entry is even more concerning. Someone was able to access our room with a key card and take our belongings. If it happened to us it could happen to anyone staying here.
40,Had check in issues even though it was late at night. Had to go to desk & got a slight upgrade but was an avoidable issue. Gaming was good drinks weren’t horribly priced food options solid…. Just far from the action of center strip. Better for families than partiers I’d say. Comfort foam mattresses kicked A tho… very comfy
50,I would definitely come back again to the Luxor! Great place to visit and good experience. I look forward to returning one day soon. Room and service was great. I appreciate the hospitality I received
40,We spent three nights in Las Vegas -- two at MGM Grand and 1 at Luxor and I must say MGM was such a disappointment; compared to that Luxor honestly felt like a much better choice. Our room was unique -- it had slanted glass windows overlooking the main road and insanely cool elevators that rose at an angle (unnervingly shaky at first glance but you get used to it). The casino was a lot of fun - I loved the theme - and the whole vibe was much nicer than at MGM Grand. Wish we'd stayed longer here.
50,I loved the atmosphere of the hotel. The check in experience was super quick and easy. The room was spacious and the beds were comfortable. We also loved spending time at the pools. My only complaint was getting nauseated on the elevator rides. Lol!!!
10,No hospitality from any of the staff annoyed at questions that should have been easy to answer and the couple next door were so loud during their sexual exploits if they didn’t film it that is a waste
40,We had a great time during our stay. Hotel was clean rooms were nice and clean. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Online check-in was easy and fast. Amenities are well kept. I can't complain everything was good.
50,Easy access to food court/restaurants downstairs by front desk and Casino area  Service was excellent food was awesome best way to eat crab legs and ribs Steak chicken mashed potatoes Mac & cheese - all worth the money
50,Customer service was decent the hotel was fantastic and very clean the room itself was dusty on the window sill and the base of the toilet looked like it hadn't been wiped down before we checked in.
30,This hotel was clean enough.The food was mainly way over priced with 2 coffees at the Pyramid Cafe costing 10 dollars. On the Casino floor the cocktail waitresses were very hard to find ti get a drink.We went up to the bar an put money in2 machines an the bartender still charged us 20 dollars for a beer an 1 drink. Used the MGM cards in the casino games spent at least 3000 in spins an received a whole 10 dollars in comps. Will go to another hotel next time
10,For $350 per night I was expecting way more. But ultimately I would have been happy with even a nice hotel. The Luxor is not even that. The hotel from the lobby to the hallway to the room is just worn out. The exterior of the property was littered with trash which I expected to a certain extent at night but not in the morning. Luxor didn’t even bother cleaning up all of the trash around their property by morning. Huge disappointment all around at that price point. I highly recommend spending the difference and staying at another hotel. Stay away from Luxor.
50,Loved this hotel! The Titanic exhibit was my favorite! Will be returning 🥰 food was delicious and staff was very nice! Near the strip and convenient. Our room was clean and bed was so comfy slept like a baby 🥰
20,Bachelorette party was definitely not all we thought. I was disappointed in the staff mostly it seemed like they weren't in the mood for our party atmosphere which was sadly unexpected for a Vegas vacation
40,I always love staying at Luxor it is the center of so many things to do. I really do not have to leave the Luxor to do anything that's what I like about staying at the Luxor. I also like the pool. It's really nice.
40,Beautiful resort check in staff and bell service were very helpful. Room very clean and comfortable. Only issue was a leaky faucet. The food at the buffet was good as was Tender steakhouse and Diablo Cantina. The staff at pool and spa were excellent. The food at pool also was excellent. And the show Fantasy was great.
10,I killed 2 roaches in my room within the 1st 10 mins of being there. I stayed in the west tower and the hike to the hotel is CRAZY!!! The food at The Tender is pricy and comes out warm. NO STEAM WHATSOEVER!!! The casino is a dud. I was expecting a casino party! More like a snooze fest. They are not offering room service and they don't tell you that! Had to find that out on my own! Vending machines are never working! This hotel literally comes with no incentives or even perks. Even the timeshare presentations suck!! The place for the timeshare is so freaking far from the hotel it is CRAZY!!!
40,I will start this saying I love MGM properties. This was my first stay at Luxor and I would stay here again. The mobile check-in was a breeze I was able to skip the line which I'm guessing was an hour long and get to my room before normal check-in time.  I've always enjoyed the restaurants and casino even the entertainment I've seen Carrot Top I think 4 times. The room was nice large and quiet. My only problem was a towel that was supposed to be clean was full of hair. Not just a strand or two but full so much some of it fell on the ground when I put it on the hook outside the shower. I only noticed it because I saw a hair hanging from the towel. I opted out of housecleaning but called down to get the towels swapped out and asked that they clean the bathroom. I got the towels but they didn't touch the bathroom or take the other towels so the hair was still there. I cleaned it myself not a big deal.
40,Good stay but expected more from room and experience. Thought I booked a better room. One tv didn’t work and I had y to o reset the other to make it work. For a suite it was on a lower floor with not much of a view. It was two bedrooms but the were just connected not the same room.
20,The sign in process was difficult as no one was there to help. You check in by mobile phone. And try to find the correct elevator for your room. We walked around for what seemed like an hour before we were correctly directed. Signage is relatively poor. Room was so so without many amenities. TV was not HD.
50,A Nice comfortable bed  A Very Quite room  Had a Nice shower  A very Nice Hotel  Good customer service! Front Desk Lux Vegas Store and Lux Market  A very nice stores inside the hotel  My stay everything went well :)
20,We had our first family visit in LV at Luxor. Impressive hotel and very large room but not much to entertain our kids. Choose Excalibur instead and make sure you are there on the weekdays of the good shows (we were not). The in-room enterainment system charged us for watching 5 minutes of a movie without giving any notice or warning. Pretty poor.
30,Even with the 2 comp nights we got we won't be staying here again. Buffet was not good although the staff was great. Room wasn't very clean. Pool situation was good. Walk to elevators seemed long due to there locations in the building.
30,The room was on the large side so that was good. However the lack of a refrigerator when there was a place for it was unsatisfactory. Also on moat days I had to track down someone to get soap shampoo and body lotion. The pool was nice. The drink prices were insane. Lastly the buffet was way overpriced and the hours for the buffet and dining was poor. The Pyramid elevators were in poor shape.
20,Pillows were comfortable! Service was good. Very clean downstairs in the casino area and second floor. Rooms were very outdated. Elevators took such a long time! Walls were cracking. Hooks missing in bathroom for towels. So many things. It just needs an upgrade. I paid too much for a suite and for what I got.
10,The hotel looked like a sanctuary for drug addicts. It was dirty people hanging around smoking and creating unnecessary drama. I was expecting the astetics to be welcoming and feels like the ultimate get-away. The place was so ghetto and dirty!
50,I had a room in the east tower 19th floor. It has a great view of the strip. The rooms are beautiful and the bed is very comfortable. I had a great night rest before my meeting. The sports book was awesome also. Thanks for the wonderful stay Luxor.
40,Love the stay. I checked in 4 hours earlier free of charge and love the casino area. They have limited food selections which makes it so you may have to go to other casinos to find something in your price range. Only had one issue with bartender while we're there when we asked about the nearest dispensery was located. But overall great stay!
40,Like my topic Luxor is a good place to stay friendly staff easy to check in and check out. But the hardware facilities are kinda old and there are lights not working in our room. I hope they remodel soon. Everything else are good.
30,The hotel has a weird smell. There is no comforter on the bed only sheets and a thin quilt. The mattress is very uncomfortable and caused me to have hip pain. We used the digital key and got stuck in the elevator (recommend getting a key card)
20,"As a platinum rewards player I was expecting much better treatment with the comp I was receiving. However I checked in and was surprised to find myself in the ""basement"" with no view out the window and no wifi reception."
20,This hotel leaves much to be desired. My friends room was robbed including jewelry from the safe (inside job). Pool closes way too early at 6. This hotel would only be used in a pinch to sleep bathe and go.
40,Friday thru Monday stay. 1st time in Vegas with tickets to a Golden Knights hockey game. Unique building which is very cool. Close to the airport. Walking distance T-Mobile Arena for the game.  Check-in was nice (arrived several hours early) - they checked us in and then sent a text when our room was ready (about 30 - 45 minutes exploring the building). Then used the text QR code at a kiosk to get our room keys. Very nice. Room and facility were clean. Would have been nice to have a mini-frig to keep our water bottles cooled. Over-all a very good experience.  Don't know how it would be for those who have luggage waiting for an early check-in. We just had carry-on back packs so easy to keep with us while we waited.
30,The main room was nice. the beds were a bit aged sagging towards the middle. the inside of the credenza was quite...well loved. the bathroom was visually appealing but functionally lacking like the shower soaking over half of the bathroom floor upon EVERY use. We could still smell smoke in the rooms and the food options were minimal and highly overpriced.  it was a good stay but the stay overall was just okay.    The pool area was nice we visited at towards the end of the day on sunday there were used towels everywhere and trash hadn't been picked up in a while.    #doyourememberwhenVegaswascheap? it isn't anymore. Everything was soooo overpriced.
50,Had a pleasant time as I always do here. I visit 2-4 times a year and always stop in . The room was always cleaned towels were never a issue.  Weekend a little crowded but weekdays are perfect if your not into crowds.
50,Avery nice resort  perfect location.    Easy ascess to other resorts and casinos. Restaurants stores .  Shows. Rates are very fare.    Nice swimming pool. Carrot Top is there. You have to check him out.  All very reasonable
50,From the time I arrived my stay was amazing start to finish. The service was 2nd to none and the staff was great. My room had an amazing view and was very clean. Housekeeping really goes out of there way to clean.
10,You’d think with their app that checking in using the elevators and exiting parking would be a piece of cake. You’d be dead wrong. The elevators do not recognize the digital codes well and it’s frustrating when you just want to get to your floor and it won’t allow it. I expected a relaxing getaway and what I got was a stressful aggravating experience!
50,Luxor was comfortable! It was my first time staying there and it was nice! I will definitely stay again in the future! I will definitely recommend to my friends and family! Service was great! Everything was great!
40,The hotel was great a lot of places to go to. Not to close to middle of strip but close enough to everything around the area. The only thing was had a mobile key but that didn’t work had to go and get an actual key
10,we were disappointed it was out anniversary we checked in at 2:30am and the front desk mananger didnt have our room ready he said it was alreasy given to someone else and they put us in a room which was two queens
40,We went down for a show and stayed at the Luxor. Enjoyed Blue Man Group and the Titanic & Bodies Exhibits. Despite a booking error on my part the staff was friendly and helped me get the correct set up and made sure the financial impact was as small as possible.
40,App failed to work at check in as promised. No need to wait in long lines get your digital key and right to your room. Staff helped out with the keycard only to write the wrong number down to the room. Next staff member said it was the right room without checking. Took a phone call to the service desk to verify who I was and that it was the wrong number written down and then I was giving the right room number
30,This place just needs better amenities and some updating. Otherwise it was pretty decent for the price.    More food options would be nice. Need mini bars in the rooms or at least in the suites. Room service would have been really nice.
50,It was my first time staying at the Luxor and it did not smell like a Snoop Dogg video at all compared to where I had stayed previously when I went to Vegas  .. the spa was amazing I recommended and the staff was so nice.
50,Great hotel to stay at. The staff here are very helpful and courteous. Shows here are awesome. The rooms are really nice and the beds are very comfortble. The restaurants are really great to eat at and have a few drinks.
30,Rooms definitely need updated on everything. The best part of our room was the jacuzzi tub. The bed was not comfy. It was missing a lot of stuff and could be better. The tvs are blurry and their weren’t any cell phone charging ports the fridge didn’t keep anything cold the fan in bathroom was not operable or didn’t have any no full size mirror in our room and no microwave or coffee.
30,Employees could be more helpful and nicer  Front desk Employees tell you to make your keys over there then point  When you get over there you and other guests are trying to figure how to make room keys  Next Employees tell you over there when you need help over there
50,Everyone was super helpful and the facility was very affordable. The pizza in between the Luxor and Mandalay Bay was amazing!! There wasn’t a single question not answered by all the staff we came in contact with.
50,I will always love the Luxor.. it still has the old time Vegas hospitality and I will always be back. The staff was amazing housekeeping was so nice to me. The room was nice and they upgraded me to a suite.
30,no mini fridge in room. no explanation of anything. location is at the end of the strip. no being asked for cocktails during casino play. early check in price but not 100% guaranteed and you won’t know until you try to check in.
50,Haven't been on a family trip for a long time and this was an excellent getaway. We all needed this and the staff here made us feel very welcome. The rooms had an incredible view and were very clean. My family and I would definitely come back!
40,The hotel was nice we stayed in the tower side ! Just a fridge would be nice to keep everything cold. Definitely bring a cooler! The staff was very friendly! You can’t use your rewards to buy stuff at Starbucks and the cups are really cute so make room in your suitcase for them!!
30,Check in was a pain. The elevators in the pyramid are sketchy at best. Buttons for floors dont work properly. Sometimes took you to the wrong floor. It was a running joke with many guest about what fun the elevator would provide. They also have removed mini fridge from rooms probably so you have to buy very expensive things from the 24/7 store. Also shower did not have a door so you got to be cold as well as wet the whole floor while showering.
30,Fam's first time staying at Luxor.  We were unable to reached front desk prior to check-in on hold for over 30 mins twice and no answer. Saw old trash bags full of trash outside my room not sure if housekeeping saw those because of its location. Hallway has okd carpeting. Other than these my experience with Luxor was awesome. Has a very nice pool that closes early at 6PM 24hr Fitness Center gives almost 25% military discount at any luxor stores great room rates and free parking for military families. This is an older hotel and casino...keep that in mind.
30,Large casino rooms outdated ant problem.  Signage not helpful I got lost trying to find my room.. The tv was grainy.  The Starbucks and after hours cafe was good..  The lobby Is really nice and it makes for great pictures.
20,Spend the money. Go somewhere else. This place needs a top to.bottom overhaul. Everything about this hotel screams “I’m tired and old and need a facelift” the elevators are shaky as hell. The rooms have that old sour smell. The room keys only worked about half the times. Fewer on the elevators.
50,It was clean and great the service was good everyone from the staff too the valet parking was no problem I was in and out with no worries. The app for my mgm was clutch for checking in and checking out
50,Bed was big and comfortable. Room was spacious and newly renovated. The only complaint I have is the shower door is half a door water would go everywhere. For the price it was great! We’ve stayed at other “low budget” hotels and we were not impressed but I really was happy with Luxor. We also did Mobil check in with a room key on our phones and it was the easiest process ever. When we arrived the line was wrapped around to the gaming floor. We had early check in and the room was ready the second we walked into the hotel. With Mobil check in we skipped the line and went right to the room. The room was missing a hairdryer I called housekeeping and one was brought right up to us. Thank you Luxor for the easy fun stay!
50,It was an amazing places to stay in I enjoy my stay especially because it was my birthday the home buffet it was amazing  The hotel in general is very clean and spot on too  The staff is very helpful too
50,Great service in every area with staffing. The room was great too! Hopefully next time I’ll get a Suite . I wanted a bigger room but it was still good ! Looking forward to my next trip to stay at Mandalay or Luxor
10,Mold- water damage on fridge shelf. Crumbs on couch. No water last day. No wifi to mobile check in. All for a high dollar suite. Pretty disturbing what I had to deal with and will never stay at this property again.
10,We found trash left in our room including a dirty sock on the floor a container of small white pills that looks suspicious and concerning. We flushed them down the toilet. In the fridge we found moldy food. We brought these concerns to the front desk and the woman there was rude and offered no apology or resolution. Really grips.
50,Luxor is a great place to visit for it's unique theme nice shows and nicely remodeled rooms. The only con I had was I wasn't aware the different towers used different key cards which was my mistake. The checking in lines could definitely use some help when there's around 100 people in line and I never seen an option for food service delivery to room. Other than that I absolutely loved my stay and would definitely recommend to people.
10,The hotel is showing its age and our initially assigned room was musky and humid and gross. It’s not worth the price. Other guests also had difficult experiences including issues with parking passes and elevator malfunctions.
50,Nice room! Didn’t smell like smoke like the hotels near by. Restaurants near by and in the hotel are good! I would definitely recommend and stay here again.  Great location in the strip and around everything for walking or Uber distance.
40,We stayed her for 5 nights and found it to be a great hotel for the price. Diablo's Cantina was very good and both Johnny Rockets and the Pizza place in the Food Court are open late. Nice size room and the bed was comfortable. High wind so the Pool was kinda hit and miss during our stay. We also saw Fantasy which was MUCH better than we anticipated. The Titanic exhibit is also a must see we would definitely stay here again.
20,The check-in process was miserable. The MGM app was very little help. Stayed in a King Corner Suite which had an in-room hot tub but no jets. The windows whistled loudly when the wind blew outside... There was zero sound insulation from the hallway outside the room. Never received a receipt for my stay after checkout.
10,There is so many places to stay on the strip. I have stayed in Vegas 20x now. This was my first time at the Luxor and I will not be back. Terrible management slow service and they charged things to my room that I did not do/purchase. Overall worst Vegas experience. I know I will be back just not to the Luxor.
50,We were surprised at how nice the rooms were at the Luxor. It cost less than the MGM Grand but the rooms were better. The elevators were quick and the walk from the parking garage was not as far as at the MGM Grand.
50,Excellent customer service. Will definitely come back again. Friendly staff. Wish there were more 25 cent wheel of fortune games. Housekeeping services excellent and friendly. Room was nice and clean. Recommend free valet and self parking for veterans
20,Bathroom had trash and hair in multiple places on the vanity from prior guest. Rooms are dated. Mattress was sunk in at the middle and needs to be replaced. Shower design is bad. No door and water all over the floor. AC would not keep working. Shut off every night despite tuning down to the thermostat to lowest setting. Actually witnessed a dog in the casino pooping on the carpet next to the elevator. Would not recommend.
50,Luxor Hotel and Casino is Wonderful and has Excellent Hotel and Casino Staff providing excellent Guest Services since they really care about your experience. I enjoyed my first time stay only being one night and looking forward to staying again at the Luxor Hotel and Casino real soon with my Family. Thank You !
50,Great experience. Luxor posititioned to allow access to various hotels casinos malls and the activity of the Strip. Good to have access to hot food upon late arrival. Service between airport great about a 15 minute strech when using taxi.
50,A wonderful weekend and everyone was super friendly and amazing. Not one bad experience at the Luxor. Will gladly go back and recommend. We enjoyed everything while we stayed. The pool and the restaurant’s where all amazing. Can’t wait to go back.
40,Our stay at the Luxor was predicated on value (low priced room) while taking a chance on the room being acceptable. We received exactly what we bargained for. A good room at a great value. The rest of the f the casino and hotel was as advertised — good dining with a good gambling experience
50,Luxor has always treated our family very well. Tender steakhouse is one of my favorite places to eat on the strip. I would highly recommend staying at the luxor casino. Good location very easy parking and fast check in.
30,The Luxor is a beautiful property. However if you can stay somewhere else that would be my suggestion. If I was visiting for the afternoon and did not stay here I would have enjoyed it more. The breakfast buffet was outstanding. Hands down saved the experience for me.
10,While eating breakfast at the pyramid cafe a lady in an out of control mobility scooter rammed my 2 year old son numerous times. Numerous injuries very traumatic. No help from Luxor. It was a scooter rented from the luxor happened on luxor property. Stay far away from this dangerous facility.
30,Our stay at the Luxor was decent. The digital key in the app was mostly the only issue. It’s useless you’re better off getting a hard copy of the key. Other than that it was a decent stay. No major issues.
40,This was my first visit in many years to the Luxor Resort. It was our go to Vegas spot years ago.    Here are the pros of my recent visit:    The overall cleanliness of the resort was great. It felt clean and safe.  The staff was pleasant helpful and accommodating.  The ample food establishments were good and a nice variety.  The room was clean and our request for an early check-in was affordable and accepted.  Good variety on the gaming floor. Slots and tables.  Easy access out to the strip.  Easy access to the MGM tram; Excalibur and Mandalay Bay.  Comfortable beds.  Spacious Rooms.  Affordable.    Cons:  The room was paper thin. We were near a main thoroughfare and man it seemed like a gathering point for several large (loud) groups. It aslo seemed as if there were about 50 people staying in the room next door.
50,Our stay here was exceptional due to the friendly staff close proximity of amenities and overall experience. We did have a couple hiccups on our trip but I’m confident our host Frank will get them resolved. We’ve already planned our next trip back and can’t wait to see how our next experience will be.
40,"Not one lettuce leaf found. In house food court and buffet all fast foods and greasy. Liked BBQ Mexicano which is ""next door"" in the Mandalay food court. If you want something healthy you will have to find something off the strip."
50,Golf gaming fellowship..NFL draft experience on the strip was amazing Public House has the best staff wings and TVs are amazing…Blue Man Troupe was sold out agin “darn” will get to next time Fantasy show is on the top of the list to see as well. Hotel location to airport is wonderful and connection to Mandalay Bay hotel is a bonus. Foundation Room at Mandalay Bay is to die for..
40,Good location top of the strip very clean nice atmosphere  Check-in queues are terrible  Stayed in the Tower which ws very quiet spacious room cleaned every day  Food in The Public House was very good  Blue Man Group show excellent  Pool area nice but be aware if you want a shaded area/umbrella you need to pay extra
40,We booked this ages ago and got a great price a little over $400 for a 4 night stay. Its spotlessly clean and has great facilities stunning looking building massive place and easy to get lost in. Its a bit of a walk to the strip but if you have moderate fitness/mobility its not a big problem. Rooms are big and housekeeping staff do a good job. Place is let down by the check in experience. Massive queue with only 4 staff at the desk. We tried to check in via the app but its so bad it couldn’t capture the picture of our passports so we had to wait nearly an hour to check in manually. Then the staff member continued to have a conversation with his colleague while checking us in missing out on giving us key information like how the parking garage worked. We paid each time we left the garage using the tickets in the machine but only discovered on checkout that we should have used our room key. We then were also charged per day for parking on our bill. Luckily we were able to dispute this and get it waived. But it’s something we should have been told.  Also parts of the pool and jacuzzi were roped off during our stay and on one of the days a DJ was playing so loud we couldnt have a conversation. Not very relaxing at all
30,I would recommend the casino but NOT the hotel rooms. Very outdated. Bed was too hard. Room had a musty smell. I was only there for one night so didn't bother trying to switch rooms. Go gamble in the casino but sleep somewhere else.
40,Friendly just bad service/wifi in room. Everything was near the stadium for the bts concert. Rooms were very comfortable and food was convenient inside the hotel. (Food court as well) Also walk way to other hotels.
50,Great overall experience! Staff was friendly and helpful resort was very well kept shows were awesome and all of the food was amazing!! Juat like the rest of the MGM properties this one was great! We will definitely be back!
50,I was very happy with the accommodations at the Luxor. The food was good from the buffet as well as the little cafe. The rooms were clean and comfortable. The casino had a variety of games. I like the 24/7 shop too.
10,Spend your money and time elsewhere . The elevators have loose hardware and are half the time never work . The price for the food and bev is on par with way nicer hotels . Stay there instead . Also on the far side of the strip now
50,Close to everything and gives you access via the tram to either Excalibur or Mandalay bay. It is kid and family friendly. The pools and shows are amazing. This place will not disappoint. Early check-in was easy.
10,Not a good experience. Room had rotten food locked in the room safe. Took maintenance 2 days to come to open it. Upon which the rotten food was found. Stayed in the staywell room and didn’t feel like the room was cleaned completely.
40,I had a very good experience when I was there the staff were very professional and helpful the rooms are cleaned every day and if you have a problem they try very hard to to help you fix it and the food was pretty good
50,I have stayed at the Luxor before and every time I go the people who work there are absolutely fabulous.  I was there just a couple of weeks ago and again the entire casino at the hotel the restaurant the crew all fabulous.The casino itself is kept very clean. The air conditioner works really well because a lot of people don’t smoke anymore so there wasn’t too much smoke in the area. My room was immaculate. The counter personnel that helped me was literally out of this world he was awesome. I recommend them completely I love that place.
40,Everything was adequate. Enjoyed stay. Glasses by ice bucket dirty lipstick and smudges. Bad impression.  Took my own coffee maker and styrofoam cups. No mini fridge either. Knew exactly what I was getting before I went. Wanted room in pyramid for the experience that's what I booked. Pyramid rooms full when I arrived got upgraded?? to East tower didn't feel like upgrade. They just didn't plan properly for my reservation.  All okay with a little flexibility  Nice place to stay for the price.
10,I needed help with security they looked at me like I was crazy I pointed at the problem and they were just stuck on stupid talking with other security Terri le never again staying here check in was the worst
50,Amazing! Well where do I start. This is both me and my partners 4th time in Las Vegas from Ireland and we love it. We consider it our second home. We arrived at reception to be welcomed by a very friendly and helpful young man on the desk he was very friendly chatty and engaged with us. We were also upgraded to a suite complementary as it was for a special occasion that was interrupted last year due to covid and we finally got away this year. We then got to the room and it was incredible. The massive room which was just on the corner of the pyramid had a long room with a bath just under the window overlooking the stars. Breathtaking!  We also had a separate sitting room with a sofa fridge and tv. Again with a window overlooking the sky and strip.  Vegas never disappoints and neither does the Luxor. Fantastic hotel and amazing location.
30,Getting to our floor was ridiculous. The elevators are the worst. You have to scan your key to get to your floor. It wouldn't t be a problem if it actually worked the first time instead it takes you for ride to mutiple floors until you get your key to scan and press your floor number.
30,For the price we paid I did not feel the room was worth it. In Vegas you really only need a room for a place to sleep paying $300 for an out of date fridgeless stinky dark room is not necessary. The hotel itself was nice. The lobby and food options were great!
50,I picked the hotel for the unique design which was the best choice I could have made. Great building design with a unique elevator. The staff was SUPER FRIENDLY. 24/7 activities with great exhibits. The casino was busy and kept clean.
40,Cool spot to take in with nice atmosphere! I just think they need to upgrade the room and improve the tv reception in the room.    Overall staff is on point from front desk housekeeping and luggage! Thanks
30,Place okat check in no body knew it the buffet was open  They didn’t split the 2 rooms that I book for us and our friends so checking out we had to stand in the check in-line to fix bill  Rugs need to be tightened in the room hallways
40,Things were going well until we arrived and discovered that we could’ve checked in much earlier than 3 PM. Some employee was asking people in line if they wanted a “free” upgrade but seem to be very particular who they offered it to.
30,I would say the Luxor it’s a Cool hotel to stay at for one time stay unless you get discounts for room rates. There was a extremely excessive long wait time for “Check In’s” & “Check Out’s” (witnessed a lot of upset people). The hotel hallway are very out dated & people kept stealing our “Do Not Disturb” sign (we ended up getting it back). Also the shower sprays to much water out from the glass wall which is flaw in the shower design. I believe the hotel rooms should at least have a mini fridge & small microwave(maybe). I saw a lot of people bringing small ice chest for that reason. The Luxor is cool looking hotel but really need to update the hallways remove the pop corn ceiling and add a mini fridge to make me feel like my $700 stay was worth it.
20,These guys dont have water bottles in hotel room. They gave wrong room and i have to walk back with all my baggage to reception to solve it. Where reception is very far. Too bad hotel. Just building looks good
50,I stayed for 4 days at the luxor. From the time I walked thru the doors the staff both front desk and others help me get to my room and enjoy my 4days and 3 nights they help me locate shows that I wanted to attend. I will be back
10,I was watching television when I heard someone enter my room with a key card before exiting before I could see them. I called the front desk and they told me to wait for security to come. I waited about 30 minutes inlcuding after going down to the front desk to wait for them. They switched my room key cards but the customer service numbers they gave me ended up hanging up on me. So I just walked around the hotel warning people for the rest of my stay. Too bad MGM keeps buying hotels on the strip makes it harder to avoid staying there.
30,It was ok nothing super memorable but not the worst thing in the world. You get what you pay for I guess. It’s all the way at one end of the strip which was not ideal. I thought with the design of the building this would have been a really cool experience. I will say I enjoyed the Pyramid cafe staff but would love more menu options.
50,We had a great time the restaurants in the hotel where great atmosphere was good and I enjoyed myself. A few of my friends it was there first time in Vegas and there first stay at the Luxor and we all enjoyed it!!
40,We arrived early and inquired about early check in. The lady at the front desk couldn’t even check us in said the system wouldn’t allow it which I found odd because I was able to check in online as soon as I walked away. Bell services was busy and very long line so we put our bags back in our car. We went to eat and after a while we did receive a message that our room was ready. Good thing we did online check in because the front desk was crazy for the rest of the day and the lobby was chaotic. Room was clean beds were comfy these rooms are a little dated. There’s no mini fridge in the room just a empty cabinet where one should be which would have been nice to keep waters cold. I think my biggest complaint would have to be the half shower door. Weird design and water gets on the floor. But over all we really enjoyed our stay.
10,We won’t be staying here again crappy experience! Check in is always a problem you’ve had months to fix this but haven’t these reviews are a waste of my time as I know nothing will change at this property.
50,Huge Pyramid Premuim Room with great views down Strip. Plenty of eating and drink venues. Easy access to both Mandalay Bay and Excalibur. If booking independently sign up for MGM Rewards to get offers and discounts. At North end of Strip so quite distance from central areas but plenty of taxis and only about 15 dollars one way. Cab fare from airport set at 20 dollars
10,Front desk asked for my credit card at check-in and said Luxor will authorize a $50 refundable security deposit hold. An hour later I get notified by my bank that Luxor front desk has charged my card for $60
50,Loved the room and the hotel I can’t wait to come back in a few months the food was great the stay was amazing and not just that the experience was so unreal still can’t get it wrapped around my head!
40,Luxor is one of several MGM properties in Vegas. It was my first time visiting the city and I couldn't have been more happy with my stay there. The room was clean and quiet and the hotel has plenty of food and beverage options. It's also connected to the Shoppes of Mandalay Bay which has great options for restaurants and shops. I would strongly encourage anyone staying there to use the MGM app to check in. The registration desk line was always long. No less than 20-30 people waiting at a time. I'd definitely stay here again if I ever return to Vegas.
40,My family checked in and it was very clean. We stayed so far down the strip because my girls wanted to watch BTS at Alleigant Stadium. The rest of my family had the best time staying close to them to watch the Blue Man Group dinner at Diablo Cantina Michael Jackson the casino and Fat Tuesday basically being in the hotel. Great location if you don't want to travel far to do exciting things!
20,Bathroom sink was clogged I had to take stopper out to be able to let water out. There are a bug running I saw in the bathroom while I was having morning shower. Told front desk agent while checking out she did not care my experience.
50,We had lots of fun. We are planning to have more vacations stay at Luxur. The Luxur hotel and casino gave us much joy because we where able to get in the pool. The food is excellent and kids really liked it.
50,Great location for us. We like to gamble at southpoint and Silverton as well as the strip. The tram can take us down the strip and by car we can go to the other resorts. Lots and lots of things to do and places to eat. Great access to Mandalay Bay. Parking was free with pearl card. Rooms were unique and different.
50,Stayed at the luxor (bts themed room) for the 2nd weekend loved how close it was to the stadium and just overall worth the stay. considering it being my first trip with my sisters without our parents we felt safe and had a wonderful time <3
10,Room smelled like sewer and there was mold in the shower the check in process was a nightmare no one knew what they were doing making this experience at the luxor a nightmare will not be returning to this location
40,We stayed here for BTS and had the best time. It was right between Allegiant (Raider) Stadium and the MGM and it was super easy walking to  the events even with a 7YO. The city closed down the bridge to the stadium which helps a lot. Our 7YO loved the pool too even with the DJ pumping the bass. One of our favorite memories was the casino DJ playing BTS after the concert to extend the afterglow. We did miss internet TV with YouTube Netflix etc. and room service but it’s not bad to have a reason to get out of the room and explore/adventure. Also be sure to use the MGM app to get your garage pass and room key in advance. So convenient to skip the lines after the long drive up the 15!
10,Was extremely overcharged from posted rates for a 2 day stay. front desk was difficult to reach and rude when I finally did . Housekeeping walked in on my not once but twice  even though I had paid extra for late checkout . Bathroom drain was super slow and flooded the already dirty bathroom .
20,Room was not well kept. Constantly calling for towels that never came. When I checked in the facility charged my card $600 I was told $200 deposit was included in that. Good thing I have my card on pause when I’m not using because they kept trying to charge me an additional $475 before I checked out and the employees gave me a generic response saying how it was an error in the system.! Just really uncomfortable
50,My first visit to Vegas was EVERYTHING EXCELLENT ❤️The rooms were very neat and clean. Friendly staff drinks were awesome and the hotel has very attention to detail with the design and interior decor. My fav was the souvenir cup of the Luxor triangle with the flashing tower light
20,Overall unsatisfactory trip. All the guests in our party won't be staying here again. Dirty on the exterior and in elevators rooms are dated no Wi-Fi service in your rooms the digital key on your phone doesn't work and some showers don't have doors. Luxor is like a cheap motel with a casino in it.
20,Housekeeping sucks i call twice to have my room clean when i was away and nobody showed up four days we were there and the only thing they left us was clean towels terrible service also there was somebody drilling something on the room next door at 7am.
50,One big big issue. I lived in the west tower everything there was great. But the elevators in east tower were horrifying. Literally every of them SHAKED (and huge shakes). To the extent I felt I would fall and die in any second when I was in the elevator. Those elevators really need to be changed. They are too old!
20,Poor service. Room not clean when checked it. Sheets not changed. No water a pipe burst. Other charges on credit card that were not authorized. Sent email to hotel of complaints but no response after 3 days. Have always stayed there but will not return
40,Some others have said the Luxor isn’t all that great so my expectations were low but I was pleasantly surprised. The room was large and clean. Whenever we needed anything it was brought to the room in a timely manner. Over all the hotel is a bit dated but it was very clean and tidy. What more do you need!?
10,Throw up from another guest left by elevators for 3 hours! Previous guest hair not cleaned from shower or bedding. Do not stay here! Overpriced Motel 8. Stay away from the Luxor! Bad terrible & disgusting!
20,Paid for early checkin and was using app still had to go and wait in line to get checked in. when we got to our room you could tell that it was not cleaned very well. There was someones belt on the floor we only had 2 towels no floor mat and the shower was dirty. From the casino perspective we were told we didn't need a physical rewards card beause we had the app however there was no way to enter our code into the tables or slot machines. My husband played one of the tables from 10pm-7am the next day and none of that was accounted for. We were told that we were getting $30 a day for food but could not find anyone who could the us how to do this. The Fantasy show was great and felt it was worth the money. All seats had a great view. the tram was great to use between Mandala Bay and Ecalibur.
50,Beautiful hotel. The suite room was great! Very spacious and helpful staff! There was plenty of room on the casino floor to navigate and be at a distance for health concerns. Very convenient hotel area as you can travel to a few different hotels within a sort distance. The room service was great! The staffs at the hotel were friendly and very helpful. A would recommend to many friends and families! Looking forward to a few more stays in the future.
10,Won't ever stay there again! The room had a old mold smell as well as mold in ceiling it was always hot and muggy dirty carpet shower door broken. A very unsatisfied stay and not worth the money at all.
40,Check in was efficient first room given was the very opposite end from the pool (main reason for staying there) but staff handled the swap for us efficiently. Had to rent room fridge but $25 for a week was ok. Pool area was nice lots of free chairs. Pool drinks were prohibitive with a large pina colada at the mid $30 range. Just seems a bit too much of a cash grab. Never got to visit the buffet either closed or hours posted incorrectly same was happening all over Vegas. Fun trip but Vegas has lost its lustre as an inexpensive escape and having been going since the late ‘80’s it is a shame. Go see Carrot Top hilarious.
50,The rooms were clean the people were nice only problem I had he is when they quote you a price for your room they don't tell you about the holding fees until you get there where I'm from there's a $50 holding fee at MGM Casino and they let you know up front when you are booking a room but there is a $200 holding fee there and every one is not from Vegas so it should be mentioned when they are quoting you a price and not just ask you to put a card on file to hold the room and you will not be charged but hit you with that fee when you check in
50,This was a pleasure trip  with family  where my sister also got married on Monday after a busy  busy weekend. I hope we can get back to the Luxor soon  no one in our family had a single complaint. Thank you Luxor  and all your staff for a job well done
40,Everything was great but I didn’t have a fridge microwave the tv had no channels and no way to link phone to watch movies since there was no channels. The staff were great and nice so was the process of checking in.
20,Lots of its of debris on the floor and carpet area around bed. Felt dirty like it hadn't been vacuumed since the last people who stayed maybe longer. We booked weeks ago through MGM Rewards and asked for a high floor and we ended up with a 1st floor room. The sink also was plugged in the bathroom and wouldn't drain. If you brushed your teeth it would nearly fill and take 15 minutes to empty. Also we ate breakfast on our last day in the Pyramid Cafe. We ordered 3 omlettes and 2 glasses of orange juice. The bill was $78. No such thing as a cheap meal in Vegas anymore.
50,Hotel was clean staff friendly food was good. Quick easy check in and out. Efficient baggage holding. Great valet getting taxis for guests. Plenty to do. Loved the tram and easy walkways between hotels.
20,The hotel stinks really bad when you walk in. The rooms needs to be updated. The prices in the pyramid cafe was way to expensive and the food was nasty. I would not recommend this casino and I would not stay here again!
50,Really enjoyed my stay all the staff was super helpful and friendly I’m already planning my next trip with you guys I highly recommend this hotel for everyone and it’s right on the strip so you’ve got a bunch of stuff to do around the hotel
20,First room had cockroaches second room AC didn’t keep accurate temperature elevators stopped working for a time so I ended up taking the stairs down 16 flights the water was shut off during our stay and we had to use our own bottles water to brush our teeth or wash our hands after being in the casino. I was disappointed overall with our stay I was happy to check out.
30,You can't beat the location. We stayed in the Pyramid which could use some updating. Cell service was horrible in our room and the wi-fi was spotty at best. There is no longer room service which would have been amazing.
40,I stayed at the Luxor for 5 nights/6 days while in town for a tattoo appointment and a few shows. Overall my stay at Luxor was without issue. Some positives include:  - Mobile check in room key and check out in MGM app meant I was able to entirely avoid the registration line.  - Easily accessible charge summary in MGM app made it quick and simple to review charges and there were no mystery charges at check out.  - Even though the casino level was smoky there was no smoke odor in my room whatsoever.  - Room was clean and linens/towels were fresh. No funky stains or odors anywhere.    A few minor issues that I ran into:  - I stayed in a pyramid room and the AC was not strong enough to keep room cool with curtains open. With curtains closed the room was perfect temp.  - Water pressure in the shower was fantastic but the half door meant that the bathroom floor got soaked within minutes of starting the shower. Even with 2 bath mats down they were sopping wet after a ~5 minute shower.    Luxor is obviously at the south end of the strip so I did quite a bit of walking but I found it quite pleasant given the amount of pathways through casinos/hotels. I was expecting to put some miles in so I didn’t mind the location at all. It was nice to be in a slightly quieter location than the mid-strip hotels provide. In terms of cost to experience ratio I would absolutely be willing to stay at Luxor again.
10,Carrying luggage from parade over street past three swimming pool then through the entire casino is very inconvenient a shuttle would alleviate a lot of frustration and pain.  There wasn’t even anyone along the way to ask if you were headed in the right direction.
50,This location was perfect for venues at the Allegiant Stadium as it was a short walk across the Hacienda Bridge (bridge is located between Luxor and MGM. Includes a 24 hour deli. Be prepared for elevators that move sideways!
20,I had heard that the customer service in the USA was the best there is. Someone needs to tell that to the check in staff at this hotel. Spectacular looking from the outside but inside the check in staff were very rude. The person who deal with us shouted at us twice and when we complained to the manager he did not care one bit. There were 5 of us in our party split into two rooms. We knew we would not get rooms near each other but the lady on check in told us we were only one floor between us. Turned out we were on floor 19 and the other two people were on floor 4. 15 floors difference. We complained to the manager who manged to get us on the same floor but completely ignored the fact the lady had been very rude to us. Hey ho we thought we are in Vegas. Unfortunately this was not the only issue as the cleaning team seemed to absent as well. Still this aside what a magnificent place. Just remember to take plenty of money as the food and drink in the Luxor is far more expensive than the neighbouring Mandaly Bay and Excalibur.
40,MGM with all of their locations and connecting walk ways provides a variety of things to do and choose from. Luxor - Blue Man group is awesome. New York New york outside walk way and park was great. And Excalibur food court had a wonderful selection.
30,Check in staff was a bit rude. Made me wait 5-6 hours for a room but we’re giving people who checked in after us a room as soon as they checked in. It’s an okay hotel but really wouldn’t recommend it.
50,I highly recommend this hotel. It was clean lots of things to do excellent customer service. It was a great experience for my daughter and I. All staff that I spoke to was very friendly. The location is excellent if attending an event at the Allegiant Stadium. It is walking distance.
40,We did a trip to Vegas for my 28th birthday and my husband and I 9 year anniversary. We enjoyed our stay at the Luxor. The gambling was on the poor side but the food and room was great. Definitely plan on staying again.
20,Poor suite. Lack of hot water. Casino running on limited number of staff. Impossible to contact the front desk. This was the first trip to Las Vegas for us in three years due to illness and will be our last to the Luxor.
20,This old place is in serious need of updating the rooms in the pyramid. Our upgraded room was over priced very sparse and the shower leaked.  When I mentioned this to staff they did nothing. I would not stay here again.
30,Be ready to wait in line! Key cards didn't work for parking and only half the time with the elevators. Very unorganized hotel. Some employees are rude. Housekeeping is sweet but rooms could be cleaner.
20,Hotel itself is nice and clean but the room service is terrible. Easy mobile check in but digital key won’t work all the time AC in the room soooo noisy and hard to control temperature hassle to close the blinds. Worst part is cleaning checked in on Sunday only on Tuesday after calling for room service the came to clean but no vacuuming no bathroom cleaning… on Wednesday the wet face towels were left folded so not sure if used ones were folded back just left on that day even though we had it till Thursday.
50,Over all was very pleased with my stay value and location was easy access to other casinos with the tram.lots of shops for souvenirs and the places to eat were endless. I can’t think of anything negative about my stay at the Luxor
50,The east tower had good sound proofing nice windows a good view and it was spacious and clean. The AC was nice and cold and the tub in the bathroom was big. We also like the party tram to Mandalay Bay and Excalibur.
30,Bathroom fan not functioning so the room was constantly steamed up. The toilets do not flush all contents down. All toilet paper or other contents at the front of the toilet just stay there unless you physically push it into the water area
10,I have stayed at the Luxor about 3 times now. Twice this year alone. This trip was going great until the night before my checkout. I arrived back to my room from working to get ready for an evening out when my key card wont open my room. It was rather odd but I thought it a fluke and went to the front desk to get a new card. When I got to the front I was told they left a message for me and was asked if I received it. THEY LEFT A MESSAGE ON A PHONE IN A ROOM THEY LOCKED ME OUT OF! I said no and was told to wait the first girl left and came back said there was a billing issue and I was to wait there. I waited for upward of 10 minutes and the lady who came over did not have any empathy and she was clearly corporate trained. She followed her training perfectly to harass me for payment until I gave in and paid. The next day they then tried to take the money they just harassed me for out of the account they claimed didn't work. What is worse is the girl that was harassing me was continuously giggling and asking me to repeat information she clearly had. I will never be staying at the Luxor or any MGM property every again. I was harassed and publicly embarrassed over an issue on their end. Locked out of my room no where to stay with my dogs separated from me.
40,It was good more than I thought if weekday price. Not worth more than $250/a night .    Room was clean .Elevator wasn’t busy.  I wanted mini fridge in the room tho.    Check-in was long line around 4pm.the front desk lady was nice even if I’m not English speaker.thank you!
20,I had to be moved due to a very young family put into the adjoining room. The children were allowed to run up and down the corridor screaming and trying all the room door. When in room there was constant screaming banging on adjoining door and for some reason the hairdryer was on constantly. Then been threatened by the mothers for pleading with them to let me nap.  After having no sleep I could not keep my eyes open on the Grand canyon tour which cost a lot of money.  The room was dusty the view was the back wall of hotel looking and listening to the drumming of the air con out side. My feet were filthy from the carpet  I was not happy at having to pay $35 per day resort fees and can not find any where to complain. Wish the LUXOR well but I for one will not return to Las Vegas as I felt ripped off.
30,Lines were always long and Luxor employees were rude and impatient. Simple requests took awhile to resolve because you always had to wait in long lines. I had to make two reports to get a very loose toilet seat tighten.
50,Perfect location for walking to Allegiant Stadium. Staff very helpful and quick to assist solo traveler. Easy to navigate between MGM resorts using monorail. Downloading app made checkin and checkout extremely easy!
10,Terrible check in process rooms are old and dirty. Staff isn’t friendly. Luxor is still a more expensive hotel. Take your money elsewhere and have a better experience. Paid for a suite that could sleep 4. It could only sleep 2 and they made us rent an extra bed.
40,If you get to go to Vegas during a dust storm event just hope you get to stay at the Luxor. The winds where 35 - 50 mph very dusty sky’s we felt snug as a bug in our little room on the 8th floor starting at the palms waving in the wind. As evening fell the winds keep their persistents and the small gaps in the window frames sang us to sleep. We had friends on the 13th floor the 15th floor and the 19th floor and eel hen we wanted to go visit we had to take the stairs… the inclinatiors refused to take us beyond the 8th floor. So we had to hike up many flights of stairs…  The hotel is surprisingly quiet for its open floor plan we could look right down and see folks but we could not hear them.
10,I booked the room for the BTS ARMY experience. I was on the BTS room website and it asked for my MGM rewards. I put the number in not knowing that I just switched my room from the BTS room to the rewards room. I was given no prompt. The hotel refused to help me. The BTS room was the only reason I went to stay there. I already had a great hotel somewhere else. It took 6 desk people and 4 managers to finally answer my question. If I booked my room on the BTS room page how did I wind up with a rewards room? The answer: I put my rewards number in. Always read the fine print. BOO MGM! You dampened my BTS experience. No one would make this right. Even by showing my history on my phone. It shows I was booking on the right page. Nothing you can do? Okay. I'll warn others of what feels like deceitful treatment.
10,This use to be a nice place to stay but it is now rundown and more like a trailer park compared to the other surrounding hotels. Check in line was at least 30 minute wait and the express check in app is horrible. No directions to where your room is at and when they have several different towers outside of the main pyramid it is confusing. Paid $30 extra to have checkout at 3pm and at exactly 1pm knocked on the door and opened it at the same time. Never had a chance to respond to them and they never announced who it was. It was the maid she opens the door and says “you staying over” I said we have late checkout at 3pm. She said “oh nobody told me”. Seriously? Like everything is by computer I doubt anyone tells anyone anything they check their electronic device. The do not disturb sign on doors here mean nothing. If I would have been standing by that door when it swung open I would have instinctively knocked her out. I cant believe a maid would open a door without saying housekeeping or giving the occupants time to respond to the knock. She knocked while opening the door. Now that I know this is a ghetto hotel I will never stay here again. It use to be very nice. Problems like this stem from the top. The CEO should be replaced and the East tower needs to be remodeled. They don’t even have refrigerators in the suites.
40,If you are here for an event at the stadium it's a 5-10 min walk to the stadium. You can take the tram to Mandalay and follow the sign to the stadium. Foodcourt opens late if you need to grab a bite.The 2-queen room is clean and spacious. Staff is friendly.
20,This hotel works if you just need a place to sleep and not looking anything more. I couldn't get service at the restaurant after waiting 10 mins but the overall property is decent. I was also locked out of my room for an hour waiting on security. Which is a huge red flag as a single woman traveling alone for business.
20,We stay at Luxor almost every time we go to Las Vegas this past weekend will be the last time. The room was nice and clean but the entire resort was filthy. Full trash cans busted elevators slot machines were not cleaned and had cigarette ashes and butts all over them homeless everywhere in the mornings sleeping at machines Centra Bar machines were not cleaned E Sports Arena had several issues and our son was unable to play anything. I always thought Luxor was a good budget property but after this weekend I'm not sure what you would call it almost slummy. We stayed there this past November and it wasn't this bad I don't know what happened over such a short time but it was very sad.
50,Come every year for the Open Championship bowling tournament we stay at the Luxor always clean and very nice staff. When we are able to take advantage of the pool this area is awesome! Love that I get complimentary night free play at the casino and Resort credit.
20,This is a very tired hotel in urgent need of refurbishment with very poor facilities even by Las Vegas standards. It’s alo at one end of the Strip so a lot of the best things to see (and there’s not a lot) a long way away. The rooms are scarce poorly designed and the corridors deeply depressIng showing all the dusty inner workings of the hotel. And we could hear the plumbing from nearby rooms. Definitely not recommended.
50,I was in Vegas for a short amount of time. I was just there for a BTS concert. While I had a little trouble with my room keys the woman who assisted me was lovely. The room was clean the bed was comfy. And the location was great for walking to and from Allegiant Stadium. I was really only in the room to sleep but it was a nice room.
50,We have a great experience With the staff resolved our mobile check in issue and had us checked in within 5 min! The location is also perfect if you do not wish to drive during your stay everything is walking distance.
30,For the amount paid you get an ok hotel that feels safe but needs a lot of upkeep. If you can afford a little more upgrade to another hotel Mandalay is next door (MGM). LUXOR is the nicest hotel only if you are on a tight budget.
10,room was not worth the price and if you are male do not use the toilet 3 Starbucks on site within 500 feet of each other only 1 open the morning i tried long lines. room dated and had no view overlooked mechanical equipment on the interior view
40,The hotel was very easy to find at any time of night simply because of the beacon light from the pyramid. I wish they hadn’t plastered the side of the pyramid with advertising. The pool area was really nice and casino has been kept up. But room lacked basic amenities like a mini fridge.
50,The Luxor was super busy.With it being the last 2 BTS concerts. Yet every staff I encountered was helpful and so nice. From the front desk to the maid service. Just all around friendly. I was able to get an early check-in and they upgraded my room.
40,The only bad thing about staying at the Luxor was the lack of cleaning services during our stay. We stayed for 3 nights and didn’t put up the do not disturb sign during cleaning hours they obviously entered our room because they left lights on that we had turned off. Not a thing was touched. With a lack of trash cans in the room it would have been nice to have them emptied at least once.
10,"I give this hotel 1 star as the AGT Live show was AMAZING! As far as everything else I would give it negative stars if I could!    Hospitality teaches a ""can-do attitude"" and do anything/everything in service of a guest. Not at Luxor! They specialize in saying no it's not my problem or simply passing the buck!    In these tough economic times hotels are fighting over guests to stay in business. Apparently at the Luxor business must be good because they do not care about their guests.    It's too bad we loved AGT Live! The food was good and the pool area was relaxing. But if you ask me if I would stay here again? HECK NO! I will find another hotel that will appreciate my business!    Btw...don't try and ask for contact information regarding their Leadership. Everyone at the Front Desk is trained to say that they do not give out that information. When asked when they are on duty they say that their schedule always changes and they do not know.    So good luck trying to talk to someone! Better yet save your breath and stay somewhere else!"
30,Located at the very south of the strip which is not an issue if you only plan to stay at Luxor Mandalay and Excalibur. If you do want to go anywhere else be prepared to walk or shell out for transportation. Buffet is very basic preferred to pay the extra addition to go to a nicer buffet like bacchanal or wicked spoon. Spa was nice even if you don't get a massage the admission fee to just use the sauna steam room and jacuzzi was worth for a bit of relaxation. Room was okay nothing bad to say other than our room was really far from the elevators and the showers are designed oddly. Otherwise was clean and wifi worked well within the room. Staff are nice and there are multiple Starbucks on premise. Ended up paying a really high rate because they jacked up prices due to a concert happening on the weekend. Found out they lowered the prices a few days before our actual stay because they couldn't sell out rooms but wouldn't provide a refund. That's kinda on me for trying to book in advance but I'm still bitter about it. Be sure to check your refund policy and have a good time.
10,I don’t need to go into details about my stay. All I will say is Managers Arron and Bianca are useless and need to be retrained in customer service. Very poor service shame on Luxor. I have always stayed there and never again!
40,Took a quick trip to Vegas week of 4/12 - 4/16/22 the Luxor was a nice place for the price Room was clean and nice main hallway areas could be cleaned a bit more casino was nice breakfast buffet was good with a wide variety swimming pools where nice and the staff was very good. Use the luxor app to check in its fast and efficient otherwise you will be in line for a loooong time. Had a great trip
10,Multiple members of staff were very rude to my party and other guests. They did not seem interested in resolving issues. Room and carpet was dirty. We cancelled our upcoming stays due to this bad experience.
40,Stayed at the Luxor because we were going to the BTS Concert. Walked to Allegiant stadium. Was a bit of a walk for a senior citizen! Had a lot of places to eat. Luxor is connected to Mandalay Bay so we didn't have to go outside to get to the Shark Aquarium. A little bit dated but overall a good place to stay!
40,This was a family trip for daughters and myself. We loved the location of our hotel. We enjoyed the skybridge to Mandaly Bay and Excalibur. We came to town to see BTS and were thrilled to return to the Luxor. Hopefully we can return again
10,Zero recognition of my Hyatt globalist and MGM gold elite statuses.    First room had hair in sheets and feces stains on toilet seat.    The smell of smoke permeated into guest rooms.    I was never thanked for staying or asked about my stay.    Manager offered $100 F&B credit but literally nothing was open at that time of night to eat. He then offered to comp my stay but I was still charged for the resort fee taxes and parking.    Will never return to any MGM property.
10,The stay was terrible overpriced for what was provided. Elevators were barely operating. Service was 4 hours slow and rooms were not well maintained and TV was broken. The downstairs area was also very dirty.
40,Unique place to stay. We got a room inside the pyramid and the elevator ride to the room was an experience. I wish there were windows so you could see the lobby as you rode up/down. Room was large and very clean. No in room fridge but plenty of storage.
10,Heard so much about Luxor of there events and how nice the hotel was with lots of action and excitement. Oh boy was I wrong word of mouth is strong when mentioning how awesome a place is to visit and come back to. Will not come back super was disappointment and for a vacation event for me and my family this has to be one of the worst stays ever.
20,"We had a ""trip planner"" who was interested in saving money vs. location and quality of rooms/property. If this is you you'll be ok here. Rooms are tired. Hotel hallways are dark and dirty. Front desk staff was pleasant."
10,Sun 17 Apr 2022 I arrived around 8:15 AM at the Luxor to check-in. I was told by the Customer Service Representative that it was to early to check-in and come back at 11:30 AM for a room. I came back at 11:30 AM and waited in a long line for check-in. A different Customer Service Representative took my information and I paid cash for the full balance of a room in which I was NOT assigned a ROOM NUMBER at 12:08 PM. The Customer Service Representative asked me for my mobile phone number in which I provided and said she would text me with a Room Number. The Customer Service Representative did not text me with a Room Number. Around 8:00 PM I went back to a different Customer Service Representative and was given my Room Number. I inquired about how to use the $50.00 resort credit and the $20.00 Free Play and the Customer Service Representative answered my questions to satisfaction. During the length of my stay I called housekeeping multiple times (over 4) regarding having 4 set of towels (4 Bath 4 Hand and 4 Face) for 2 people occupying the room.  Fri 15 Apr 2022 around 1:15 AM when I was about to take a shower I noticed that there was no water coming out of any of the facets and the toilet would not flush. I reported to a Customer Service Representative that there was no water coming out of the faucets and that the toilet would not flush due to no water. The Customer Service Representative asked me did I receive a memo that maintenance on the East Wing was being performed from 1:00 AM to 5:00 AM on Fri 15 Apr 2022 and that no water would be available during that time which affected 14350 East Room. I requested another room; however the Customer Service Representative said all rooms are full. However the Customer Representative said that 3 nights of the Resort Fee would be refunded to me due to the inconvenience. Sat 16 Apr 2022 at 9:30 PM I came back to the ROOM and noticed that the ROOM was NOT CLEANED for the day. I called down to housekeeping and told them that the room was not cleaned. I asked how long it would take to clean the room and housekeeping responded 45 minutes. I was checking out early on Sunday morning and asked housekeeping to bring up 4 sets of towels remove the dirty towels and empty the waste baskets. Housekeeping performed the requested tasks. Sun 17 Apr 2022 I went down to Check-Out and found that I was being double charged for the ROOM. I paid cash for the room on Sun 10 Apr 2022. The room was charged on my credit card on Sun17 Apr 2022. I showed the Customer Service Representative my cash receipt that the room was paid in full and that I was to be reimbursed 3 nights of the resort fee for the inconvenience of the water outage that took place on Fri 15 Apr 2022. The Customer Service Representative had to leao ve twice and talk it over with the Manager. Finally after 20 minutes the Manager came out and assisted the Customer Service Representative to remove all charges from my credit card and reimbursed me a cash refund for the 3 nights resort fee for the inconvenience of the water outage that took place on Fri 15 Apr 2022. There was a balance of $7.42 on my credit card due to going over the $50 resort credit. I requested this amount to be removed from my credit card and I paid cash for the amount. The Customer Service Representative performed the requested task.
50,I would say there was close to 100 people in line just to drop off luggage since it was before check-in. However once we got past all that the room was very nice and comfortable. Loved the decor in the room. Was disappointed we didn’t get a pyramid room like we had requested but the room we got was nicer.
50,Amazing stay it was clean and centrally located to all the events I was attending. Would highly recommend and definitely coming back for any future stays. Always order ahead for starbucks. They are really conveniently located and they get really busy.
30,Hotel is a little dated compared to other properties on the strip. The carpets in the casino seemed older and the smell of old cigarette smoke. I would say that service on the casino floor was very good.
10,My hotel room was absolutely not worth the price. Broken tiles in the bathroom no hot water the second night. My room was over the Uber/Lyft pickup and there was honking and yelling most of the night
50,Love the architectural history of the place plus the location that is close to all. The restaurants are good at reasonable price. Lastly the MGM rewards program works great. Would love to visit the place again.
10,One of my rooms was moldy and manager Garrick refused to change room because I’m a gold mgm reward member and got one room for free. I usually spend a lot of money at whatever resort i stay making me stay at Gold level for years
30,The location was amazing however there were issues with us getting to sleep. Showing up the A/C was out of order it kept resetting itself to 80 degrees even after changing it multiple times. That was taken care of after notifying the staff but a new issue came up. After the relocation and throughout the rest of our stay no one came to change the sheets or do any of the other cleanliness or stock operations. 3/5 mainly because the staff was so easy to work with and everyone was very polite. A good place to stay on the strip just details that need to be worked out
50,I have mlife and was able to have a connector room and everything was completely free. Rooms were clean view ok only negative was there wasn’t an option for in dining room service. Slots were hot. Not long lines for food. Overall good trip.
10,Room not clean when checked in or all day. Had to fight with reception over the phone about and was told we were responsible for requesting cleaning after a guest. Went to front desk to speak with manager they gave us another room and waived some fees but was still unacceptable.
40,The hotel is located in a great location to be able to walk and tram the most of the strip. We enjoy the mlife staff and they are great to reduce your bill with your mlife rewards. Good parking and pool.
50,This trip was AMAZING!! Barely slept but when I did the Luxor was awesome staff was friendly and helpful. Will definitely be back again!! Any and everything was available to get in the gift shop and we enjoyed everything about the pyramid!!
20,Are room was 80 degrees and the front desk knew about it . There's nothing worse then taking a shower and sweating to put your cloths on . Every penny we put in the slots went right threw . Plus I could believe all the young kids running around and even seen them playing slots . Was a worst trip to the luxor
50,Great for a quick overnight in Vegas. Caught a Blue Man Group show. Room was quiet and clean in the East Tower. Slight delay at check in due to a long line. Probably just a testament to it's popularity. Would definitely return.
40,When in Vegas you don't spend too much time at your hotel. But when you do the little time there counts. Luxor was a nice stay rooms are clean and comfortable staff is kind and helpful. Would stay again.
20,The check in experience was awful had to wait in lines forever for basic questions. Nobody wanted to assist… Never did receive my credits or free play I was told I’d get by the Casino in January. They did give us late check out after explaining to a manager our issues all week. That’s the only reason they got a 2 and not a 1 rating. We had 5 rooms and 8 people booked but won’t be back will return to our normal place of stay up the strip.
50,Everyone we encountered this year was kind and courteous. The MLife program is phenomenal if you use it correctly and they all took very good care of us. South end of the strip is a bit quieter but just a short walk to the craziness when your ready.
20,No benefit of staying here at all. Everyone has their hand out wanting a tip for anything. Rooms are dated don't stay at the west tower near the pool the music they play will drown out the tv in your room.
30,Cleanliness was an issue. Otherwise the Luxur was fine as an average Vegas hotel. Our room was not cleaned it reeked of smoke and full length mirror had something smeared on it that wasn’t cleaned our entire stay.
50,Great time. Clean casino Big choice in machines great food good service nice pool can’t wait to get back excellent staff parking was easy remodeled rooms were really nice waitresses excellent service Will be back
20,We had a corner king suite it has everything you need. However you can't get any rest with the workers on the top of the building. Waking up at 730830 and 930 am seeing a man crawl across the window while your naked in bed is not the best feeling. This happened Tuesday-Friday. They worked until dusk the ropes on the window made it hard to relax when I needed a break from the strip.
20,The hotel design is spectacular. I had multiple problems beginning with the check in process and throughout our stay. Please be advised there is a $200 security deposit upon check in; you're supposed to get it back within 15 days. The food is really expensive especially for those with children. The check out process was a mess. You're advised to check out via the app but it showed I had a balance although I paid the balance when I checked in. I stood in line for 35 minutes when a customer service rep walked passed and she told me the app wasn't accurate and I just needed to leave the keys. The Luxor is too expensive for customers to encounter any problems.
50,thanks luxor for this quality time that i spend with my lovely wife it was our honeymoon the experince here was the best ever i will recomend this for any especial ocasion or couples that want a little bit time along thanks luxor again!!!!
10,Rude staff dirty room didn’t get resolved was overcharged I was tried canceling and going to a different room but they didn’t give me the option to cancel they said I would still be charged for everything
50,This was our 3 time at the Luxor we love the openness of the Hotel staff was very nice and helpful  room was clean We totally appreciated the help and kindness of our slot machine worker MAGGIE MORALES she totally took care of us with all our needs  and more she really looks out for the customer  Thank you for everything you did. Will see you soon again.
20,Checking in was a nightmare extremely long line slow service changed our room and tried to explain it was an upgrade when it really wasn’t finally got the room we wanted and that we originally booked and paid for after waiting for front desk to come back from talking with manager elevators or not working properly and could get stuck in them for 15 minutes before you finally were able to get to your room our TV did not work in our room we called the front desk the first night was put on hold for 25 minutes and gave up and went to bed the next day we called again and they never sent anybody
50,Love these rooms. Plenty of room and a refrigerator and coffee is a HUGE plus. Great staff and great experience. Will be back again since we do about every 6-8 weeks. I would like a host here though since I have one at other places. Haven’t had one reach out yet 🤷🏼‍♀️
10,There was urine and body fluids stains all over mattress sheets and blankets. There was no running water for half the night. Horrible customer service. Never stay here! I tried calling the front desk and no one ever answered the phone. Housekeeping was rude when I talked to them.
40,Good place if you are going with friends the only bad thing I have to say it’s beds so uncomfortable old mattress the rest of hotel casino okay the good thing is the food court buffet closes at 3 and pool closes early too so close to airport 20 taxi so I guess ok 👍
30,Based on what was paid the stay was average. MGM/Luxor really does need to step up its game when it comes to room prep chances of winning (not meaning giveaways but come on not one jackpot experienced or witnessed over 4 days?) and proper front desk staffing.
30,Old carpet old rooms not to clean. The only good thing is the staff that are very nice and courteous. Our check-in took us an hour after a six hour flight so not the best arrival experience. Their online check in process does not accommodate Canadian paperwork.
50,We wanted a hotel with a nice  Pool and was told to try the  Luxor. We were not disappointed. Mobile check in was fast room was large and very clean. Only downside was the location if you wanted to go down the strip with r Fremont you need to take a cad or Lift.
40,Overall Luxor staff is very friendly and helpful however their housekeeping department is not keeping up with all other casinos on the strip. My family had to sleep in dirty sheets since no one came to clean my room and when I called for service I that was told no one is available at this time You have to make sure that you get in touch with the supervisor if nobody shows up at a scheduled cleaning time.
50,Got in way early around 7am or 8am (drove all night from SF Bay Area to Las Vegas) and the lady that checked us in . I cannot recall her name i think it was Julie she said she had been working at the Luxor since day one basically. She got us an early check-in with a room upgrade to boot  I hope someone somewhere lets Julie know that she absolutely made our trip amazing from day 1! She upgraded us from a Pyramid King room to a Tower King Room it was amazing! The soaking tub was awesome ! Room was very clean  the floor was mostly quiet as quiet as it could be for one of the busier times of year March madness had just started and St.Paddys day was when we arrived. The casino was nice pretty clean the bartender at the lobby bar was quick. The ladies that walked around with drinks were quick as well ! Had a beer and some appetizers at Public House fair prices the portions were massive. Diablos Cantina was great the food was delicious and was fairly priced as well. Went to Bodies for the 3rd time for myself and my fiances first time that was a fun experience as it always is. Johnny Rockets was also a good late night munchie. The Tram that runs between Excalibur and Mandalay was also punctual as well!
40,The Luxor is an iconic hotel on the strip I have maintained it quite well it is good value for the money. If you are a Canadian watch out with your MGM rewards because we couldn’t travel for two years your rewards will be bumped down two levels completely unfair but I guess that’s the price we pay
10,Room smelled horrible no room service at hotel all places to eat are slow and busy not close to the best shops fire alarm went off on the whole floor for over 20 minutes waking my whole family and staff just said sorry. It was so loud and awful!
40,The room was clean quite and it was easy to maintain comfortable temperature.  The check-in process was a little bit hectic but manageable. The check-out was the simplest one. :)  It would be better if the room had a microwave.
10,Terrible check in/ check out experience impossible to drop a luggage simply lines were not acceptable and that was before Spring Break can t even imagine the chaos it was when we left - the lines were getting even worse. No one cares about well being of the guests. Rooms are mediocre the towers ones were stayed are outdated and over priced. Vending machines with Water do not work there is water in the room either. There is no room service available. Clearly you could tell that post covid the hotel fails to have real Operations in place to operate at full capacity. Bell desk to pick up luggage was the worst....Very very disappointing. The walls are extremely thin so if your neighbors snores (and compared to other things we heard would not be too bad lol) you will hear them. There are way better options on the Strip.
50,My daughter and I decided to take a trip to Vegas. We went on the weekdays and the room rates were very reasonable. The rooms were nice. We were very happy. The hotel is at one end of the strip so be prepared to walk. The restaurants food is great. Not cheap but not super expensive. There's a walkway to the Excalibur and shops and eateries in between.
40,The only real issue is the rooms don't have a mini refrigerator or coffee maker or any way to heat water. The room is good comfortable no issues and the casino is great employees are respectful and friendly. I did put in a request for a room with a view for a birthday trip but ended up with probably room with worst view in West tower
50,Had a great time- the staff was also very helpful and we did not have a bad experience at all. They also had plenty of places to get snacks and food late night. It was clean for the most part and close to the airport
20,Don't expect the rates to be a reason to stay. Parking is $15 per exit even for MGM card members. Fees in addition to the rate for the room equaled more than $60 daily. Also be prepared to bug the staff if you want housekeeping services. There are no refrigerators/microwaves or coffee makers in the rooms either.
40,Hotel was great except we wish they would have a fridge and a microwave in the room. Otherwise the early check in digital key and accessible entrance to the Tower Premium rooms are a plus. Our room was clean bed was comfy.
50,Clean rooms and great service! We went to Vegas for Spring break and had an amazing time at the Luxor Hotel. Great amenities and a easy walk between hotels. Must see the Zac Bagans Haunted Museum while in town.
30,This check in on your own is for the birds! No help  slow as molasses internetfrustration galore! but there was NONE! There's nothing like getting that one on one personalized service. Forget this place
20,My title says it all. Over-pricedtired dark dirty with unfriendly staff and dealers. Nothing appealing about this property of my experience. Very loud rooms which are open to the casino floor along with ancient in room ac units. MGM appears to have invested zero in this property since it was build in the early 1980's. One of the worst casino's on the strip but charging better quality casino prices. If it's comped go ahead and stay. If not comped strongly recommend that you stay elsewhere.
20,The room smelled like farts. We had to keep the ac on high and vents on because of the horrible smells. The lamp next to the bed would turn off every time I got out the bed. The mini fridge was dirty and the door didn’t close all the way. The ceiling in the living portion of the corner suite had a huge drink stain for someone throwing a drink into the air. Got hit with a horrible smell every time we would return to to the room. Pretty sure our shower was missing a door unless it was made without out a door or anything to stop the water from falling on the bathroom floor.
20,We got a room in the pyramid & the AC didn’t work there were not enough towels and not enough hooks in the bathroom for more than one person. Also we called for more towels and it took 2 hours for us to receive them.
30,Hotel was out dated. Staff was extremely slow. And the app was horrible kept crashing and nothing worked right. Room wasn't very clean when we arrived.  It was fun to stay some place new though so that wasn't too bad.
20,Upon check in our the line was very very long even after checking in with the mobile app we had get in line because it was not assigning a room. We got back in line only to find out that room was sold due to over booking and we had to wait a little longer for a room. After all the trouble they charged us for our third guest in room even after the room is displayed as for four people.
20,I went for the Luxor with my Fiancé while the room was nice the service from the service was poor. Unlike our first visit where they were totally welcoming helpful and outstanding and that was doing Covid
20,Room had several problems and they never offered a different room. The strike plate on the door came off the screws were stripped out and we couldn’t close the door securely. The a/c went out and was blowing hot air all day while we were out - they never fixed the a/c but gave us two fans! One of which was broken and missing two blades so it bounced all over the floor. The next morning went to the front desk and they gave us another fan instead of another room - horrible stay and experience- they didn’t even try to make it right. Pyramid room
30,Luxor standard pyramid room was basic with limited amenities. I'm a gold card member and rewards benefits state a complimentary upgrade upon check-in. However that was never offered. Gaming slots looser than most casinos I been too but limited selection. I may stay again.
30,The Luxor is a WALK from the strip be sure to wear comfy shoes. The rooms did not have best linens shampoo/soap and there was hair in the carpet (NOT my own). It was also difficult to navigate but that may just be the purpose of a casino.
10,There were bed bugs in the bed so they moved us to a different room. The next room had stained sheets. So gross! Digital key did not work leaving us stuck in an elevator. Horrible experience. Do not stay at the Luxor ever! Security had to be called at 2am to remove the people in the next room.
40,Key less entry doesnt work just get a normal room key. The pools closed before 8 so no night tine hot tubbing. And on vheck out day we had 2 different maids open the door while we were naked to see if we checked out starting at 8 30 am so be dressed because they just unlock and come in. Other than that the room was nice big and clean the servers took forever atvthe slots so bring your own drinks. Also super annoying people who want you yo go look at the time share offering you everything from food and slot vouchers to shows. They ask you a million times and when you say no some make comments like you dont have to be rude when all you said was no after the 10th person has asked you in 2hours. Annoying and rude.
10,Not a pleasant experience overall. This hotel is dark and uninviting. The hotel rooms are extremely outdated and everything felt dirty. The towels had little hairs in them and the tub wouldn’t drain properly so it would fill up half way while I showered. The elevators were really outdated and the doors would shake while it moved. The electrical boxes in the elevators were almost always open for some reason. Overall a terrible experience.
50,Beautiful hotel and staff were helpful and friendly. Lots to do and see. Very good food. Good location. Easy to walk. I like the hotel feature if you are not on the floor your staying at you can not get on the floor. Room services and house keeping excellent.
50,Suite was very clean very very nice ammenities hotel and casino staff professional and courteous. Casino is always energetic! Walking distance to many great restaurants shows and shopping. We will be back!!!
50,This was my first time at the Luxor. We really enjoyed our stay. The room was recently renovated so it was nice and clean. We stayed inside the pyramid. The restaurants were plentiful and the shows were great. My only preference is that I like to stay in the center of the strip. It was pretty far away from the rings I like most. I do love the theme here the best though!
50,Ballys first. Room surprisingly right outside window was Paris tower. Then to Luxor for ACM Awards. I had also made reservations for Ramsay steak when I first knew I was coming to the awards. I watched Hell’s Kitchen to see Trenton Garvey fight his way to be the Head chef. I got to meet him and talk to him. Of course he asked me where I was from and I giggled and said Michigan one of the states they kept thinking you were from even though you were from Missouri. He was a very polite and wonderful person and the food was excellent!!!!  I went to Hell’s Kitchen before Ramsay Steak. The people there were so polite professional and acted as though you were their favorite guest. The food I knew I was going to have at Ramsay Steak I wanted to try different here. I just cannot believe how the experience and taste and enjoyment this experience was!!! Food was great!!  I walked all over the areas and had a fantastic time. Just didn’t check weather channel to see it would be cool very windy to make it even cooler. So suggest you do that so you don’t have to purchase 2 hooded coats to go over your own fleece jacket and rely upon the 1 pair of jeans you have. LOL
50,I met some friends there good room very nice place to eat drink and gamble. Took advantage of the buckets of beer.I drove in from California valet worked well I would return and I am sure my friends will as well.
40,i stayed in the east tower which i didn’t care for friends trip. there were load and noises people on my hall. last night someone tried to to get in my room. all n all it was average. when i stayed in the pyramid it was fabulous
50,Great customer service At the front desk and everyone is so very helpful My room was very clean the location is fantastic able to get on the rail and go to other hotels and come back on the rail I had a Great birthday thank
50,The whole experience was wonderful. Beautiful property great service and good prices. Downfall- no room service . The rooms were clean. Check in was a breeze. The restaurant selection is good. I had Mexican one night and steak the next.
50,I loved my room the design was very nice room was very nice and it looked good as well. One of the nicest rooms I've had I'm Vegas amd I've stayed all over Vegas. I will be visiting this room again.
50,First time to stay at this hotel. Great service and enjoyed the room. The elevator were awesome! The casino has plenty of slots as well as wonderful service that was provided by staff and employees on the casino floor.
50,Beautiful clean rooms good food fun entertainment and wonderful friendly people that work there. Enjoyed gambling and able to have great drinks. Will definitely hope to return aging some day just to make me happy.
40,They offer spa gym & salon. I was only able to use the gym which was great!    I enjoyed the casino. Employees were kind. I enjoyed the little deli they have. Expensive just like everywhere else.    Parking - checked in at the hotel I was hoping it would have been free but it is not.
20,Reception by front desk clerk was not very inviting. The smell of sewer when you walk in was also not inviting.  The plumbing in our hotel room was bad drains were very slow left dirty water sitting for awhile before it went down same with shower.
50,The room was in an excellent location room service was friendly and all the restaurants had good food. Most the slots were paying and the staff was friendly and informative.the best time is on the weekend when there's plenty of cocktail waitresses
50,The hotel was nice with lots of things to do on site. It has places to eat in every price range. The staff were knowledgeable of places to go and things to do both on site and out and about. The only issue was the bathroom shower. It had a half door so when you showered the floor got wet. Suggest they put full coverage doors on the shower stalls before someone falls.
40,Had a good time but really wish you would have pool ready like other hotels do when we come. This is the second time we have come when we had to go to another hotel to use their pool instead of Luxor. We make it work but it is a long walk!
50,The stay was good. Checking in was smooth thanks. Everyone was happy with the rooms  The food at the food court was awesome. We will always choose the Luxor as one of the hotels we stay. I would have liked to win more money but this is Vegas so thanks for all your hospitality.
40,I stayed at the Luxor for the vet conference at Mandalay Bay. It was an easy walk over to the conference center. The room was nice and comfortable. The housekeeping service was great. The price was affordable. The front desk staff was friendly and helpful. I enjoyed spending time at the spa one afternoon.  My only complaint was a very noisy next door neighbor late into the night.
50,Mobile check-in was fast and easy. The pyramid room I stayed in was recently renovated. Much better than when I stayed a couple years ago. Blue man group was amazing. My son had a great time in the hyper x esports arena. If you have a kid that is a gamer or YouTuber I highly recommend it.
40,Very nice hotel and friendly staff. We enjoyed our one night stay and would live to come back again sometime. The hotel is very conveniently located near shops restaurants and of course has a casino.
40,The check in on your phone saves a lot of time in line waiting to check in. Rooms were very clean and nice. Bed was very comfortable. Pool area was very nice and well staffed. Plenty of food options..
30,Room was basic elevator was a little shaky! However casino was beautiful and the food at the bar and grill was fantastic. Live music was very entertaining and the valet staff were very nice and helpful.
50,Great vacation  The room was fabulous and kept well clean and accommodated my expectations! I would stay at Luxor on my next trip. Make sure you have breakfast at the pyramid cafe. The food was very tasty and the portions were very good.
50,Stay was great. Was busy but check moved quickly. Also advised that next time I could do self check in which I will do next time. Also did check out on my own from room which is great.  Rooms was good size and very clean  Front desk offered upgrade when I arrived which was great.
50,Clean room. Quiet & comfortable didn’t like the elevator. Lol. We enjoyed the coffee shop. Like the slot machines. I saw some old machines that I enjoyed. I don’t like this 200 characters. If I know this I would have deleted it
50,Wonderful accommodations and great place to find quality eating establishments. Staff were very friendly and caring. As far as entertainment not only fun gaming but a lot of other things to do! I’ll be going back!
40,Booked a Pyramid Corner 2 queen suite with the Soaking tub booked the room by just walking up to register no websites used.  Enjoyed the hotel cleanliness the updated feel and the effort to stay trendy and relevant with the new decades.
50,Gave me a free upgrade upon checking in and the room In the west tower was amazing definitely would stay there again they pretty much have a lot of stuff inside the Luxor and service and room was great
40,Just fine. Will probably try another hotel next visit to Vegas. The hotel buffet was so overpriced and did not offer any options for those with dietary restrictions. The bathroom and rooms need updated however the beds were comfortable along with the pillows. Spacious but even the smoke free rooms smelled heavily of smoke.
50,Had a great time great customer service! The property was beautiful and was well maintained! The do a great job keeping only guest that should be on or around property are there no bums can’t wait to go back
50,Great customer service. Had a blast all weekend. It was for my bachelor party. Everyone was very nice rooms were great as well. I would recommend this hotel to anyone that asked me. I will go back in the future no doubt.
50,Week away with the wife for our honeymoon travelling from Ireland. Great rooms. Friendly staff. Well located. Highly recommend when staying in Las Vegas. Elevators are something else travelling at a 39degree up the pyramid shape hotel.
30,Food and drinks were very expensive you couldn't afford to stay long  Bed was very comfortable. Our room had a fridge but my daughters did not. Need coffee pot in rooms. One of the elevators shook it was scary.
50,This was another great stay at the Luxor. I enjoy the Luxor because of its price point. If you want you can spend a lot of money in Vegas. The Luxor provides me with good restaurants not only in the pyramid but in Mandalay Place and Mandalay resort. The gaming atmosphere is exciting while still comfortable. Over the years when I have had an issue they have always been prompt to resolve it.
10,"Tub dirty / outlets didn't work / NO real food after 3 pm. Last time we stayed at Luxor it was awesome. What happened? New management? Waited for maintenance for over an hour. No show - even after I called 2nd time & told ""20 minutes."
30,The hotel was a complete disappointment. From the rooms to the service to the amenities in the rooms...completely disappointed. There are only 2 reasons I gave them 3 stars...the valet team was AMAZING. They helped me with EVERYTHING!!!!! Also we were there for a huge volleyball tournament so the amount of people they needed to service was extreme. In my personal opinion the management teams should have extra staff on hand for large events like this to make the process smoother and more enjoyable for the families.
40,Great place to stay when you are playing a tournament at the Mandalay Bay Convention Center. Easy to walk between the Luxor and the courts. Didn’t need a rental car. Only downside is there was no refrigerator so we wasted a lot of food.
30,Bad stay. Issues were never resolved. Issue addressed many times. Sheets were dirty. No one answered the phone even though we stayed during the week which it wasnt even busy for them not to answer. Noone seemed to care to fix our issue.
10,Guest rooms were horrible and worn down. Furniture had multiple scratches and chipped wood. Pictures on website does not match the room once you get there. Elevators were extremely unsafe. Very shaking and felt like it was going to stop running while we were on it. Morning staff is also very rude.
40,Nothing bad to say only sad thing was the cafe and grill were closed on a monday when the hotel was booked up. Room ac was not blowing cold air at full force but the shower water pressure is amazing
50,I find myself staying at Luxor time and time again due to the location value and overall quality. Furthermore the staff is accommodating and will see to it that my stay is comfortable and memorable. The casino level is spacious the food is good and I enjoy the second level as well. Luxor is ‘home’ to me in Las Vegas.
10,By far the worst place I have every stayed in! It’s my fault for thinking I couldn’t be catfished by a Vegas mgm website! Everything was not good! Very disappointed a motel 6 was more furnished that this premier suite how sad is that! The tv made me feel like I time traveled back to when this tv came to stores back in the early 2000 the picture was so old and I could not believe this was what a suite has! We stayed here 5 nights like come on now! Lesson learned! Caesars rewards will be the way to go! I regret this decision!
50,Great place; Good Rates; Nice rooms. Housekeeping was daily and did an excellent job. Location on the strip was also great. Free tram to other nearby hotels was also convenient. Digital key into rooms and using elevators was challenging at times; two of the elevator readers were broken down
10,We reserved 3 rooms 2 of the rooms were never cleaned no fresh towels very outdated. Dirt on the walls Fingerprints on the pitcher in the bathroom Somebody else's hairs were in our room on the towels towels were all stained. I would never stay there again. My daughter was also told that they would be there at 3 o'clock that day to do their room and they never showed up the whole time we were there and we stayed there for 3 nights.
30,Rooms need lots of upkeep and cleaning. First checked in room corner suite at 5pm wasn’t cleaned at all second room had hair in bathroom and shower head was falling out of wall. Staff was friendly and accommodating and casino was very clean. Food was very good and AGT show was very fun. Easy in/out with Uber and close to the airport.
30,For the price it is underwhelming. It's a nice hotel and casino but for longer stays you will be disappointed. Of all the problems I would suggest getting dealers that enjoy being with players. Players can still have fun even when losing. Next suggestion would be to clean the pool area. The chairs are nasty and the music is terrible.
20,Bad experience bad customer service Bianca was very unfriendly and I willing to help MGM property seem to Penny pinch property nice not good for a staycation would not recommend today actually I'll be staying at the four Queens hotel where they don't charge you extra for parking and I'll be enjoying a nice atmosphere
50,Great space AGT was a great show too!!  Lots of gaming space pool was perfectly loud and fun. Definitely worth a trip back through.  Also the food at the restaurant on the casino floor was fantastic 100% recommend the poke nachos
20,We reserved a King and got 2 double beds. NO REFRIGERATOR OR COFFEE POT. They said I would have to rent a refrigerator but had none. Although the housekeeping staff were very friendly and prompt Ill NEVER stay here again
30,Staff friendly but understaffed for how busy hotel is- hard to check in/out hard to find bell help (2 hour wait during check out) no fridge or coffee in room casino very smokey. Would not stay here with family again hard without fridge in room. We were booked next to loud party room could not sleep had to switch rooms.
20,You cannot use the pools at other attached or sister properties! Do not be fooled by what the website says the only reason I chose The lower price of Luxor over other resorts was because the website states you can use the Mandalay Bay pools but the only way you can use the pools at that resort is by presenting your Mandalay Bay room key. This was a huge disappointment for me being turned away when my child had his heart set on it.
10,The hotel room changed from cool to hot in a matter of minutes because the air conditioner had a mind of its own. There was no refrigerator or microwave! There was no full glass to cover the shower so water just went all over the bathroom floor which is dangerous! There were no towels brought to us after we asked housekeeping people face to face in the hallway to bring towels...it was just a mess!
40,"We booked into Luxor to attend the BTS concert. The hotel was ideally suited to Allegiant stadium just a 15 minute walk over the bridge. Staff was friendly and they had good restaurants nearby if pricier than I recall for Vegas.However I wasn't really that impressed for a room I paid over $400 per night. The room was very decently sized with good furniture. The decor was a little dated and there was an empty cabinet where I thought there would be a refrigerator. There were only 2 hangers in the closet. The TV was functional but cut off the left side of the screen so watching game shows was amusing. The bathroom was roomy and nicely remodeled but there wasn't a single place to hang a towel which I find shocking. I come from California where every single hotel has signs saying ""Please conserve water by hanging up your towel to reuse it."" So Las Vegas doesn't need to conserve water?"
40,We were told to expect the worst staying at the Luxor so anything above that was a bonus!    In all honesty the hotel was fine. The staff were great very friendly and helpful. Fidel at the pyramid cafe was really nice and took care of us all week.    The buffet staff were great and I can’t grumble about anywhere else.    The restaurants were fantastic especially the Steak restaurant the prime rib was outstanding.    The pool area was good with towel staff helpful but sometimes the waitresses were a bit miserable.    We stayed in the tower it was meant to be a premium room but I can’t say what was premium about it. It was old with broken tiles in the bathroom and a broken shower door however the shower was instantly hot every time and had plenty of power.    My only gripe with the room was that it wasn’t clean. I had to ask for them to clear the food debris off the bedside table on 2 occasions. They’ll probably blame covid for this.    Given that we didn’t spend long in the rooms and that we were told to expect a dump I wasn’t really that bothered about it to be honest. 6 of us stayed and no one had a bad stay. There’s plenty of facilities on site and the taxis outside are plentiful.    Casino floor is good but the bar staff are miserable they won’t serve you if you’re not in their ‘area’ yet will stand back and do nothing whilst you have to wait for your bartender.    The casino is one of the smokiest out of them all they need to sort ventilation out as it stings your eyes from all the chuffers in there.    All in all for the price we paid I would certainly stay here again. Location was great and we all had a good time.
20,Stayed at this hotel for a tournament. We arrived on a TH evening and it took an hour to check in. The line was 3 rows deep. The hotel didn’t staff enough for the check in. Got the room keys and went to the room. It was old outdated stains on the couch poorly lit dusty and looked and felt dirty. Also it was the not the room I booked. If you stay here don’t stay in the East tower. It’s gloomy to walk the halls and it’s away from everything. The West tower is a little better. The hotel does not provide water or coffee in the rooms and overcharge for everything….$4.50 for a bag of chips $9 water etc etc.. They know tournaments are going on but still don’t bring in extra staff to help. Expect to stand 45 minutes for coffee. This hotel is NOT as kid friendly as others. My daughter had to stare at inappropriate ads flashing through the large screens at checkin for an hour. This hotel is very sad. Nothing classy nothing special. I’m giving it two stars only because some of the staff are nice. Not all but some. My stay here makes me never want to visit Vegas ever again. And I hope the SCVA stops hosting with the MGM properties.
20,Was treated very badly and wasn’t told why my room was taken after I reserved it a month ago. The two Queen room suite I had reserved was for my Mom and Sister and her kids. Someone had to sleep on a rollaway and that wasn’t right.
20,Have stayed at the Luxor years ago and it has really went downhill. The virtual check in was great room card on phone until you get to the elevator and it doesnt read the card to get to your floor. Was stuck on another floor until housekeeping let us on our floor. The elevator shook and floor is on weird incline didn't feel safe. Room is outdated they removed all refrigerators and charge you $25 a day to rent one. The bath tub would not drain. Bed was comfortable but thats it. Would not stay again.
50,Had a wonderful stay @ the Luxor Great and friendly staff as well as a great Casino. The restaurants in the Luxor I ate at were top notch. I really look forward to my next visit to the Luxor. I highly Recommend it.
10,This place was a mess.. I was there for 4 days and no one ever came to our room for new towels or anything even after we requested them! This place is so dated.. I’ve stayed in better super 8s and motel that was better than this! Not worth the money
50,Perfect for guests attending concerts or events at Allegiant Stadium next door. The walk to the stadium is ~10 minutes or less and well-lit even at night. The elevator is unique in its diagonal/sideways movement quite fun. Would've been nice to have had a mini fridge with at least some water or some snacks in the hotel room. That was the only thing missing I think. For lack of time I didn't get to make use of the pool gym or other amenities but I would like to return another time and do so. The staff was very helpful with check in check out and directions even late at night and early in the morning. Enjoyed the concert and enjoyed my stay!
20,My 14-year-old daughter and I were in town to attend and participate in the Southern California volleyball Association presented red rock rave volleyball tournament. We were at the convention center at Mandalay Bay most of the day on Friday and Saturday. We had an early court assignment Sunday morning. DJ was stationed in the lobby just below our hotel room in the main Pyramid. This was Saturday April 9. Music was exceptionally loud and at bedtime even with the air conditioner on to attempt to create some white noise to offset the music we were still kept up. I found guest services to ask how long the music would be playing and was told it would continue until midnight. We looked out our balcony door to see anywhere from 5 to 10 people actively participating in the event with the DJ. We asked if the music could be turned down considering such few participants. I was told this was outside the authority of the hotel and was strictly a casino activity. The guest services representative said he would call security to file a complaint. The music wasn’t turned down and didn’t stop until midnight. This had a direct impact in my daughters energy levels at the tournament the next day. We had a handful of other families also staying in the main pyramid and at least two others given their vicinity also complained as well.
50,I booked for our last night in Vegas because I heard it was haunted. My expectations were low because of other reviews. We booked a king room and it was clean and did not smell of smoke. At one point we locked ourselves out of our room and they told me I was going to have to wait for security to let me in my room and then show my ID to confirm my identity. My husband ended up having my ID in his wallet so I had a key made and security came up and checked on me to make sure I was ok! As far as haunted we went to the 12th floor (1214&16 are supposed to be the spooky floors) and I did feel like I was being pushed twords the railing and it was really cold on that floor as opposed to the eighth floor where we were staying. After my husband went to sleep I heard banging above us and I thought oh it's just the people above us. Then the banging went from the ceiling to the door but no one was in the hall. I also saw someone from the corner of my eye but they could have just been me wanting to see something. I turned out AC off because the room kept getting cold. It was weird. I felt like I was in an episode of ghost hunters 😂 I'll stay again for a longer amount of time. The price can't be beat. You're on the strip the rooms are decent and it's not a crappy motel. I'm a 30yr old woman that falls asleep to true crime so spooky is my thing though. Next time I'll ask for the poltergeist room🤷‍♀️ also note that I was not drinking at all so when I felt like I was being pushed I really felt like someone was walking beside me and pushing me against the railing but only on that floor. 10/10 will spooky again
30,The hotel was in the perfect location for my needs during the stay. The staff were all very friendly and helpful. The worse part of my stay which will likely be the reason I stay away was the overwhelming stinch of cigarette smoke emanating from the casino. It was brutal on my sinus and by the end of my 3 day stay my sinuses were completely irritated and a week later I'm still stuffy. (Already saw the doctor and it's not a cold)
30,Noisy room from casino floor area for 3 nights. The last 2 nights they must have turned off the speakers so we could no longer hear it in our room from floor 7. We actually got some rest. Coming out of our room overlooking the half wall lots of garbage and dirty. Dirty bathroom fan ( was dealt with right away with an apology and dinner gift card  nice touch ). The rest of the room was fine with nice view overlooking the pool and comfortable bed. TV small and fuzzy yet on the casino floor great picture. Elevators should to be a lot cleaner and are in need of repairs ( access panels open scratches the large panel shaking and rattling).Julie on the front desk was fantastic she actually cared what we experienced and promised to pass along the written comments I made for their consideration. We have been to Vegas many times and sad to say this was our worst stay. We moved from the MGM GRAND ( 4 nights) to the Luxor ( 5 nights) during this trip to Vegas ( no rooms at the Grand because of the Grammys) .Most of the staff we encountered at the Luxor were great.
10,There is nothing but a bed and a lamp in the room there is no refrigerator no coffee make not even a microwave. Then the pool is shut down at 6pm like really. Nothing fancy from this hotel at all not worth the stay.
10,Very dated hotel and no signs of remodel. Gloomy atmosphere with bad air quality and terrible casino. The staff is friendly but they lack numbers of help. Overall it was unpleasant and very Reno like Motel vs. a Vegas resort.
50,First time staying here and won’t be last. Considering it was a busy week that didn’t stop delivery of great service and accommodations. Staff friendly and helpful. Rooms were clean and updated. Heated pool was available for colder mornings.
50,perfect - it was everything I wanted in an escape!  Staff were all incredibly helpful and the facilities were excellent. I absolutely enjoyed my (first) visit to the spa for a full body scrub experience. Will happily return!
50,The room was decent and the casino itself was beautiful & cool! I just wish the room looked like the photos provided for us when first booked and that the view was better. Overall really great experience!
10,No soap in room rooms are decorated old cocktail drinks were no good Steak House over priced way over priced  the steaks were $70.00 and up and all you get is a disgusting vegetable no one was wearing a mask
10,Hotel is run down. Rooms are dirty carpet is filthy tile floors are stained cabinets in bathroom are chipped and stained. We had to stay here due to a stay and play for a volleyball tournament. Luxor needs a complete overhaul. They ask you to check in on their app and then it doesn’t work so you end up having to go back downstairs and stand in line to get keys. It was a mess.
40,Nice place.and excellent service! The tram make very easy to visit the other casinos. The staff was very helpful.  Plenty of shops and restaurants to enjoy delicious food and have a wonderful time with family.
30,The pyramid rooms have been renovated but the rest of the hotel looks dated run down and dirty. I was on the 7th floor and I could look down and see trash and dirt on top of the structures inside the pyramid my room was next to the food court and the smell of food went directly into our room. The elevator s were very mush need of repairs service panels opened the doors didn’t fully close. It looks like the out gold stickers on the doors to cover them up. Don’t even start with these elevators what a nightmare.
50,After reading some reviews I was a little concerned. However. We had a great experience. Our room was on the first floor which was so convenient for morning coffee. There was very little noise. Our room was clean. I have stayed at some more expensive hotels in Vegas but the only major difference was the view. We didn't have one due to being on the bottom floor.
30,Location and amenities were as expected for Vegas strip hotel. Cleanliness of elevator and hallways not the greatest. Also rooms seem a bit outdated and show there wear. Definitely time for MGM to consider some updates.
10,Way overpriced for the hotel you get. Doesn’t have basic things economy hotels have (microwave fridge coffee maker) the tv was ancient. I get its Vegas but this hotel is a joke. The mobile app is nice to check in with but the cell service is so bad it doesn’t work in parts of the hotel. And you need it for the elevators.  Not sure why the shower only has half glass so the water gets everywhere. That’s odd.  The casino slot machines aren’t any better than you’d find in a tribal casino. Quite a few of the buttons don’t work. Horrible drink service.  Also beware this is a pet friendly hotel so you could end up next to a barking dog like we did.  By far the worst mgm property I’ve ever stayed at. You’re just paying for the name at this point. And you’re paying a lot.  On the plus side is very close to the stadium which is why we booked it in the guest place.  In writing these reviews I don’t expect the management to care or change anything based on a bad review. But I hope it educates somebody out there to think twice before booking this hotel.
20,I reserved a king suite and was given a queen suite. The shower head was just hanging from the wall with no way to mount it. The curtains were broke and could not be completely closed. The chairs were very dusty. When we sat down you could smell the dust come out of them. The ice machine right outside the room was noisy and ran all night. My wife and I have stayed at the luxor a few times and enjoyed it more than any other casino. But this was a very disappointing stay.
10,The room smells so bad when we checked in it was later sprayed down to get rid of the odor. No room service for days I had to request for clean towels. The vent in the bathroom was so loud and the water pressure was beyond horrible. Disappointed don’t recommend staying here at all
30,We loved the location. That part of the strip and the Luxor seem most kid friendly. We got a premium room that was not premium. Ancient AC. Dirty windows you could barely see out of. Our bathroom had not been completely cleaned as there was used soap and hair in our shower
50,My daughter and I flew to Vegas to see Carrie Underwood's Reflection and our flight back home got canceled. We had to quickly search for a place to stay and ended up booking 2 nights at the Luxor. The check in desk crew was very helpful and friendly. We enjoyed the connections between the Mandalay Bay and Excalibur resorts. We ended up seeing The Blue Man Group (always a treat!) and the Titanic Exhibit.
30,To be fair I will start with the good. Our arrival was smooth front desk staff was attentive efficient we asked for an upgrade (with a small fee). We stayed in the new renovated rooms. The room was a a good size room adjacent to a small living area.  The bed was comfortable as were the pillows. The cleanliness was ok. We ate at the breakfast place (near our elevators) it was VERY good. The staff once again amazing. We rented a Cabana once again the staff amazing the cabana itself….not so good.    For the not so good the Hotel is quite run down it’s dark smelly. The elevators are quite the experience there were a few that we did not dare take! Each and everyone of them are very dirty from sealing to tiles disgusting really. We were on the 12th floor walking to our room we noticed the carpet walls and rooms doors were pretty banged-up.    Lastly use the Tram! Walking distance from anywhere is quite the hike!!    It’s unfortunate that the Hotel has gone down the way it has the staff makes up for it.  We will not be back unfortunately.
40,For price you can not go wrong. The ride share pick up is also super easy and quick. The staff were amazing other than the restaurant staff. I would stay her again. Upgrade to a suite the tub is worth it!
10,We were there for a girls volleyball tournament. I understand Las Vegas is a place people go to find the most base aspects of society but presenting it in lobbies where kids and families who don’t view humanity as exploitable is just gross and deplorable. Videos with graphic content was played on giant screens above the check-in/check-out counter. I’m pretty tolerant but blatantly exploiting women and objectifying them for all to see is inhumane and a sad state for our society. Grow up.
50,Awesome resort huge full of Egyptian characters! Restaurants were fantastic shows were great we were able to walk to multiple resorts without leaving the building simply awesome! In the Pyramid Cafe u must try the Pyramid Pancakes you'll eat for days!
20,Leaking AC will turn your socks yellow with mildew smell. No other rooms available but was comped resort fee ($35) not an even trade for what a room cost per night. Had to call back the next night to see if I could be transferred poor follow through.
30,I couldn’t even stay my last night because I couldn’t get parking and was forced to go home on my stay-cation due to no parking. I’m pregnant and really needed to lie down and rest. Guests should be able to park their car if they’re paying $150+ a night for the room.
20,We were given a dirty room and then not even an apology for this situation just a oops they accidentally marked it clean. We were there for our anniversary and it made what was suppose to be a exciting time and was so anxiety Ridden due to this and the fact that the manager didn't even see it a problem
10,The front desk was impossible to get a hold of and when we were able to reach them they were very rude! The morning of check out our tub would not turn off maint. spent over 3hrs in our room so we could not bathe before our road trip home. We asked the front desk for another temporary room so we could shower before our road trip home and they refused.
50,The best I can said no more better I will come back and visit stay and enjoy definitely this please again this hotel sttaf was the best the room service amazing no wonder why my room was impeccable I can suggest get better beds
30,They gave us a Suite where the A/C was broken. After some arguing they gave us a new Suite. Their customer service is okay after you press the matter you will wait on hold for at least 30 minutes when calling the front desk. But talking to someone face to face was great! Stay in one of the towers the pyramid rooms are trash! The Pyramid Café and Tender is AMAZING.
10,The bed sagged in the middle the room was musty the check in staff was rude we found an old stinky sweatshirt in the drawer. I would never stay there again. The check out was so slow two customers got into a yelling fight.
50,We had a great time for 3 nights at Luxor. Enjoyed the suite upgrade on the 14th floor with a beautiful pool view as a MGM Reward Gold benefits. Had a blast at the Fantasy show. Will definitely come back!
10,Looking for where I could plug in my devices upon check in opened drawer of the desk and found a pair of DIRTY WOMAN’S THONG UNDERWEAR presumably left by a prior guest. Makes me question how thoroughly cleaning is being done elsewhere in the room or hotel. Totally disgusting and unacceptable especially for $400+ a night!! Will never stay here again
30,This hotel is def older. For some reason they don’t have the small refrigerators in the rooms - you have to rent them for additional fees if you want one. There was a very distinct sewer smell in a section of the casino next to the steak restaurant. There were weird “plumbing noises” coming up through the shower drain that we’re very annoying especially when trying to sleep. We checked in online through the app but our room never said it was ready so we ended up having to go to the front desk anyway. I would not stay at this hotel again when there are so many other better options.
50,This was our first stay at the Luxor. We stayed in a King Corner Suite. It was amazing. The sunken tub in the room was a wonderful experience. The housekeeping staff were friendly and helpful. We will return in the future.
50,The Luxor is a beautiful place when I walked in there I am in total awe we go here every year hoping to get back there ASAP...we are from New York and it is an amazing experience to go here..pool is gorgeous
10,What can I say.. this hotel is dirty and smells like a sewage pond. With the level customer care coupled with then cleanliness Super 8 and Motel 6 crank out a better product! MGM should be ashamed to advertise this hotel as apart of the group
10,"Housekeeping barged in first morning and last morning of stay despite Do Not Disturb sign. Fiance and I naked in bed asleep until we hear housekeep come into the room simultaneously while knocking NO APOLOGY WHEN SHE SAW US IN BED. We had no time to get up to answer the door and felt violated especially the morning we were leaving and had chosen 3pm checkout only to have housekeeping come in at 11am AGAIN NO APOLOGY AND REFUSED TO ACKNOWLEDGE HER MISTAKE WHEN CONFRONTED BY MY FIANCE IN THE HALLWAY. We learned after calling that their deadbolt to the door was by lifting the handle and that staff needed to do a wellness check after 3 days. Wellness checks can be done without barging into the room and we had clearly talked to staff the day before leaving to set up late check out. Wellness check was bull.  We stayed at this hotel because it was close to my sister's wedding venue as well as the MLife discount and familiarity (I stayed last October 2021 for bachelorette).  We talked to floor manager who apologized and gave a sob story about difficulty of communicating with non English speaking staff and the volume of staff per floor as someone who had a stranger walk in on them naked I don't give a hoot what your issues are as management. This should not happen. He gave us one meal voucher each and said he'd take it up to higher management.  We talked again to front desk manager to see if our situation was even mentioned or swept under the rug. That was when we told about the ""Wellness Check"" which is bull as I said we talked to staff the day before leaving to set up Late check out we don't need housekeeping coming in while we're still asleep naked in bed under the guise of a ""Wellness check"" that can be performed a multitude of ways that still respected clients privacy and dignity. We might have been awake at 11am if we could sleep on the card board mattresses provided which is another ridiculous charateristic about this ""lovely"" hotel. This hotel was a joke. My fiance tried to convince me to stay at a different hotel but it seemed like the Luxor would be fine until we both stayed here recently. We were waived our Late check out fee and resort fees during out stay after complaining to the front desk. Honestly should have escalated to get the days we were intruded on waived the very least. There is no pay off fee for being violated as we were. I will never stay at the Luxor again and will go on every internet platform to speak the truth of this experience as well as warn friends and family members. (April 2022)"
40,Put towels down on the bathroom floor before showering in a pyramid room lol. There’s half a shower door and the floors get soaked. Amazing water pressure though. The restaurants are good. Blue man group is amazing. As is the bodies exhibit. Last time we stayed it was in a tower suite. It was nice. The elevators suck though. Half of them don’t read room keys.
50,Great experience for my first time in Las Vegas . Hotel room was clean. Wanted a better view of the stripe but that was ok . Staff were nice and professional at all times. Would stay here again. Pool area was nice also
50,Plenty of parkingeasy checking and great room and pool. Lots of friendly employees to help with any questions that you may have concerning the many property advantages. Tons of new slot games to enjoy and some old favorites.
10,This is a very old hotel . Uncomfortable beds the AC units are at least 25 years old. No circulation smell of smoke inside the rooms from the casino. No coffee makers or refrigerators in the room. Beds are small and uncomfortable. Stay somewhere else.
50,Our room was in the pyramid on 26th floor with a fantastic view. I have to admit that we had no problems with the elevator but the incline is a bit scary. Everywhere was spotless there seemed to be constant cleaning going on in all the communal areas and our room was cleaned every day even though we would have been happy with every other day. Check in was busy and we had flown in from the UK and arrived about 11 thinking we’d have to wait until 3 o’clock to check in but our room was ready and no issue checking in early and no extra cost. The bars and eateries we used during our stay were all good it was a really great week.
20,"Many of the staff are not welcoming and seem miserable working for the company; that made me feel very uncomfortable.    The room I stayed in had a shower with only one door which made it hazardous to even freshen up. You must be careful as there will be standing water on the bathroom floor after you take a shower. I asked a lady at the front desk if the uni-door showers were standard and she replied ""Yeah it's s####y design right?!""."
50,Stayed at Luxor for 3 nights. Staff and hotel are awesome. Casino floor is layout is nice. Short walk to everything you need. Fantasy show is classy and upscale! Highly recommend!! Casino floor staff are awesome and very helpful. Waitresses are beautiful and very quick. Room prices at the Luxor are great and provide excellent value. I will be coming back to the Luxor in the future. Thank you to the staff at the Luxor!!!
20,Had to stay here for my daughter's volleyball event with her team. We got a corner suite and standard king room for my daughter. They told us they could be ajoining when we booked but when we arrive they put my daughter on a seperate floor. After complaining they moved her to the same floor but opposite side of the hotel. Corner suite has a very odd layout and most square footage is a waste of space. Bathtub in the room near the bed is weird...tub was dirty faucets corroded. Bathroom was not well appionted. One bar of soap. Wife could not teach the toilet paper from the toilet. No towel hanger within reach of the shower. Window tint was pealing off and missing on part of the window. Previous guests dirty socks were left on the floor. Will not stay here again.
40,Everything was fine until I got stuck on one of the elevators. That wasn’t cool at all. I thought the bed would be changed and that didn’t happen. The elevators need to be fix for a smoother ride I know it’s a pyramid.
50,Friendly staff great location very clean. Greeted by staff in the lobby and eager to tell you the best things to do Ike in Vegas! Casino was very lively and great atmosphere. Food and drink options were great
40,The location was good. Just wished there were more food options in the hotel and that they offered a fridge to keep drinks and food cold. A microwave would have been great as well since we often had leftovers.
40,The hotel staff was excellent and accomodating. I had made an error on my reservation which they were happy to correct without an issue. Check in was really easy and so was the express check out. Room was always clean. The Pyramid rooms are showing their age but I was told the Tower rooms have been updated.
10,Horrible service and poor rooms……find another hotel as this hotel needs renovation. Very poor service at check in and no refrigerators. Don’t choose this property. What else can I say? Poor customer service inclinators are very long waits
20,It was nice until the hold Luxor places on my card. I checked out 4/5/22 and my card was charged as well as another hold of over $700 was placed on my card that same day. I called the front desk and they did not want to help me resolve this issue.
30,I just wish the staff had better communication skills. I felt like anytime I needed to talk to staff I burdened them. Good customer service skills would help this place a lot. Also I would appreciate better signage to get from self parking to check In. And communicate on what we have access to and what we don’t .
50,Stayed here during an absolutely busy ( therefore expensive) weekend to celebrate my dad's 70th bday. Check in was long and next time would probably opt for priority if it was again but it went quick and great service. Our rooms were great (we haven't been there since the remodeled rooms and it was so nice). Much lighter feel to the room. Comfy beds and all you need in a room (besides a fridge but are available) we love the pool area and everything about the Luxor. Like everywhere pool drinks bar drinks food etc is pricey. Sign up for rewards and book through Mgm allowed to add options and get their best rate.  We will stay again!
10,Parking fee resort fee etc all added up to be much more than the room itself costs.    And the Stay Well room we had came with nothing… no microwave mini fridge or even a coffee maker.    Was put in a room we didn’t order and it wasn’t cleaned.    The next room was nice and cool then in the night the heater kicked on and ran nonstop all night. We had to leave our door wide open because it was so hot.
40,The Luxor is one of the older hotels in Vegas. Despite its age the rooms are clean and comfortable and the facilities are more than adequate. The buffet is top notch and the cafe serves good portions.
50,The Luxor Hotel is a great place to stay for children and adults. Fair prices easy to navigate and fun atmosphere! Dining options were great with not only the restaurants but also with the food court.
40,Overall my trip to the Luxor was fantastic we had small minor issues with our keys not working more than once however the rooms were clean and for the most part the staff is friendly. Not too far from the airport. We really did enjoy ourselves
40,Very very cool place to stay! Would recommend renting a bed at the pool area and enjoying the sun!!! Starbucks on site actually two Starbucks on site! Good food at the food court. Recommend the pizza place there. Go see Carrot Top!! That was the best show I saw in Vegas!
40,The room was nice. There was no fridge microwave or coffee pot in the room. The air conditioner did not cool the room very well. Swimming pool area was fun but the drinks are very pricey! We probably would stay again but would check air conditioning first!
50,For a budget MGM property you get your moneys worth and more! The pools are amazing! Staff awesome! I love staying here every time I come to Vegas. The only con wittily be the elevators but that isn’t eight for someone not to stay here.
10,MGM has changed their resort fees. All of the SUPPORT I GAVE them during covid meant nothing. They are a big corporation that is nothing but greedy asses. The resort fees are just stupid and no comp nights for my level. Dont go!!!
50,I had a great time...it is well worth being a gold member. The rooms are clean and modern enough. I had never stayed in the Pyramid before I usually do the Towers but I was pleasantly surprised. I definitely recommend.
10,Staff was very unfriendly. Check in was a nightmare took me over an hour to get a key for my room. The very last day a man walked into my room with a key they gave some random person a key to my room thinking it was empty. Terrible all around. I will not be going back.
10,Horrible old outdated hotel with scary balconies on each floor. Kids could climb over to their u timely death. Food was very overpriced. Housekeeping staff were never warm and friendly. Timeshare people always harassing you each time u walk through the lobby.
30,There is lots of walking required and the cost of renting electric scooters is rather high. These are necessary for many of us seniors especially with medical problems that restrict our ability to walk.  Also the Buffet was either closed all day or closed early on some days. The cost of food at the Food Court is very high. Unless you rent a car you are at their mercy and must pay the very high prices. One meal for two at the Mexican Restaurant was over $100 for two people with tip. (One mixed drink in that order)
50,Stayed here only for one day I would recommend Luxor since it has connection in between to Mandalay Bay and Excalibur casino. Great friendly staff. Must try Buffett. This was short trip but made it excellent stay due to the fact it was less crowded due to trip was middle of the week. MUST sign up for mgm rewards
30,There was an issue at check in where that took far too long then on the second night my key didn't work so I had to get back into the check in line to be directed to another line just to correct their glitch and get some sleep. Otherwise nothing special about the room plain jane bathroom expected more since I've had better in the same area for cheaper.
50,We ended up staying due to flight cancellation from Spirit (never again!!!). The staff of the Luxor showed what customer service should be. From the time we checked in until the time we departed we were taken care of
40,The MGM rewards were slow to have my status updated I ended up having to pay for parking was woken up at 2:00 a.m. in the morning with my lady in our child for a remote control that actually works I had requested the remote around 10:00 p.m. and they took it upon themselves to take 4 hours to get this resolved which I was already in bed sleeping
50,The Luxor has a hilarious charm to it. The obvious over the top Egyptian theme is one thing but the elevators are also a relic from old vegas that haven't been updated in maybe 40 years so they're historic! The Tower rooms are incredibly nice. The trim and decorations are eye catching and the amenities are pretty luxurious (bath tub and shower). The Buffet was good eating and the taxi service entrance was always staffed. Even the basic rooms are decent and serve their purpose well.
40,Check in - Check out a breeze. Room was great but would like to see a single serve coffee maker added to help start the day. Elevators (4B) need a little refreshing. Great value. Will stay again.
50,Visited for March Madness weekend! Room was perfect for what we needed. Plenty of food options. Quick walk through the casino to Mandalay Bay. Bathroom super clean. A lot of excitement around the casino!
30,I don't like walking through an entire Casino with smoke to get to and from my room. If you have sensory issues this wont work for you. The rooms were clean and quite. I love the quite part. But the amenities are minimal. I dislike that every amenity has to be purchased as an extra and there is limited internet.  Best part is that the rooms were clean and quite despite some permanent stains on tiles. Clean and quite is very important for sensitive sensory people.
50,easy check in and friendly customer service and very helpfull rooms where clean and big variety of food and gift shops liked that it was connected to other casinos didn't have to leave hotel. over all I was very happy with Luxor and told my family & friends that this is the Hotel I will always stay in.
50,Initially we were placed on a room on the first floor but when we went to get my wife a room key a very nice lady at the front desk moved us to the 8th floor. She also noticed it was my birthday and provided us the 2 free toast drinks. We never looked back after that!
40,The elevators and the pyramid rooms need updates but overall the experience was good. It’s a very cool place to stay. You really get the feel the whole pyramid theme on the atrium level. Unfortunately the pool was still closed for the season when we were there but we were allowed to use the Mandalay Bay pool for free so that was fine. Overall we enjoyed it.
50,The food in the cafe was excellent and the staff that we’re working were friendly and helpful the room was comfy and clean the pool side was relaxing and loved the music and drinks it was differently a great get away i will be going back and staying at the Luxor
50,My visit at the Luxor was very relaxing and entertaining the staff are friendly and insightful and I was very impressed with the Titanic exhibit .Also the room was very spacious and comfortable the food served at the cafe's was well prepared and deliciousand there is plenty of slot machines to choose from.All in all a great place to stay when in Vegas.
50,Our favorite place to stay in Vegas. Rooms are clean and updated. The suites are wonderful. We get the best comps from Luxor. The staff is very friendly and helpful. Valet service is wonderful. The Tender Steakhouse is phenomenal.
50,Luxor hotel was great. Would definitely stay there again. Clean rooms and friendly staff Location was great also. Had a Tower room with a great view. Had my first facial and will Definitely do it again
50,Great location and loved being connected to other hotels. The only thing is that we wish they still had the coffee pots/microwaves/refrigerators in the room.  Check in was a very easy process.  Had breakfast in the hotel and it was very good!  Would recommend this hotel.
40,It was very good We really enjoyed our stay and felt we were near everything. The room was comfortable and spacious. Whenever we needed anything they were right there to help us. The check in and check out were simple and easy
50,Very nice but  Long walk to elevator and no fridge in room.  Had left overs from dinner and when we got back to room realized we had no place to put them. Check I /out very easy.  Staff and personnel very friendly.
50,I stayed at Luxor during Grammy weekend. Friendly staff great shows nice casino and centrally located. The rideshare pick up are is very organized. I experienced a flight delay so the bell/luggage staff conveniently stored my luggage until my available flight. It was a very organized process as well.
50,I love that hotel. It was clean and the room was cozy . Clean hotel . I will definitely go back and refer other there. Lots to do there and the staff was very accommodating toe and my guest  They had fun as well
50,"Very nice stay front desk check in went above and beyond to give me that special room and the restaurant we had breakfast in the waiter that only brought our drinks was sooo ""cool"" it was the perfect place to celebrate my birthday with some family"
20,Room was dirty (an old sock on the floor when we checked in). Building wrap blocked natural light and views. Beds the softest I have ever encountered. Pet policy pretty much prevented us using the facilities provided under the “resort fee”
50,Was An amazing stay went in march for bad bunny made check in and check out super easy by the app. Valet was super easy everything was amazing! 10/10 for it being my first time staying at the Luxor i will definitely be going back.
50,Always stay at Luxor when I go to Vegas. My go to place. The staff is accommodating and the atmosphere is inviting. The rooms are comfortable but who stay in their room when in Vegas. Must go to Tenders restaurant excellent.
50,Room was very clean very quite very updated very comfortable. Food was great and plenty to pick from. Would be nice to have more affordable tabs Le games. We will be back thanks to the staff. Check in and out easy
50,I really enjoyed my stay at Luxor! Our room was perfect! We are going back to Vegas soon & hope to stay at Luxor. It is so convenient to everywhere. I had a great time in the casino. I want to go back to hang out at the pool
50,we had a nice time just the room was far for my spouse he has cancer and we had to leave a day early other wise we would have stayed are 3 days we hope to come back in June hopefully we get a room closer and on the first floor tks again
50,CCheck in was fast and they provided us with the rooms that we requested. Clean and great service love the Pyramid café and moderately priced. Use the tram from hotel to hotel and it was clean and great!
40,Luxor Pyramid King Room was clean orderly and in good repair. Most public areas were the same; however the weak part of maintenance are the overhangs of the floors above in the pyramid. This has to be a really difficult thing to maintain given the design of the structure.    The only problems I had were using the phone app to get in the room and to operate the inclinators. My encounters with the staff were all pleasant.
50,It was a very nice room with a comfortable bed. There was ease of traveling between the casinos without having to go outside. I used the app to checkout so it was painless. I would recommend this place for an economical value.
50,Check in was quick. Front desk were nice & friendly.  Housekeeper did an excellent good. Room was nice & clean.  Didn't have any problems with Parking.  And the pyramid Cafe was very delicious. Food was good
40,I have stayed at the Luxor at least three times now. The staff is always friendly and the room is nice for the price. This time we did not visit the pool at the Luxor because we could see it from our room and I never saw that the slide was open/in use. My family went to Mandalay Bay’s pool since our child was with us.
50,Stay was very nice felt very comfortable. Luxor is the place to visit and stay . My family always comes from California and stays at Luxor.  Rooms are very comfy and very clean employees are very helpful and nice.
50,Super clean and the employees were super friendly. Tender steak house was great and very convenient. Checking in was a breeze super helpful at the font counter. The spa was fantastic and super clean. I enjoyed everything there.
30,We stayed at the Luxor for my birthday. Since it was during the week we got a great deal on a premiere corner king suite with Fresh Stay. Fresh Stay is a cleanliness service offered at some MGM property rooms. It includes: an air purifier a device to purify your shower water a diffuser and special mattress. This room normally goes for upwards on $500 on the weekends. It was a great room for what we paid but it was not worth $500 a night. We had two broken lights and an issue with the soaking tub. Both issues were fixed and we received a credit so it was fine. Overall we had a great time
50,Fun time loved riding the sideways elevator. Lots to do inside the hotel. Lots of interesting artifacts including the titanic and bodies. Had fun gambling in the casino. Wasn't too fond of the people from the timeshare company that has a set up inside the lobby.
50,Mgm rewards treated me well. The luxor meet or exceeded all of my needs. The digital card worked out well. I never had to wait in line.  The location wasn't the greatest although the tram made it manageable. I definitely would stay there again in the future.
30,Good location although a bit south on the Strip. Pyramid room and elevator ride to get there were cool. Room is lacking in amenities though. No microfridge bath mat or cups only one trashcan and three hangers. TV had to be physically plugged/unplugged from wall to get it to work bathroom light bulb out COVID mask behind TV stand and bottle cap under it. Great check-in experience though and appreciated the bell service holding our luggage on the last day.
50,It was my first time staying at the Luxor. The staff was incredible and it was a very wonderful experience. I will be going back to stay again. I would highly recommend this casino. And I have no complaints whatsoever.
50,Nice room. We had a corner suite which was huge. Great location on the strip. Food court prices way too high. Nice pool area. Didn't like the fact that the buffet serves a breakfast/brunch daily for $40 when 3 years ago you could go there for breakfast fo $20.
50,Always enjoy Vegas we go 1 to 2 times a year was there twice during covid had fun but this trip was back to how I know Vegas can't wait to plan my next trip!! The Luxor is one of my favorite places to stay the staff and there hospitality was top notch!!
50,So easy to sleep. Such a comfortable bed with no outside noise. So close to the convention center and convenient to the casino. The Egyptian decor everywhere was so fitting to the theme. Much better than other casinos. Diablos ROCKED!
50,We love the Luxor always get a upgrade to a Tower 1 Bedroom suite with our M Life Status. Food is amazing and having a M Life Black Card they valet your car an park it right up front. Never a need to stay anywhere else and we get use of the Limo as well and being a Noir an Black Card we get to play Shadow Creek as well. This is the finest golf course in the world bar none.    Kevin an Leslie  Aspen Colorado
50,Everything was great. Only thing I miss is fridge and microwave in room. But none of hotels on strip have them. Food too expensive but not hotels fault. Don't like resort fees. But there again all hotels have them
40,The view wasn't exactly the best (the side of a building to be exact) and it did have a particular odor that wasn't great but the bed was nice room was clean check in and out process was super easy. We also quite enjoyed our meal at Diablo. Highly recommend dining there.
30,"I'd been looking forward to this trip for two years but had to postpone because of Covid. Every single staff member I encountered was amazing. The room is just so-so very basic with no fridge microwave or coffee maker in the room. For an Egyptian themed hotel there is nothing in the room to indicate such. We had a Pyramid Premier two queen room & the first room they assigned me to hadn't been cleaned when we got there. It took three calls and 45 minutes to get moved to another room but that issue was resolved. A lot of the shops and restaurants aren't open or are only open certain days. Someone tore off the face of the Pepsi machine Monday night and when we left Friday morning it still hadn't been fixed. The common areas of the hotel are beautiful really great. The pool is open now but only until 6pm. It would have been nice to swim in the evening after a long day of running around seeing the sights. All in all this was just an ""okay"" stay. I wanted - no expected - more than okay. And I'm really not sure what that $35 a day resort fee is for."
10,Our room was broken into while we stayed there over $6000 worth of items were taken out of our room they broke into the room with a screwdriver or a prybar to pry open the door clothes electronics jewelry was taken they even took the safe out of the room hotel management did nothing to compensate us all they did was move us to a different room and offer us $100 food voucher this is the worst experience we’ve ever had in all of our years coming to Las Vegas
30,"This Casino is a big place. It seemed like it was a long way to go to get anywhere within the casino. The rooms were pricey and the beds too soft. Oh and there was not a mini-fridge in the room. Shouldn't that be part of the ""Resort Fee"" ???"
20,Outdated- It is located too far down the strip for no room service and no concierge. There was however a timeshare stand. We literally went to registration counter and bell hop stand to information that varied depending on who you asked. There was not enough outlets no refrigerator microwave coffee marker or light in the room. The signs for the buffet open days were confusing.
10,Awful. Awful. Bathroom was dirty when we got to the room. On hold for 15+ minutes to have someone come clean it. No one ever picked up the phone. On my way down I ran into a housekeeper and she radioed to have someone come clean it. They did. But the water never stopped running. Hot water tan constantly causing humidity and condensation in our entire room. We were there for 2 nights but other vacation plans afterwards and our clothes were all damp. Purchased Lush bath bombs from the store there in the hotel. Ruined. Eyeshadows ruined. When I checked out they offered to remove the resort fee for one night. Not satisfactory at all. Will never stay here again nor will I encourage friends to stay here.
50,I have stayed at Luxor many times and they never dissappoint. the Luxor cafe is a wonderful way to start the day staff is friendly and the service is great. Beds are comfortable and rooms have always been clean.
30,Normally we have a good time at the Luxor but not this time! From check in with the rude agent to the shower only having one door on the pyramid side which water splashed all over the floor and housekeeping walking in the room without knocking it just wasn't what we are accustomed to at the Luxor!
20,Was listed as a location for stay-to-play hockey tournament for kids. The Luxor is not kid friendly. We were placed on the second floor and all our personal items smelled of smoke within 24hrs of our arrival. We had problems with the TV and called multiple times for repair and the only time anyone showed was around 10:30 pm when my kid was asleep.
10,Not a great place to stay casino smells like an ashtray room are not good loud and uncomfortable  quality of food was as poor as you can get. Elevators are dirty as is the entire casino shower missing a door water presure out of control felt like you were getting pumitted with a fire hose
10,Decided to put me in the tower and called it an upgrade. I asked to have my room changed even when I was booked weeks in advance. I wanted to stay in the pyramid and told me there was nothing they could do
30,Checking in day one was a nightmare. App wasn’t working properly for anyone to be able to go through mobile-check in. Room was clean upon arrival however bathroom needs serious makeover..it’s 2022! There were a few items in the room that did not work such as the phone an a few of the lamps. Thankfully we had cell service in case of an emergency. Overall it was just ok.
30,The hotel room was large and comfortable but the bathroom provided no towel racks at all and the vent in the bathroom was very loud and ineffective so that the mirror fogged up completely on every shower. The MGM Rewards desk always had a very long line with only one person servicing the entire line and we could not find out how to take advantage of any rewards we earned while there.
10,The room on the first floor is horrible they shouldn’t even be given out to the guest even for free it feels like jail and depressing.We paid $151 for the weekend and with $30 valet parking for the worst experience stay in Vegas. I will never come back here again.
50,Because the Luxor is at the start of the Vegas strip it is often overlooked. It’s a great hotel that’s cleverly designed with all the rooms on the exterior of the building enabling every patron to have a view. And the interior is filled with enough Egyptian decor to keep it interesting while the restaurants and theaters are easily accessed away from the casino on another floor which makes it great for families. And the INCLINATOR (45 degree angle) elevators are an unusual and interesting thing to ride. I brought my teenage boys here and they enjoyed it!
20,When we checked in the room smelled like cigarette smoke and weed. Switch to new room and it smelled like a gallon of fabuloso had been spilled on the carpet. If you have allergies or sensitivity to smelled these are not for you
30,Room was fine but nothing special front desk was woefully understaffed. I flew in late got to the hotel at 2am and had to stand in line for an hour because I had the wrong confirmation code to use the app. No way I could have known that until the front desk person told me. Towels were scratchy and tiny. No refrigerator in the room to have cold drinks. Restaurants were nothing special.
50,This is my 28th visit to Vegas and 3rd stay at the Luxor. I have stayed in most hotels on the strip and for the money you pay this hotel is by far the best. Yes you have to pay to park your car now….a shame we had to drop ours off to save this charge but our choice. The room we have in the pyramid on the 15th floor is well presented clean and very well serviced by housekeeping everyday. The beds are comfortable the shower pressure is incredible and the air con works well. I’m still amazed at the sound proofing in this hotel too no noise from the casino below and very little noise from any other rooms.  I have no idea if all rooms are the same level of cleanliness as comfort as ours but if they are I have no idea what people find to moan about this place.  Yes people smoke and it’s clings to the carpets and walls in the hallways but that’s vegas for you. Yes the smell from the drains does sometimes permeate the casino but it wasn’t bad enough to stop me sitting in it.  If you want a good base for a decent price the Luxor is much improved and we can’t fault it.
50,The Luxor Hotel and Casino is still among the best get-away properties in Las Vegas! Friendly and professional staff awaits anyone traveling to Vegas. Room options are more than reasonable. Highly recommend to everyone traveling to Las Vegas for any reason!
50,From the moment you walk through the front doors you are Immersed in the Egypt vibe. The Hotel is the perfect blend of theming and luxury that I have experienced in Vegas. The rooms are awesome as well. The beds are comfortable the bathroom is amazing and the room itself was very nice and well kept
20,$300 for 1 night and it wasn't any better than a standard Holiday Inn... The rooms were mediocre at best. They put the room on sale but then more than made up the difference charging double resort fees and $12-$24 every time you want to drive out of the parking garage.
10,Had to stay here for a volleyball tournament. The staff was friendly and helpful but otherwise the it’s very disappointing. The a/c was terrible the building looks old tired and grungy. It’s too Smokey.
10,This was an awful experience from beginning to end. Had to move rooms due to maintenance problems. Cocktail server rude. Room was broken into items stolen no responsibility from hotel. Security rude. Never will I stay at this hotel again
10,Room was dirty not messy but tables were dusty. A room above ours had a leak and we were woken up about 1:30 AM during one of the nights we were there to check something in our room after we had already been called and we confirmed there was no issue in our room. After looking past all this we wanted to stay another night as me and my husband were on our honeymoon we spoke to the front desk and since we were going to use a different card we went down to guest services and were then told they couldn’t help us since the floor we were on was getting shut down for maintenance. We asked to add a night and just give us a different room that would be available and we were told they couldn’t help us and would need to book through a third party app we had used. Terrible service and dirty rooms.
30,Missing a mini fridge and microwave. very small trash cans. TV turns on VERY loud! So I turned the volume down and left it on while I left the room. My phone was too large for the elevator floor auth.
10,"Mattress sagged room would not cool off due to ineffective air conditioning room had a smell it wasn't an odor so much as just an ""old smell"".    I am very disappointed with the level of cleanliness and overall quality of this location. I am not sure how a hotel on the strip can be this old and tired.    I was embarrassed when my friend came by from her hotel and Mandalay Bay."
10,Dirty hotel. No one appeared to know anything when we asked questions. Very rude customer service from entire staff. Dirty room. Air conditioner from midnight to 6am was hot. Called downstairs no one ever answered.
10,"The primary reason for a low score is the incredibly loud emergency ""pre-alert"" that went off at 3am for about 20 minutes (not exaggerating) ""This is the hotel pre-alert system..."" stopped for 5 minutes then blared again for one minute. It concluded with ""this alarm was triggered by a minor incident."" That was the explanation. No other communication.    This alarm terrified me! In this day and age where mass shootings occur in Vegas schools churches any location this type of alarm strikes terror in a person and your mind starts imaging all sorts of terrible situations a shooting a fire an airplane crashing into the hotel the hotel buckling in because it's so old etc.    We were in Vegas for a youth volleyball tournament and I was scared for the hotel full of young girls and their families. I was terrified for the safety of my children.  I changed into my street clothes grabbed my most valuable items and started to plan next steps which included going to a different hotel.    After the alarm stopped I couldn't fall asleep for another hour because I was so amped up. I had booked 4 nights 3 for the tournament and one more to visit Vegas. Instead after the tournament ended I went to the front desk to ask about the emergency alert. When I explained what happened one hotel employee offered to comp the resort fees. I asked for at least a comp of the room charge for that Saturday night. A different employee offered to comp the lowest room fee of my stay. I asked to speak to a manager. Every time I explained what happened no one acted as if this was an unusual situation. No one seemed concerned about the mental anguish it caused me or any other hotels guests. The manager comped my Saturday night room fee let me cancel my 4th night without penalty but did not behave as if this was truly a problem.    I happened to google Luxor hotel and emergency alert and I found comments on two websites describing the same emergency alert madness occurring at the same time 3:00am in 2011 and 2018.    I spoke with a hotel employee who has been working at the Luxor for many years and this employee said this has been going on for decades!  I can't understand why MGM hasn't fixed this glitch in Luxor's alarm system. One day someone will have a heart attack or a severe panic attach due to this false alarm."
40,Ok room was clean good beds fairly quiet. No coffee in the room and no mini fridge and long coffee lines for expensive Starbucks. Also 3 green on Roulette wheel making it even harder to win. but I still love roullette. Hate slots I can't understand.
20,The first thing you notice is the entire building smells like a dive-bar's kitchen: old greasy cigarettes. You will notice it most after leaving to go to Mandalay and returning. I had a $2500 laptop stolen from my room. When we returned the door was wide open because the closer did not work (so I likely did not latch it completely when we left I'll admit that possibility and take responsibility for not checking). After filing the police report we realized there are no cameras anywhere to even possibly catch the thief. The police officer said that the Luxor typically does not cooperate with police anyway and does not allow them to review footage even if there were any. The only thing good about this resort is the cool architecture.
50,Wonderful resort for a gathering of friends. Walking distance to other area attractions. Great food. Wonderful staff in all departments. Staff was great helping us to better understand the table games.
40,Great game room floor spacious area area great places to eat. Room was lovely minus a Mini refrigerator wish that I had known that prior to booking. Other than that it was a wonderful day wish we had more time to play
30,No refrigerator no microwave no coffee pot or Keurig. Plan on waiting in a LONG line at Starbucks if you are a coffee drinker because they are super busy. Rooms are clean bathrooms are nice but nothing impressive.
10,From digital key cards not working in elevator/room to the sewage smell throughout gaming floor. Thermostat was set to 68 before bed and would automatically go up to 74 in middle of night. Terrible food at Tender steakhouse for a $200 tab for two.
40,Had a very nice vacation for an anniversary. We were on a tight budget but wanted to do something. The Luxor was perfect affordable and friendly. Staff was helpful as expected and it was clean for what you would expect.
20,Unpacked my luggage opened the top dresser drawer and there were panties left behind. Took probably 30 min to find someone remove and sanitize. I’m not touching someone else’s drawls!! This was my first time staying at the Luxor too.
50,We were amazed with how quiet and comfortable the rooms were. Came for a simply couples trip and we are already planning our next trip to come back. The Luxor was clean and super on brand with it's theme throughout the entire hotel.
50,OK if you read my reviews from around the world you know they are very honest. I am never paid to do them.    That said the place is awesome which is very rare.  Most casinos smell like death. Old stale smoke and spilt alcohol pours out from the carpet and walls. NOT AT THE LUXOR.  It is nice and clean. Rooms are wonderful.  We stayed in the East tower which was a wow. The higher the better.
10,"my truck was vandalized in the hotel parking lot and the staff basically told me they're not at fault because they don't have liability for ""my"" property. I would have expected them to have better security to prevent this in the first place."
40,Was disappointed there was not a refrigerator in the room. Was also difficult to use my iphone as a key card to get the elevator to work sometimes. Other than that I had a good stay - mobile check-in was very convenient.
50,This was my first stay at the Luxor and my family's first visit to Vegas. Staying in the pyramid was a unique experience. I thought the room was great though I have read that the rooms in the tower are more modern we wanted the pyramid experience. The resort staff accommodated our request for adjoining rooms though it mean we couldn't check in early.
40,"We had a great time at the Luxor. Room was always clean upon our return. Most casinos are hard to ""manage"" getting around and you tend to get lost just trying to find the way back to your room... not so here very well set up... loved the location being at the end of the strip. Only had one issue at the bar basically accusing me of trying to ""cheat to get the comp alcohol"" .. problem was not resolved and no apology was given ... other than that ... had a great time and and great stay"
10,Staff was very slow checking us in  you did not have the room i reserved  smoking in the casino  Room and hallway had a bad smell  outside of room was looking at back of heating system  TV did not work  Elevators were slow and bumpy  had to walk all the way across the casino to get to elevator
50,I stayed on the 15 floor of the east tower and trip was uneventful. I didn't have any issues with the hotel. There are many places to shop and eat within walking distance. My stay was as friendly and confortable.
20,Needs to upgrade hotel amenities and lower the price. There are much better hotels tat a cheaper rate on the strip. The hotel style is really old. However the buffet is worth it. The pool is really nice also. Traveling is also convenient
10,No one was available to check me out. I was forced by staff to checkout on table and was not provided a detail receipt that was promised to be emailed to me. Guess what? I was over charged!  Room was dirty and smelled like Body Odor.
50,Friendly staff. Amazing architecture. Engineering marvel elevators. Fascinating exhibits. Buffet decor that almost distracts you from the food. Fun swimming pools. I’ve always wanted to stay at the Luxor and it did not disappoint. Full 10 out of 10! And I’m a regular Vegas visitor. Definitely going to stay there again.
10,The phone application for using your device as a key was terrible it only worked about one out of three times and you have to hold the phone in one hand and press the floor button with the other hand or it would not work which is fine if you aren’t carrying anything. I rode the elevator up and down several times before anyone could make it work. They told me to go get a key printed at the front desk. So much for skipping the line. When I needed to leave a day sooner than previously planned the same as my colleague they did not charge him for the last day but I was charged. I was told that since I tried to checkout using the app and then called the front desk while we were driving they told me I can to come to the front desk and see what they could do which was not possible with my current situation so much for a system that limits COVID exposure. MAJOR FAIL!
20,They overbooked my room and I had to settle for a lessor room way away from my group. They simply didn't have any when I got there even though I booked over a month in advance! Also no fridge or microwave. And the bed was broken or something. It was hard to sleep due to the mattress.
40,After a long hectic day of travel it was nice to have a very easy check in and check out. Staff was very friendly and accommodating. Great variety of food and playing tables. The Americas Got Talent show was amazing as well.
50,Hotel was nice. Staff was great. Enjoyed the buffet except the orange juice and hot chocolate didn't taste right. Didn't do any gambling because the house always win. Gave a great deal for an extra day stay. Overall great stay.
30,The hotel was nice until staff walked into our room with out our permission 3 times it was an invasion of privacy and honestly scary to know they feel they can walk in at any time. When we complained no one seemed to care Ans nothing was done about it
10,The shower in the room is horrible because the shower head is so small and so low it didn’t cover my body. There was a guy blowing water on the patio below at 6:30am so I was awakened to that. The hotel hallways are falling apart. The AC and vent didn’t work properly so the room air was incredibly stale.
10,"If you drive in checkin is horrible. They close the pool and hot tubs at 6PM. WTF? Vegas closing the pool deck at 6PM? No coffee maker in the room so the two Starbucks downstairs have lines 40 people deep first thing in the morning. No fridge in the room I was told I had to upgrade. The room comes with a desk but the 60"" TV makes it useless."
20,"I'll keep it as short as I can:  No fridge  No movie channels  No guide on the tv to tell you what's on & when  The remote has limited buttons & the numbers kept sticking  No USB chargers in the room  No thermostat in the room just a dial to turn to ""cool"" (which is in the 70s)  The shower design is awful & water goes everywhere  The bathroom tissue is MAYBE 1/2 ply  No bathroom fan (is that a COVID thing)  Paid $11 in the little convenience shop for a soda & a sleeve of crackers  No shopping in the Luxor & no real shopping at the 2 adjacent hotels  You have to use your room key in the elevators & the little card readers are finicky & don't always work  Be prepared to sleep in a hole    Only pro is that it's on the south end of the strip so it's less than 15 min to a few places to shop a CVS and a Smith's grocery store. There's a deli on the casino level that makes a delicious cuban sandwich & crispy tots. I don't think the Starbucks in the casino made my coffee correctly one time."
40,Very cool hotel probably architecturally has the most cool factor on the strip. Rooms were very cozy & clean. We got great sleep. The wonkavators to get up to your rooms were really cool. Good selection of new games as well.
50,Exceptional staff food and casino resort! The cost is on point my stay in Vegas was for vacation experience not breaking the bank and the Luxor surely delivered this for my friends whom it was the first time for one of them and we are planning to head back very soon!
40,The overall location is good with the property being clean and easy to navigate. The food court provides many options for late night eating though a little pricey for my taste. Overall a nice experience.
20,Staff is friendly enough but this place is in need of a makeover carpet is worn to the bone & rolling up in places litter all throughout the resort inside and out and they shouldn’t charge hotel guests for parking it’s outrageous.
40,I had not been to Vegas in several years and was slightly reluctant to go but I was attending a wedding of close friends and wanted to celebrate with them on their special day. The Luxor was a nice re-introduction to Vegas and I was pleased with my stay and accommodations and service.
10,"Our room was flooded by the bathroom above us and your customer service is terrible to the point you made my wife cry. With exception to a nice few the security guard bellman and maintenance man your employees have attitudes and don't do give a darn about us. I have never heard of blaming the customer as a good strategy for hotel management. I would love to hear how manager Chris Wells studied that in his training. You always hear about how management goes above and beyond when something happens on their watch that was completely the hotel's fault (in this case a bad patch on an old jacuzzi) but this is not Chris Wells' hospitality style. He did the absolute bare minimum which was move us to an equal room and clean our drenched clothes. The big issue here was my daughter's shoes. She only brought on pair and one of her shoes was completely soaked which your staff took away for day leaving her with no shoes! What would have been appropriate here would have been for him to waive the resort fees to help offset the cost of replacing her shoes. Instead he was combative. If you record the hotel phone calls with employees please find my wife's call and you will see what really happened. Here your hotel caused us harm and ruined a day of our vacation and he puts in the notes which was clearly read back to us by every customer care representative that ""Your wife hung up on us"". My wife did not hang up on you you just have cruddy cell phone coverage in your hotel. The cell phone connection was so bad that my wife and supervisor Chris could barely hear each other at times. She did not hang up on him because she still needed to confirm the new room number and when it was ok to move told if our rollaway bed needed to be taken to the new room or not whether she would be locked out of the room because she could not move all of our luggage in one trip and Chris also told her to call the off-site laundry place to ask for the order to be expedited and hadn't provided the phone number to call. Subsequently every customer care rep. did not want to help us because they think we hung up on them. I can assure you we did not cause wastewater to flood through the ceiling. Your hotel is old and crumbling and not fun to stay at. This is definitely the end of the super casino era. Also you can keep the MGM rewards card because they are incompetent as well. They still haven't sent a card in the mail and they created three duplicate accounts which made it almost impossible to get any rewards at the rewards desk. I would have put our entire stay on the card had I received it. I ordered it in February."
50,We have found a new love of the Luxor! Conveniently located and the staff across the board is so much nicer than other higher end hotels on the strip. Great restaurants and with the MGM Rewards you can go enjoy the food easily with free parking at those other MGM brand casinos that are too pretentious.
40,Decent price for accommodations and location. Near trams and good shows to choose from as well as clean several good restaurants and bars and great selection for all gambling types. Check in with the MGM app was convenient however the app for elevators and rooms was very sketchy and unreliable. There was option to get a hard key card and that worked fine. Hard to get drinks from staff while playing -far and few and would be nice to have coffee/tea/water to the very least in the rooms.
20,"I had a business package shipped to the Luxor. Turns the out Luxor Business Center was closed. Sign says to retrieve packages at the M Life desk but the M Life staff had no idea the sign said that and had no information on packages. Front desk staff didn't know where to begin looking promised to call me but didn't. They thought maybe it would be at Mandalay Bay but the Mandalay Bay staff (who were MUCH more informative) checked said it wasn't there and explained that sometimes the Luxor staff ""goes rogue"" and signs for packages and creates confusion.    I was at the Luxor for three nights. Package never found but worse nobody on staff worked with me from beginning to end track whether my issue was resolved. I just got the run-around walking from desk to desk to desk and standing in lines until I gave up."
50,I was exceptionally pleased with the staff and how friendly they all were. Was happy with the restaurants and the attractions like the Titanic. Also had a medical issue with my mom and the medical responders were there in minutes.
50,First time staying at Luxor at first was iffy about staying at the resort but it turned out well stuff was friendly and quite not much chaos and quick and rooms were clean would stay again at the penthouse
10,The whole place needs a facelift. Not worth the price AT ALL. so dirty and stuffy. So disappointing. Dirty stuffy unhelpful staff. Smells bad. Ceilings of hallways so dirty. Carpets everywhere are filthy.
50,As soon as we checked in we began have having fun! Our room location was a little far from the elevators but it was very quiet. We ate at the cafe for breakfast and it was delicious. we walked to Mandalay Bay which was very close. Had a great time!
50,Luxor is by far the best bang for your buck compared to any other hotel on the strip definitely worth checking out. The check in was quick and easy rooms were not far away and pretty nice staff was pleasant and friendly. Overall a great experience and will be back many times!
40,Luxor is a mega resort an old one and a comparatively low-end one. That should tell most travelers 90% of what they need to know about it. But in case it doesn’t I’ll tell you.    You can get service here the housekeepers do their job and greet you pleasantly but with 4000 rooms it’s not some cozy pampered experience. This place functions as a crash pad for people who spend most of their time gambling shopping eating and drinking and visiting shows and attractions.    In the pyramid where we stayed the Premier rooms are going to look better than standard rooms as they were remodeled recently. They’re not perfect. The furniture was repurposed from Ballagio apparently. The wardrobe in our room was functional but dinged up and the door stuck a bit. The bathroom looks good but the half glass shower wall isn’t adequate to contain the water so we had minor flooding daily.    The beds were comfortable but the duvets very thin and I folded it over double on mine (I was sleeping alone in a Queen).    I liked a lot about the room. The air conditioner was adequate and you could set the fan to run continuously which was perfect white noise. The room was relatively spacious. The teens loved the slanted windows and view of the atrium and the sense of life in a “triangle.”    We were on the 18th floor accessible only from elevator bank 3B which was 4 elevators serving 6 floors. We rarely waited more than one elevator typically only around 3-4 pm due to check-in time.    As with any Vegas mega resort you will have to walk a lot to get anywhere and do anything the place will smell like an ashtray (Park MGM is the exception) there may be lines and waits at peak times and workers may be busy when you want attention right now.    If this sounds like a poor fit there are many much much fancier and more luxurious options in this city. But Luxor isn’t trying to be that. It’s specifically designed for a low to midrange customer with equally minimal expectations on a budget.    The greatest thing about this resort is the obvious one. IT’S A HUGE PYRAMID and you can stay in it. That’s a totally unique feature you’ll never find anywhere else. There have been rumors that it’s a maintenance nightmare and may not be around as long as its inspiration in Egypt so if your delicate desires and sensibilities can tolerate its imperfections you might want to try it sooner than later.    Personally I would never pay weekend prices in Las Vegas where most of the casino-resorts cost 4-10 times the Sunday-Thursday price. If I’m in town for the weekend I use loyalty points at a chain for those nights.    Speaking of which if you are a Hyatt loyalty member you can get automatic tier match with MGM Rewards. Depending on your Hyatt level and match this might get you some comp nights free parking for Pearl and above and waived resort fees for Gold and above. This was a BIG save for us. The value with these perks was amazing.    So many low reviews here are about individual expectations and prior research. Everyone expects every travel experience tailored to the nth degree to their preferences. Sorry but travel is rarely like that. What you want or need is different than what someone else wants or needs. If you don’t want a noisy in-your-face crowded tacky mass market experience then pick a nicer place.    Luxor is the Walmart level Carnival cruise level McDonald’s level Vegas option. (So is sister property Excalibur by the way). If you think that’s an insult consider they are all hugely successful businesses because they cater to the masses. If you don’t mind being part of that group come on over.
50,We went to the Luxor to play some games. Had a few different dealers but the best of them was Youngsil Sue Siordia. She created a fun and exciting environment for us at the Luxor Table Games. Thanks for the fun times Sue! We recommend that you go see her.
20,Hairs found along the tub side and bottom hair found on the bathroom floor and shower stall. Looked dusty in the tub along the edges like it hadn't been cleaned in a month or somwthing. The sheets looked white and clean but I was afraid to touch anything. Who knows if the room was ever cleaned at all - how could someone leave leftover hairs all over the bathroom. So gross... 😑
10,WORST STAY EVER!!!!! Room had to be changed due to broken sink and dirty bed sheets upon check in. New room sink was broken TV would cut in and out. On top of it all I was stuck in the elevator when trying to go up to my room 3 times in one night and my partner got stuck in the elevator 3 times in the morning trying to return to the room. The rooms were dirty seemed as if housekeeping never fully cleaned the room. The hot tub was broken and never got fixed.    Lynne (hotel manager) was great. She addressed the issues and tried everything she could to take care of us while the whole hotel/resort seems to be falling apart around you.    I will NEVER return to the Luxor or any MGM resort. I have never had such a horrible experience anywhere I have stayed. I will be staying elsewhere every time and when in Vegas I will spend my time and money at a place that actually knows how to run a hotel resort and casino.    I cannot imagine that the MGM has its name associated with Luxor. Really puts a bad taste in my mouth about them as a company and I truly cannot understand how America’s Got Talent is sponsored by Luxor. Guess the Luxor is trying everything it can to stay open since it is unimaginable that anyone would honestly want to stay there.
10,Was very unhappy I will never stay at this hotel  Again nor will I recommend this hotel to any family or friends . The staff were rude and did  Not care at all that one of the guest in our party was handicapped
50,Awesome service and staff! Great amenities! Great location for the trolly to pick up between the excaibur and the Luxor! Made it very convenient! I have and will choose the Luxor for a future stay! 👍🏽
20,I don’t think I would stay at this location again. There was a rude manager at the front desk and that was a lasting first impression. The air conditioning didn’t work in our bedroom and we got the run around on that so not such a good experience!
50,beautiful big clean room and so quiet! slept so well! staff friendly and helpful! fabulous pool and fitness center yet. great food choices and delicious buffet! loved that we could easily get to excalibur’s and mandalay bay. loved that it is on the strip but not in the middle of all the congestion. loved our stay!
50,Our suite was clean and spacious. There was a separate sitting area for privacy. Room had an oversized soaking tub and a refrigerator. Bathroom was spacious and clean. I would happily stay there again and recommend it for a fun and relaxing getaway.
50,I really enjoyed staying at the Luxor I liked the theme of the hotel and all the photos on the all and statues I also enjoyed the activities as well. I really would go back and stay at this hotel. I liked our room but the only thing I didn't like was that our room was on the 22nd floor but it was really nice. Our room was cleaned daily except for one day so I liked that
10,The Luxor hotel was horrible. It is very dark and the room was dark and dingy and furniture chipped. The bed was hard like bricks and the sheets felt like tissue paper. I was so uncomfortable and had to check out the very next day and get a refund. We moved hotels for the remainder of our stay. Would never recommend anyone staying here unless you are comfortable with motel room conditions.
40,I stayed in a pyramid room and it was starting to show some age. There have been updates but they didn’t update everything and it looks a little pieced together. The tower rooms are a lot nicer in my opinion. It’s still a great place to stay and the food and entertainment options are great.
20,First its way down the strip have to uber to get to Anything! although if you don't mind hiking you can get to excaliber and mandalay bay through the many tunnel like areas.There are no coffee makers or refrigerators in the rooms and they won't even give you shower gel just little hard bars soaps so cheap. The room smelled nice was definitely clean enough but overall not worth it and we will go elsewhere ( we have stayed at harrahs caesars flamingo etc ) and we like to try places this one we will give a soft pass it was not the worst but surely did not live up to what some had hyped. Staff were busy non existent long lines wherever we went and when you did get someone they were rude and busy and brushed us off the slots were not that great either. Food choices over priced poorly done. The cleaning people were the best courteous and good job was done. The room had only minature ice bucket and zero choices for on floor vending machines had to use credit card for 3.00 water would not take cash. Long lines to get in and out of elevators we are way under impressed. Sorry. Wish we could recommend but nope we like Flamingo better though its old and dated we got better treatment there and you could ask people questions etc.
10,Terrible check in process. Housekeepers will throw away your things. No refrigerator in rooms. Elevators are inconvenient and mobile app only works when it wants to work so good luck using it as a room key.  Would not recommend.
10,staff is rude and did not offer early check in saying the rooms were being cleaned for 3h how did they miss the nasty eyelash found in the room! we stayed at the pyramid suite but room was old and dirty will not recommend or stay there again. We managed to move to The Bellagio and had a great time.
10,I like Luxor. But the hotel has become old and tired. The restaurant choices are few. The steak restaurant Tender has minimized their menu compared to years ago and it simply just isn’t as good. The spa closes at 5pm now. During the day at many times I would count only three blackjack tables open. Blackjack was paying 6 to 5 the days of 3 to 2 payouts seem to be gone. It’s time that the Titanic exhibit Bodies and Carrot Top (terrible) go away. How many years have they all been there? I’ve lost count.
10,There was gross breach of privacy and security. Somebody (later on identified as a staff) went inside my room without my knowledge and permission AND with a DO NOT DISTURB sign on the door! There was no coffeemaker either!
40,I stayed at the Luxor recently for business. The check in staff was quick and efficient. The rooms were clean and the beds were comfortable. The rooms are a bit dated but for the price you can't beat the accomodations and the ease to go between the Luxor Mandalay Bay and Excalibur. All the shopping and food you could want for.
40,It was fantastic. I LOVE their beds. The view was nice. The room was very clean and comfortable. Oasis Spa is excellent. I tried 3 different services and they were some of the best spa treatments I've ever had (and I've had a bunch!).
10,Very poor overall atmosphere cleanliness. The hotel needs an update. I also didn’t like that smoking is allowed in the Casino. Overall it just felt cheap.  The hotel was crowded and the entrance lacked a wow factor. Overstimulated by advertising verses impressed by design and customer service.
10,"The parking situation was ridiculous. We made special effort to select the Luxor hotel because we told our kids we were going to stay in a pyramid and wound up dragging all our luggage a quarter mile from the parking garage through and utter maze to stay in a tower with a view of nothing. Our great efforts to stay at your resort were a total waste of a night we had set aside special in Vegas.    Scott and Margo (not typically ""Karens"" but your resort was a low part of a wonderful trip}"
10,Paid for early check in didn't get to check in until almost 3 o'clock. Place is super dated and the wait staff was not great. Front Desk and BellDesk were very friendly but that was about it. One bedroom suite was good in the effect the bed was comfy and it was nice and big but other than that no thanks; its styled from like 40 years ago. Stayed the following 2 nights at Mandalay Bay...night and day difference in experience.
20,After a long flight from Newark 2nd part of holiday package. When arriving for check-in reception told us there was no room due to double booked offered upgrade room view at night darkness from view friends stayed in different room hassle free. Charged $333 dollars including security deposit ontop of resort fees. Male duty Manager useless poor customer service skills take it or leave it attitude mar 2022. We were 2 couples staying 2 different experiences
50,I had the greatest experience there at the Luxor. I was able to check in through my phone and did not have to stand in line to retrieve my room card or have to speak to nobody other than the nice lady worker that helped me find my room. I slept like a baby throughout the night The casino there was fun with a Lotta good atmosphere people. The check out was just as great same process over my phone and went about my way. Thank you Luxor.
50,We had an awesome time. Dining sleeping gaming value parking location were all great. I have nothing bad to say nor am I going to nitpick needlessly like the rest of the general public. I love Vegas for all that it is and appreciate the hospitality workers that make it all happen.
40,Very nice hotel but on end of strip so long bus rides or expensive can/Uber. And if traveling with others make sure stay on same floor because your room key/cards are needed for elevators & will only let you stop on your floor. Next time will probably stay more centrally strip located. Although may have same elevator issue location will be more to our needs.
10,I left my room at 9am. I did not put my valuables in the safe. The room was cleaned after I left and all my valuables were stolen. The hotel sent a security guard who offered me a coupon for two free drinks. I tried to follow up with the front desk security guards and subsequent calls to the main line and there has been no response from the Luxor.
50,We had a good time we really enjoyed staying there I really recommend For anyone to stay there. We're hoping to come back sometime this year. The food was great And all the employees were very nice thank you
50,I just got home from a three night stay at Luxor. Very clean rooms and some of the most friendly and caring staff. Good selection of slot machines and loved the check-in process via the app on my cellphone. Will definitely be back here.
30,The AC in the room did not work. When I played around with the settings the dial actually went past the indicated setting for Hot/Cold. When I checked the grill/venting with my phone to see if air was coming out I saw what looked like metal shavings/rust inside. It grossed me out.
10,I purchased a corner queen suite. It was run down no additional amenities... no coffee maker. Has a weird second room that literally has 2 arm chairs and a TV... no where anyone would sit work or relax. When chicken strips are $20 and a mixed drink is $22... it is not anywhere I would ever stay again. The poor was nice and the spa was nice. Rest of stay would find another location in Las Vegas. People in elevators saying same thing. Needs renovation to make it worth the inflated prices
30,I kind of wish that I would've read the reviews first. It was okay and the pool was really nice. Breakfast buffet was amazing but the room was not as nice as I'd expect especially for the price. Also not sure if it was just the cleanliness of the air but for some reason the floor of the casino messed with my allergies and asthma bad. Did not have the same issue at any other casinos we went to.
20,We had two adjoining rooms and there must have been a party therre the night before so they left glitter penises all over the floors and we found trash behind the windors the desks were full of water underneath the glass - the room we were in was right next to the room they used to store and wash towels so it was noisy and the front desk people were very rude.
20,If you like to have bad service then there are a few hotels on the strip you could choose but the Luxor is definitely one of them. All the bartenders have no social skills. And they actually charge you almost 5 dollars a refill on drinks at the food court.
20,Digital key access to elevator and room was a joke. Customer service failed at timeliness and assistance. Housekeeping gave grief when asking for towels to accommodate 4 people. Pillows were a squishy mess and provided no support. But the shower head was great. Awesome pressure.
50,Great place ti stay fairly clean. Just this hotels needs to clean there shower heads. I had to clean it my dam self. Other than that fun place ti gamble. Really good restaurants. The staff is friendly.
10,Unsanitary room and dangerous bathroom was put in a room with safety issues with no reguards to the Healh of me or my children management had no care that my son was hurt in there shower don’t recommend at all
20,priced correctly for the state of the property. I'm not complaining about the obvious problems with the hotel given the room is about $20 per night. Resort fee should be reduced. Not clear there is a pool. Smells a little smokey
30,Just wasn't impressed as a whole. Elevators were nasty and made a ton of noise. The room was just outdated and overall underwhelming. Casino was ok. The restaurants were ok but nothing to write home about. HoweverTender steak and seafood was outstanding.
40,Overall. My girlfriend and I were very satisfied with our stay at the Luxor during our time in Vegas. The staff was friendly and acommadating. The room was clean but relatively basic which was okay we were there not there for some top tier tier suite experience granted what we paid but instead to enjoy what yhe strip had to offer. The only issue I had was with the wait times in line for check in but that could have been offset by mobile check which we didn't do so we left very satisfied with our overall experience at the Luxor.
20,Room was nice but not nearly as nice as what I’m used to at the park MGM.  The customer service was poor. Spa amenities we’re out of service.  My gold status was revoked after I worked very hard for a long time to build up to it. At least one member of staff was actually rude to me. I was woken up and my kids were broken up when I went to sleep in.
40,Decent hotel good location. Busy place very poor tv quality and check in was hectic even when done through the app. Had to wait in line for keys due to digital key wouldn’t work. The tv was fuzzy on all channels. There is a long walk to some rooms from the elevator.
10,The place is a mess. More than half the time I couldn't even get the elevator to stop on my floor. And the stairwells are downright scary.    Even the Vending machine on my floor was broken.    Also this place is nowhere near ADA compliant so far as I could see
30,I liked the staff and it hypothetically could have been a good hotel but it’s very tired and the shower was clogged. I ate at Diablos which was good. The room randomly did not have a refrigerator. Popcorn ceilings and the elevator at an angle is super strange! It’s connected to Mandalay Bay and Excelsiur
40,All was great until I found a used bar of soap and used shampoo bottle in the shower after I received my room from check in. Kinda gross!! Other than that room was comfortable air conditioning worked and the bed was comfortable. I would recommend the tower rooms over the pyramid rooms. There are 8 elevators to each tower rather than 4 with the pyramid which helps with not having to wait to go up or down.
30,I choosed the Luxor hotel for a business/pleasure trip. The waiting time in the lobby was annoying the staff had been nice or rude depending on who you land on. Smoking inside is allowed in the Casino so be aware.
20,On arrival long wait at check-in only to be assigned a room that had not yet been cleaned by housekeeping. It was also not the room type I reserved in advance. I was given a new room however the new room was covered in crumbs and hair from the previous occupant. Very poor overall cleanliness.
50,Stayed here and the room was super clean and we'll kept and modern staff where nice there is alot Todo at the Luxor shows or gamble and alot of places to get a bite to eat. Also the pool is a nice area to relax
50,Keico the front desk agent was extremely helpful kind with great old fashion customer service. The rooms were very nice clean and fresh smelling. But no coffee makers microwave or refrigerators in room. Hotel was always clean and fresh smelling throughout building even in the casino. No heavy smoke smell. Property had 4 Pool area’s which was very nice clean and wait staff throughout to take food and drink orders. Must reserved cabanas ahead of time so you will be prepared to pay the rental cost $$$. Will most definitely stay here again.
50,Older place but kept nice great staff clean remodeled rooms. The pyramid is fantastic. They have an excellent gaming floor. The food court and pyramid buffet and restaurant were very nice also. Will stay again!
40,Leaving the same for a review as I left for their customer service form. Value for the dollar seems to be fair.    The Great: Quieter end of the strip. Quick access to two other hotels (Mandalay and Excalibur) NY NY is also really close. Casino not nearly as crowded nor as rowdy as some of the others. The cleaning staff was awesome. Unexpectedly good was the Pyramid Cafe.    The Good: The pool was good. Mandalay was better. Refurbished rooms were very nice. Wish I had sprung for the suite. Got to see one it was excellent. Overall value for what you get seemed right.    The not so good: The décor is underwhelming by comparison. (I don't know how you fix it. What you see when up on the room hallways does not show when you are on the floor.) The check-in line was painfully understaffed but I guess that's everybody right now. The elevators...the effin elevators. First off if you are (as I was) perfectly situated between the two it is a haul to get to them. I can't imagine that walk on the lower floors. The lower floor elevators in the Pyramid are in rough shape. The wall panels by the doors are not even secured to the frame properly on all 8. It's a bad look. The elevators for the tower however are very nice so we know you can do it.    The Bad: The table games were not staffed most of the time. It was brutal TBH. Also the lack of cheap tables as a result was notable. It almost seems as if you were creating false demand to get the bet limits up. I hope that's not the case. There is just too much to do and see in Vegas I don't need to spend my time playing craps and blackjack at what used to be high roller minimums. Also no poker room?    MGM as a whole needs to work on it's table game portfolio as well as return to single or double zero roulette and go back to the old Let It Ride Tables. At least they still had some reasonable number 3/2 blackjack tables left even if the limits were egregious.    Vegas as a whole needs to work on its smoking policy. This would be a good Casino to start a no smoking experiment in. My entire bag of luggage came back smelling like an ashtray something the Casinos in my area don't contend with. Give it a shot Luxor it's a gamble that might pay big!!!    As far as over all it was a solid value for the money. This trip had shows planned every night so I really just wanted a nice bed which is what I got. My experience was overall positive. I would consider staying here again for a non gambling focused trip.
50,Great location and great hotel. Indeed.  The only downside was that there isn’t a fridge in the room and the parking lot is paid.  The piramid is phenomenal and the casino is huge.  Definitely I will stay there again.
30,Pyramid King Suiteneed updating. Not coffee pots or bathrobes in Suites. Hotel & Casino was heavy odor and smoke. Check-out staff did not give me and itemized bill. Housekeeping was effective and responsive.
30,Wanted so badly to love this resort as its an icon on the Las Vegas strip but sadly I did not. The basic tower rooms are actually much nicer than the MGM Ida at the buffet was WONDERFUL and the bartenders are nice but it stops there. I feel like the value for your money is not there and MGM as a company doesn’t care. You are just a number on a players card to them now.
10,My stay at the Luxor has been the worst Vegas experience I have ever had. Dirty rooms! I had to be swapped to 3 different rooms and none of them were clean. The housekeeping manager was rude when she came up personally and I pointed out everything she missed after claiming to had pre-inspected the room herself. Crusty substances on the furniture hair in and around the shower bathtub and in the alleged “clean” towels and bed sheets.  Staff was rude dealers were rude and the crowd wasn’t the best. It was the worst experience ever. Pool was freezing hot tub was cold and broken.  Also didn’t like that my card kept being charged for every single purchase rather than just pre-authorizing for a larger amount and just charging the correct amount at checkout like any other place I’ve stayed at.    Everything about this stay was unpleasant and annoying. Never returning here!
10,We used to like to stay here but not anymore. Bad guest services you don’t get the room that you booked or reserved and they say they comp you hotel credit but they still charge your credit card. I do not recommend staying here. So bad.
20,The Luxor is showing its age hallways and casino floor need updating. Food ($31 hamburger) and drinks are very expensive and not high quality at the casino restaurants. The updated rooms are fine but nothing great. The drinks at the pool are ridiculously overpriced and not good. Avoid the $28 margarita (horrible) and $80 for a bucket of 5 beers is a stupid price.
50,The room was clean and really comfortable the staff was friendly as well we had a very nice trip here. The shops are fairly priced and not overpriced. I wish we could have stayed a few more days here.
30,Decent place to stay but older. Could use some updating the air conditioner was really noisy. The casino was nice and the service was good. Many of the restaurants close early in the day which was a bit challenging if you wanted to have breakfast or lunch later in the day.
10,Every single employee I spoke to told me different information which ultimately ended with me paying more and getting my room 4.5 hours late. I only ended up getting a room at all because I had to find a random employee standing on the side and complained to them. The entire experience was exhausting and set up to make you spend more money.
30,When I made reservations I specifically asked if the pool is heated  she put me on hold came back and said YES! Arrived and pool was freezing and hot tub barely warm not comfortable to get in ….and btw hot tub is super small also …
30,The elevators are the slowest i’ve ever seen and once in it feels like they’re about to fall apart.  The card reader on it worked only half the time which led you to go for a joy ride up and down without stopping at your floor.  The amount of dust on the furniture in the room was ridiculous.
10,The fridge and coffee pot was taken out of the rooms which is very inconvenient because a bottle of water costs an arm and leg. The AC was making a very loud rattling sound and didn't cool at all which of course is never a good thing in Vegas. Slots are terrible!
50,The Luxor is reasonably priced. The rooms are great and so is the staff. They make every attempt to expedite the check in process. I have stayed here countless times. As always I am leaving with intentions to return to this hotel.
50,I’ve been coming to this property for over 20 years. I’ve stayed at all the five star hotels on the strip but the staff at Luxor truly treats me like a king. I may be a king on a budget but regardless they make me smile and feel important. Those fancy five star hotels are usually catering to a much bigger spender than I ever was. It shows in their staffing where someone with a high tier player card is king. While us normal folk who can’t throw C notes around like nickels are penalized by ambivalence and just plain rudeness.
40,Overall quite nice would have appreciated a better result when we asked specifically for two adjoining rooms. Shower gets water over over the floor it really looks like its missing a door. Alarm went off and woke everybody up. This is a very unique property to the strip and I enjoyed it despite the problems.
30,My stay started off rough but it smoothed out when I was put into better situation. I feel as though the room I was put in initially was one of the worse rooms in the Hotel that was facing a wall and because I am a military member I think could have been upgraded.
10,Room was extremely dirty. Food crumbs on carpet and bathroom floor was extremely sticky. Didn't look like it was cleaned in months. Sheets were dirty with hair and stains. The room looked and smelled like we were sleeping in a vegas alley.
20,"Check in was pretty good. I have heard people have had difficulties with the phone check in and being locked out of the elevator getting to their rooms. Someone said you must have the App on in the elevator in order for it to work. I would suggest checking in at the desk. You will be asked if you would like to be "" Upgraded "" for a fee to the towers or as our friends were automatically "" upgraded "" without a charge. I don't know about the rooms there but our friends told us it was quite the walk to get to and from their room in the tower. We stayed in the pyramid. I would suggest a higher room if possible. Looks as though the lower rooms look out to another building and roof. There is absolutely no information in the room about services offers etc. and nothing offered at check in other than a map of the facility. The room well No Coffee No refrigerator No microwave! And no room service after a certain hour if it was even available as we always were wanting later in the day. I think it closed in the early afternoon. There is a Starbucks that opens in the morning if you don't mind paying $5 for your daily coffee and there is a store that offers $12 sandwiches and $12 6 inch already made Subway sandwiches as well as chips etc. again expensive. After hour food next to nothing. We actually had to order Door Dash to eat. Imagine Door Dash to eat on vacation! Even motels offer a coffee pot and free Continental breakfasts. The room itself was good. We did not watch any T.V. so cannot comment on that. We heard talk that the Luxor is going to be taken down so perhaps this is why there is no investment in this Hotel. You pay a daily amenities fee not sure what for maybe for the pool. You will pay a daily parking fee if you have rented a car and the parking lot is a walk you can use the Valet but again another fee for this. If you have any problems the front desk does not answer calls. The hotel is not close to the strip but they do have a great cab service just go to the front and then line up for a cab. We did enjoy the Casino however it did not seem as though the servers were very happy and we tipped very well every time. We saw others did not tip at all which I thought was not good. The servers do work very hard. I suggest if you want regular drinks tip your servers! We stayed a total of 5 nights. Had the room been unacceptable and we had not liked the Casino this trip would have been a bust! So disappointing especially as we have not been away in over 4 years and had so been looking forward to this trip. Do your research and read the reviews. We only chose this Hotel as our friends from the U.K. had booked it and we wanted to be close to them. Never again! Just pick another Hotel I wish we had."
50,"The Luxor Hotel & Casino was a true ""Vegas"" experience. We had never been to Vegas and could not have asked for a better place to stay. The room was great with one of the most comfortable beds that I've ever slept on."
40,Did not have the room I booked upon check in the problem was resolved the next day. Staff wasn’t very helpful until the next day I had to go back to front desk so I could be put in the room I paid for. Overall it’s a nice place to stay in Vegas and not too expensive.
10,There were so many problems that I can't list all of them!!! The room was dirty and had many issues. Wasn't moved that night either after many calls to the front desk. The bathtub was dirty and carpets dirty. Damages and rust on shower as well!
50,Everything was great after the first 15 after the first 15 min of our stay was excellent our first room was still dirty but the front desk happily upgraded us to better room and after that everything was excellent
50,We just stayed here for 5 days and had a great experience. Check in/out was easy with doing everything mobile. The room was clean and the staff were friendly. The only draw back was how far the hotel is from everything that we wanted to do but easily solved with getting a bus pass.
30,I do not feel as though the rooms should be as expensive as they are. The hotel is not a terrible choice but there’s better hotels along the way. I had things I like and also disliked about my stay. Would book again just not my first or second choice.
20,It is poorly maintained it has poor customer service. They charge you for everything! If you want a fridge for the room you will have to pay. You will have to pay for parking. A beer costs 16 dollars!! There is no option of a coffee machine in the room. The queues for check in or check out are huge and you have to wait a lot.
20,I came into the room and it was not cleaned. I found a half eaten chicken leg with mold growing on it. I wanted to puke. I also found a ball of hair collecting near the smoking tub. It was gross. The staff apologized but I had already gagged in my mouth.
10,Paid for a king show up get put in a Queen room that being 6”2 sucked but being told we would be switched out the next day I was ok with it. Never got switched but got put in a nasty disgusting room that we tried to stay out of.. no response from them either.
10,Checking in and finding our room was a nightmare. We walked the whole place searching only to find out that the desk clerk wrote down the wrong room number. The door to our room didn't close right and left a considerable gap between the door and the door frame.
20,One star for friendly & helpful staff. One star for comfortable bed. Honorable mention is that they are very dog friendly. Everything else was awful. The casino smelled like sewer. The card reader in the elevators did not work reliably which meant that once the door closed you were stuck until someone else opened them or you called for help. Which I guess is why every elevator also had a broken open phone case. Shower has no closing door just a pane of glass in front of the faucet so you have to stand in the shower to turn the water on which results in you getting doused with freezing water. Also because there is no door to close the bathroom gets absolutely soaked so the bathroom door has water damage. One morning we never had hot water at all! Restaurants close early. There is one diner that stays open late but it’s so crowded it’s not worth trying to eat there. We tried and it took 45 minutes to get a sandwich. With so many choices in LV there is no reason to spend money here.
10,We had a horrible stay at the luxor we will never stay there again. We will tell everyone we know and talk to not to stay there room was total crap from the old furniture popcorn ceiling broken toilet broken tub 6 trips up and down to front desk for a working key staff was unhelpful passed us off to V.I.P desk who's suggested we move to another hotel
50,Great Room. Great Atmosphere! People were dancing all around the casino having fun! Very good table hosts. Friendly service. One of the best casinos in Las Vegas. Great affordable shows. I give this rating a 5.
40,I was hesitant based on a number of negative reviews and knowing the property had some age on it. But we had good stay. Rooms were clean not spotless but acceptable. Yes the elevators are rocky - but they are also not going straight up / down. You have to make sure your room card gets a green light before picking a floor. Wish room had a fridge - a shortcoming for sure. Overall we had a good stay no issues to speak of staff was helpful. Check in was not the nightmare I feared however Sunday morning there was quite a line - guess it depends on timing. Our teenage sons thought the Egyptian theme was cool. Pool area was nice spent one afternoon just relaxing.
10,the check in was very long. I stayed at another property on the strip and check in was very quick during this same stay. The Luxor was 45 minutes to check in if not longer. My room got burglarized and nothing was really done or done to help me. Pretty disappointing stay
50,My recent stay at the Luxor in Las Vegas was FANTASTIC!! Great rooms and Casino with friendly staff members all around. Rooms are super clean and it's exciting to actually stay in a Pyramid. I highly recommend the Luxor for your Las Vegas experience...
50,Always prefer m life properties . I tell my friends that they definitely should come and visit the Luxor in particular and they will love the experience and the casinos. I love the beautiful Egyptian artifacts and how clean the resort is and I will visit as much as possible.
50,Love the shows casino restaurants and bar lounge. Great hotel to stay for a weekend or a week. The Fantasy show is a must see. Diablo is a good Mexican restaurant. Back stage Deli has great food and service
50,It was a wonderful experience for us as this is our first time back after over two decades of absence and we enjoyed every minute of it God willing we’ll be back in the near future for another incredible experience!
40,Thanks Luxor for the comp room very comfy beds and first floor access made things simple. I’ll be back soon with my family and most likely stay here because of the huge pool and comfy beds. I need to gamble too.
20,I had an industry conference at the Mandalay Bay so stayed at the Luxor because it was cheaper…MAJOR mistake. A colleague’s room was robbed another colleague’s bathroom ceiling was leaking from the shower of the room above and I was accosted by a prostitute. When I declined her services I was then approached by her merry band of thieves asking if I thought if I was too good for her. I politely explained that I was not interested in her services and went on my way. Bad Vegas experience.
40,It was an amazing time in Vegas was my first time there and enjoyed a lot. Luxor has many benefits if you go to Vegas as a first time because it is in Boulevard Avenue and you can go walking to any place. The only thing is that it doesn’t have any restaurant 24 hours.
40,The draw will never fade...still love the feel and style of ancient Egyptian hotel. Even with the age I still feel like it pulls me back after spending time visiting rest of strip I still gravitate back to luxor.
50,Beautiful hotel highly recommended just the only thing I wish was in the room was a fridge this way you can have drinks in the room such as water or at least have a mini bar in the room would be a good way to make some money all in all was a great stay can’t wait to return
50,Reasonable price (for Las Vegas) dining options (pyramid cafe deli). Very comfortable beds. Excellent price booking bundled w airline. Easy walk to Mandalay Bay for additional shops and restaurants. Rooms clean.
20,Elevators don't work properly! Spent Extreme amounts of time waiting for elevators and in line for players clubs and box offices! Paid extra for early check-in and room was not ready. More impressed with their sister resorts!
40,Our work trailer blew 2 tires outside of Vegas so we had to stay so we made it fun with our kids. This hotel was super fun for them. Staff was helpful and check out is so much better than other hotels in Vegas. They had plenty of people helping the long line to get us through quick. I'm only issue was I got a stay well room to help my disabled son and keep other kids calm but the aromatherapy wasn't working and the air purifier filters were dirty. And for the price I can't believe there was so mini fridge for my baby's milk
10,False advertising on the website. Pool is not heated. Traveled to Vegas so my nine year old daughter could enjoy the pool. It was 80 degrees outside but the pool couldn’t have been more than 60 degrees. No one could swim. When I complained the staff said “we like to believe the pool is heated by the sun”. This is unacceptable and false advertising. I checked out after one night but the staff was em unable to shift me to another Mgm grand hotel. I was on my own to figure out. Will never step foot in Luxor again.
40,We visit the Las Vegas Strip 3 or more times each year. This was our first stay at the Luxor one bedroom suite. The room was nice but could use some updating. The beds and pillows were very comfortable. We stayed there due to the great price we got. The housekeepers were very friendly and efficient. One biggie is I wish the toilet had a privacy door. Overall we were happy with our stay there and will be staying there again in June/July.
10,The Luxor has run its course and it’s time the building to be put to rest. What a terrible place it’s become. The staff was rude. The place and rooms smell awful! The carpets are matted and dirty dirty - about 30yrs past prime. The worst though is the bathroom design. Only half the shower has glass. This might look cute but since it’s so small it floods the bathroom floor EVERYTIME the shower is turned on making things very dangerous! There’s a card in bathroom saying how they care about water. We had a good laugh about that.
30,Long lines everywhere: check in elevators coffee pool towels. Accosted by the sales person pitching the time share sale before I could even get checked in. Also the smoke in the casino is disgusting. I can’t believe this is still a thing. It’s 2022. Room was nice clean & quiet but mattress was tired.
50,The Luxor was a wonderful place to stay. The staff was very friendly and knowledgeable! The room was very clean and well kept by the housekeeping staff. Had a problem with door lock. The front desk notified maintenance right away and sent a key up to a new roomand moved us into a new room. Keeping our vacation going well! I recommend staying here!
50,The days of long lines and delays upon arrival are gone forever. I actually checked in to my room before even leaving for Las Vegas. Upon arrival my room was waiting for me and was opened with a digital key from my phone. Wow! It just doesn’t get any better than that!
40,I came to the Luxor for my solo birthday trip. its a in close proximity to the dolby live where i saw silk sonic. all of the staff were super helpful and curteous. Recommend the valet if your driving. will definitely be bak in june to go see the jonas brothers concert.
20,First time staycation at the Luxor and not wowed at all rather disappointed!  I had a room (3214) with a really bad view on valet parking super dark and depressing (even during the daytime) and that’s what I get even after requesting higher floor and nicer view to celebrate my birthday ☹️  Your online check-in process needs fixing!!! I checked-in online and was waiting for room to be assigned and to get digital key and it never happened until I called FD and they told me that I need to go into the line for check in than I told her that I already checked in online and just waiting for room to be assigned and if she could give me an estimate time for room to be ready? She told me rooms are ready SOMETIMES after 3pm and after briefly putting me on hold she told me “you are right you are checked-in and I just assigned you a room!”  I wanted to go to spa earlier before checking in and to put it as a room charge but didn’t have room number so they wanted to change me extra because I was “not a hotel guest” and couldn’t even go to the pool because I didn’t have a room key!  So I would recommend when someone books a room and arrive early (before room is ready) at least pre-assign room number and don’t issue a digital key or actual key until room is actually ready but let your guests relax at the pool or spa or be able to go to eat and place room charges and save cash for gambling.  I had LATE checkout and DND on the door and GRA still knocked on the door and tried to open the door and asked me when I will be leaving?!?! I PAID EXTRA in advance for late checkout and it was on my reservation until 3pm so hotel staff should respect privacy (DND) and they should be aware of late checkout times!!!  Room next door to us was “connected room” (door in between rooms) and we could hear them even when they were normally talking with my tv on and especially at 4am when they came back to their room loud and rowdy and woke me up! Marijuana smoke and stench was seeping underneath the door to my room - it was awful.  On the day of checkout I started getting emails with “reminder” that is “Departure day” and “do you want to checkout?” “Just click here for easy checkout” 3 emails (probably automated but nevertheless it felt like you could not wait to get rid of the guest.) Maybe in ONE (1) email you could put “just reminder it’s your departure day but if you would like to EXTEND your stay we have “special” discount rate for you just click on the link below or if you still planning to leave there is a link for easy checkout!” - this message would feel more welcome and hospitable than CHECKOUT! CHECKOUT! CHECKOUT!!! - even with LATE checkout in reservation.  There is no ROOM SERVICE?!? for hotel that size and on the Strip that’s very disappointing!!! Few of my friends called to try to send amenities to my room for my birthday and they were told that it is not available and no way to send: champagne chocolate covered strawberries desserts flowers or actually anything besides “We can put “Happy Birthday” message on tv screen in the room.” Really?!? That’s a lot of lost revenue for your property- just saying!  Spa and pool are closing at 5pm while sun is up till 7 (and soon even after 8pm) - unacceptable!  Overall very disappointed and not expected any of this from Luxor- maybe from Circus-Circus or Motel 6 but not from the Strip property.    Hopefully someone will actually read this and try to improve guest’s experience on this constructive evaluation of experience from guest’s point of view. Fell free to contact me if you need any clarifications.  Thank you
30,Website photos were very misleading. Rooms are very outdated. Several outlets in the room didn’t work. Outside windows were filthy. Check in was easy due to the app and hotel staff was friendly. The location is not great but You are connected to the mandalay which is nice.
50,This hotel was beautiful the staff treated me and friend very nice this was our first time staying here they answered all our questions gave us some tips directions just everything about Luxor was nice
40,The rooms in the west tower were updated and comfortable. The casino is on a lower level than the food and it’s nice to get a break from the smoke. The pool was ice cold and unusable. Overall we enjoyed our stay and it was a comfortable. Staff was friendly at check in and bell service but our server in the casino restaurant was cold and unhelpful. Easy to get to other hotels with the tram and connecting walkways.
50,The hotel was a great design with everything a person could want under on roof!! Kimberly at the 24 hour store by the the front entrance was amazing!! She made our whole trip!! All the staff was friendly and very friendly.
20,"We checked in very late at night and found that the toilet was running continuously AND the fan on the A/C was running continuously unable to be turned off. Maintenance came the next morning to fix the toilet while we were out and when we returned they had fixed it but for some reason had used all of the clean towels and then LEFT THEM soaking wet on the shower floor.    Our return to the room also is when we realized how hot it was in there and that's when I realized the fan was blowing hot air. We could not turn it off. Maintenance came quickly and fixed it so we were able to turn it off AND now it was blowing cold air when turned on.    This room was NOT ready to be given to guests. There was also no refrigerator which I thought was weird. They'd just removed it from the cabinet entirely. Because of Covid somehow? No idea but it was a run-down room and we were disappointed.    I picked this hotel b/c I was bringing my teenage son to Vegas for the first time and thought he would find staying in a pyramid fun. Instead he had a terrible first impression of Vegas. ""The hotel look cool from the outside but they're disappointing when you go inside"" is what he said the first night we arrived. I will not stay here again. I should have stuck with the Cosmopolitan where I usually stay when I come with my husband.    There's no door on the shower so the floor gets pretty wet when you shower.    Also the casino was VERY smoky. Air quality was way worse than the nicer casinos. Will not be staying here again."
40,We were attending a convention that was being held in the Mandalay Bay Convention Center. The Luxor offered a better price with very similar amenities. Check in and check out was very easy and the staff was very friendly. We stayed in the East Towers on the 19th floor and I was really impressed with how quickly the elevators got you to where ever you needed to go. Beds were comfortable. Ultimately is was an awesome value for the perfect location!!
10,Refrigerator is broken staff was rude barged into my room at 3 a.m. even though they were told to wait jacuzzi in suite was broken management did nothing to compensate the inconvenience when I brought it to the tension so many things were wrong with the room. They didn't even offer to give me a different room with amenities that did work since I did pay so much for a suite to have a jacuzzi in it and it didn't even work. Not to mention the broken refrigerator didn't work had somebody else's food in it from a previous day that they made never cleaned out of it and there was trash that we found underneath things in the room that signified the room had it been cleaned properly either management did not seem concerned about the issues seems like they knew about the issues and just didn't care to fix them
40,Overall this was a great experience. Unfortunately the tram wasn’t working so we had to do some extra walking. But that didn’t stop us from having a great visit. I wish they had in room coffee. Not a fan of Starbucks.
10,Treasure island took way better care of us knowing it was our first time there . This place gave us a crappy view room with an A/C unit that had no idea how to keep cold. No coffee makers. (I get it but..) Exactly the culture that is killing Vegas. I won’t be back- Luxor killed vegas for us.
40,Had a great experience there. They have a great staff. Everyone was super nice and helpful.    My rating is a 4 because I got lost a few times going to the West Tower. Lol There's two different ways to get to the elevators so it was a confusing at first.
20,Title says it all. the rooms just look and feel too dated. Needs major upgrade. Bathroom drain so slow. Only has handheld shower and won't stay on one place. No coffee maker no fridge. Toilet has visible wear. The room just looks dirty even when it's serviced by housekeeping.
20,Rooms looking really run down shower water gets everywhere trash in the lobby very gross will not stay there again the casino floor is nice but very sad because it use to be one of my top picks location is good if you like to walk
30,The hotel was well kept. Food from the johnny rockets and Nathan’s seemed old. The elevator system sucks! Sometimes the card wouldn’t register so we would miss our floor and had to go back to the first floor to register the floor again. And what we hated the most was that we tried to sign up for late checkout from our suite through the app we were having trouble so we went to the desk to inquire. We were told that late check out was no longer available for us because they needed the room. We planned out whole day based on having to leave at 11(very annoyed because we were hoping to check out late from the start) on the check out day we go to the desk hungover at 11am to discover that we did in fact have late checkout at 3pm as originally planned although the front desk person told us otherwise the previous day.    We had a suite because we wanted something nicer for our wedding day but the room did not have a full length mirror or closet.
10,Worst stay that I’ve had. Extra costs even to the food. Not worth it. They fast talk and swindle. They even make swimming a charge. Takes the fun out of the trip. I have money but also know my worth. A waste.
10,This place sucks ass I want my refund it was way to much for what’s it worth I’m sorry I will never come back to this weed smelling place  ………………………….. and the costumer service sucked it tools 3 calls to get towels……………………….:::::……..
10,The service wasn’t the greatest and I’m on a business trip. The first day check in went smoothly  but when I tried the book an extra stay they were giving me a hard time. Plus my Girlfriend had a huge cut on her foot and we asked for aid. Told us to try a store next to the front desk but we asked another employee and they brought one out for us no issue. So there are ppl there that are super lazy
50,My husband and I always book Luxor hotel. The price is right and the hotel is clean! You won't regret staying there! Highly recommend! The only negative thing I have to say about the hotel is the location. It's one of the last hotels on the strip so you'll need to take taxi to see the other hotels or to the shopping center.
50,Nice pool great gambling slots comfortable rooms and beds. loved the buffet. The staff both in the hotel and on the gaming floor were great. really like that some of the places to eat stayed open until eleven at night.
20,Charged extra for “upgraded” room. Smelled like cat pee and the AC didn’t work. No mini fridge microwave or coffee maker in the room.  Check in was crazy! Expect to wait in line for at least 30 minutes.  Housekeeping did a great job though
50,This was an amazing trip and everyone at the Luxor was friendly and professional! Excellent Service and very clean. I will most definitely be coming back. I would like to come back again and stay more than 2 days.
30,"Originally booked 1 room for business travel for me and my Mister decided to get married while there so booked 2nd room. That was ""Stay Well"" room. Price for that one was double and NOT worth it. Over all average room. Staff is extremely helpful and friendly."
50,What a great trip. Staff was awesome rooms were clean. Repeat customers from now on and we come out every year for March Madness. The service from check in to the staff and maid services were all on point!
10,The room smelled musty. The shower was not good. After you got done taking a shower there was a puddle on the floor. Half of the pool was closed and the hot tub didn't work either. The good part was the bar by the pool.
40,Good hotel glad we didn’t have the angled elevators as they were pretty rocky. Had issues with check in but once they were resolved we were happy. You do have to pay extra to have a fridge in your room which we thought was silly.
20,Poor amenities but a good price for the Strip. No coffee maker fridge or microwave. The rooms were very nice and comfortable. The restaurants and casino were nice. Lots to see and lots of shows. Overall not too bad but I wish there was more transparency about the amenities.
30,Make sure you get rooms that are upgraded. The old construction have no shower doors. Had water spraying everywhere. Was informed that they will provide extra towels to clean up the water. I never got ethe towels during my 4 night stay.
20,"Check-in and Check-out at the LUXOR are a problem if you need to speak to someone. It's probably better if you take the option of doing their job for them and check-in and check-out yourself. Paying extra for early check in and late check out does absolutely nothing for you they will fight this all the way and tell you ""its not guaranteed"" Good luck finding a Concierge! Nobody in the hotel can tell you how to speak with the Concierge or where they are! Bring your own soap and shampoo once you use what is in your room they refuse to give you more. If things in your room are broken or not operating correctly they will not move you to a different room or fix them they tell you to call a number and ""submit a ticket"" they tell you this as if you work for them. Nothing between the Luxor and Excalibur is working (walk ways escalators etc) I suggest spending a few more dollars and staying somewhere else this hotel is not cared for and other than 1 bartender ZERO employees care about you or your needs. There are too many other options don't put yourself through this!"
40,For this being my first visit to Vegas I was surprised on how much there was to do without ha ing to go outside. I was there for three days and had to find a reason to go outside. Loved the Friendly staff and the atmosphere. The o ly thing I did not like was the cell service and Wi-Fi service because you need that for your electronic keys.
30,I was not impressed on how you find the lobby in regards to arriving. It’s not setup like other hotels that have a grand lobby area.    Elevators were located in The middle of the casino. My toilet leaked water around the base.    No big blanket and the bed only had 3 pillows. The shower sprayed water on the floor causing me to use extra towels to dry the floor.    No smart TVs and horrible cable package.  No good restaurants that I found in this place. If so they were hidden.    Lack of communication with staff on how to work the elevators. USE YOUR ROOM KEY TO SELECT YOUR FLOOR.
50,The stay was great overall. Staff was very friendly and helpful.  Very comfortable room good size and clean. Floor was quiet.  Luxor has a big Casino and many amenities.  Excellent location and reasonably priced. I had a great time
30,Upon my arrival was very stressful and frustrating but the customer service made up for it I really feel like the rooms could have been better service and maintenance. What I recommend this hotel to a younger crowd yes
40,For the cost I feel it is the best on the strip. Location great cool vibe and bars to play machines. Better drink service then other casino's for sure. A little sewage smell from I think the coin fountain the whole trip was the only downside.
40,The staff at the Luxor was knowledgeable and helpful. The rooms could use a remodel. Good value for the room. Dining was a bit expensive but that's to be expected at a casino resort. I will be back and stay here again.
30,The rooms are old and outdated. The rooms do not have a refrigerator. Th beds are comfortable. Casino area and food court are clean and modern looking. Very long walk to parking garage. Good choice of shows.
10,Bathroom was disgusting and smelled. Keycard on phone wouldn’t work. The elevators are filthy. Called and waited for over 30 minutes and then waited over half hour again when waiting for the manager that never came and they sent a housekeeper.
40,I would stay here again it was very nice big a lot of things to do check in was pretty fast but i think it depends on the day and everyone was really nice and willing to help out loved the ride share area really convenient
30,My room was atrocious there had been a layer of sticky film on my table tops. The shower did not drain well so I had to take the fastest shower of my life in the middle of the desert. I would not recommend this hotel.
10,Room Rate + $35 resort fee + $15 parking = overpriced resort  No safe in the room shower sprays all over the bathroom no coffee pot no refrigerator (but there is a spot for one) bathroom sink is missing the stopper nice view of the interstate 1:45 minute check in time one date they didn't fix the room (we were told short staff at 9:30 p.m. the did the room up). Diablos was a mess tables on both sides of us complaining about their food $96 for an appetizer one entrée of street tacos and two drinks. The show Fantasy was very good.
40,The stay was nice. They checked us in early and the customer service was great! My daughter and I had spa pedicures and the ladies really took care of us. We were offered champagne with the experience.
50,So this was my first time in Vegas. Everything was wonderful. Room was clean. Staffs was friendly. Everything came out perfect. I would go back and to the same hotel. I had a great time. Thank you Luxor and see you next time.
20,"Checking in was rushed and they want you to check-in using mobile app. They rush you! Checkout was even worse. They also want you to do express checkout so that you can't actu6see your charges until after the fact. After my checkout I noticed charges that were not mine. I was double charged for overnight parking and valet services which were not used. I asked for it to be corrected and they said it couldn't be settled right away. They did take off the valet charges but still charged 2x for overnight parking at check out and when I left self parking. It has not been corrected. The staff didn't seem to care that their system was ""acting up"". Highly recommend you keep an eye on your charges while you are there and expect to waste an hour in line trying to get it corrected and then still. Have no resolution. Also went to the pool and with in 5 min I see a man bleeding from his ankle and he just gets in the pool to rinse off the blood. I brought to the staffs attention who said the pool filters itself out. I decided to leave the pool at this point and was told pool would be open until 7 on. I went back at 6 and they told me the pool closed at 6 not 7 and that I could always come back the next day. But the next morning was my checkout. Very frustrated with my stay!"
30,We had fun but the staff was rude and the check in and out process was a disaster. The systems were down so we couldn't check out now we are being billed more for something that wasn't our fault and staff didn't seem to care.
30,Room was not updated. Lack of place to plug in phone. Overall clean - nice bed. Was surprised by the charge for parking as I thought this would be covered in the resort fee. The pool area was very nice but the water was very cold.
40,Great hotel  reasonably priced . Have stayed every year since 2018. On this trip I actually booked two nights at Mandalay Bay and two nights at MGM. Long story short by the time I got to the hotel I waited in line for four hours to check in and there was an issue with the waterlines and electricity on some other floors at Mandalay Bay so they sent me to the Luxor for the night. I stayed in a different suite back in 2019  this one was on a different floor. They also gave my $50 for comped food .
10,I visited Las Vegas from the 11-18 March staying at the Luxor. I booked my stay through South West for the Luxor hotel. The resort fee was charged on site. In addition they charged a deposit in case the room is trashed. The day I left the line for check out was long and the check out machines were not working. The representative at the line said no worries just leave the key in the box and everything will be dealt with. I noticed I had a $300 bill instead of my $200 deposit. The bill stated its a bill for smoking penalty. I am a non smoker and the whole place is filled with smoke cause they don't have a non smoking law in the establishment. I don't smoke and how in the world will I be charged for smoking. I am disputing my charge. Anyone who does go there make sure you get all your ducks in a row They are doing the run around with me now.
50,It was nice because it’s more unique experience than other hotel rooms. We got a slanted room with a hot tub bathtub it was very nice and cool experience. We we’re both happy with it and would definitely book this room again.
30,Woke. Nightly by a screeching alarm for 20 minutes at a time. Woke us from a solid sleep to near heart attack. Result of alarm was a minor situation that was under control. Secondly the timeshare staff that cut you off your route to check in. Follow you l stop you and hold you up without regard for your schedule or travel. They don’t take no for an answer unless you start to express irritation. This was not a one time thing during check in. This occurred every time you enter the lobby from an entrance your room or even just trying to access the casino approaches. Big turn off.
50,The stay was great the only thing that I would say went bad was the elevators on the pyramid side I believe some didn’t work so it would take like 15 min to get downstairs or upstairs  Overall everything g else was good
30,Need more workers. All the guys in the suits were standing around while the line was out the door. 3 workers and all those work stations doesn't make sense for the amount of people checking in at all hours of the day. The elevators need major upgrades. They all were shaking and the room keys worked sometimes and at other times it didn't leaving people to ride it up and down until it finally worked and you were able to press your floor.
40,This is my 3rd time staying at the Luxor. I love the location the amenities offered the large rooms with comfy beds. The casino is great and the shows available both there and close by are super. Would recommend to those looking for good value!
10,We checked in with our phone for the ease of access because we have a 5 month old baby that i wanted to expose to vegas the least amount possible (we were in town for muscle cars at the strip and regrettably the Luxor was one of the only hotels with a bathtub). When we finally got into our original room there was no fridge so we had to upgrade the room so I could keep my baby’s milk fresh. We called and were able to upgrade the room for a little over $50. We then tried to go to our next room and the phone would not allow us to get to our floor. We eventually had to give up and walk to the opposite side of the hotel through the Smokey casino with our 5 month old to get a physical room key. The woman that helped us seemed to hate her job even though we tried to be friendly with her. When we finally were able to get to our room there was a disturbing amount of body hair and glitter in the bathtub and poop all over the toilet seat (I have pictures of the toilet seat). Not only is this disgusting in itself but with Covid protocols I can’t even believe this happened. To top it off someone with a shared wall decided to have a party in their room so we got to try to put our daughter down with music blasting into our room. I will never recommend a family member or friend stay here. When my husband called to let the staff know what happened the woman he spoke with told him she’s not sure what he wants because we’re no longer staying there. Definitely not how you treat someone you would want to come back and stay with you again. The housekeeping manager was much friendlier. Overall we felt like we couldn’t sleep couldn’t bathe and should stay as far away from the bathroom as possible.
40,Luxor always is a good value if you want to stay on the strip. Location is a little removed if you want to go anywhere else besides the Mandalay or Excalibur. If you want a quiet room stay in the towers but be prepared to walk. If you don't want to walk stay in the pyramid
20,Check in was crazy and the shower was clogged. We reported it twice and nothing was done during our stay. So when taking a shower you had to be quick or water would be all over the floor. Then the people in the next room played with the adjacent door every day and that was reported too. To top that off housekeeping never came to clean the room. I called and they said the do not disturb sign was on the door and I told them I didn’t have one for our room. Then we paid the resort fee in cash and the they stated that they couldn’t find it because they added to another account. I wish we stayed at another hotel!
50,Very clean and stylish hotel. Stayed in the East Tower. Rooms are clean and comfortable staff is friendly. Floor was very quiet sleep well heard no noise. Definitely will come back and stay again. In a good location.
10,The hotel misplaced serval of my packages. When I tried to inform management of the issues I was having I was met with an attitude from the night manager Logan and was aggressively talked down to. I had to ask him multiple time to stop speaking me to rudely when I was treating him with respect. I won’t be returning to this property if this is the type of management they keep.
30,My husband and I stayed at the Luxor. I would recommend another MGM hotel. Check-in was a nightmare. The line was out the door and two attendants helping guests. While many staff stood around. The cleanliness was poor. Our room was poorly lit needed to be deep cleaned things were broken you could hear the adjacent rooms conversation like they were sitting right next to you. I would invest a little extra and stay at another resort on the strip.
50,I always stay at Luxor but this time I went back I was disabled. I called ahead of time and Perla made sure I had a room closest to the entrance that there was available at the time I got there. She assigned the room and I was able to do my mobile check in! Thank you Perla!
20,We stayed at the Luxor Hotel and Casino because they had a special offer. You get what you pay for. The room was drab and sparsely equipped. The tv didn't work well and the bathroom floor was soaked by the shower.
50,Clean room and friendly staff. The food was delicious. The gaming was good. It was my son and his fiancé's first time in Las Vegas and they said it was an absolute dream to stay here. We are all hoping to come back soon. Thank you all.
10,Stayed at a comped suite. It was ok. Dated. Overall just sort of gross. Long check in lines. Casino smelled/reeked of smoke. Elevators were often not working. We were overcharged. I would avoid it. It’s further down the strip so takes Awhile to get to better places. Next time I’ll pass up the suite for a regular room at Bellagio.  The food at Diablos was decent.
30,Arrived for the ISRI show early to enjoy Vegas and was disappointed from the moment we arrived. 3 hour check in process - room didn’t match what I reserved - terrible service in the casino - loud obnoxious behavior in the hallways until early morning.
40,The hotel needs to be updated and the elevators are super slow and took a long time. Check in mobile was not working at the time so we had to stand in a long line to check in. Amenities were limited not refrig no microwave or coffee pot.
10,Incompetence all around from start to finish. I have never seen so many employees with so little regard for someone else’s time or experience. If I were this bad at doing something I would do something else.
40,My room looked really nice and was very clean. The only problem with this hotel was the elevators. Most of the room key readers were not working properly. I had to swipe multiple times for the elevator to function compared to other MGM hotels I've stayed in.
10,Beds were extremely uncomfortable awful pillows. Long check in lines. Food places not open as posted hours. Was rudely yelled at by a bellhop about bringing my own water. Something always out of service
20,It was sad to see how run down dirty and unkept was this hotel in the inside. Every time you turned around something was broken. Elevators Hot tub in pool walkways. You walk the hallways and you can see the years of bust built up on the ceilings. The trash piled up in elevator trash cans. The trash on roof tops of food court. Hand me down furniture in rooms from Bellagio. I didn't dare eat at any of the restaurants. I would hate to see what the conditions in the kitchen look like.
40,Great room just missing coffee maker and mini fridge. Only downfall is it that it is far down the strip making for a long walk down the strip Anywhere we had to go. But the rooms were very quiet inside.
20,From issues with paid early check in. To the view of the inside of the casino from our room the experiance was not one I would recommend. To friends and family. No to mention an welcome packet was was hoaxes as welcoming and was actually just a ruse for a time share seminar.
50,Very clean and spacious rooms. Easy to navigate after my first day. Clean and huge bathrooms. Loved the location of the rooms. Quiet and not a lot of foot traffic. The only thing I would like to have was a coffee pot in the room to start my day. However the ice machine was close to my room.
10,Our stay at the Luxor was quite disappointing. The room didn't have a fridge the shower flooded you couldn't case to the TV. Breakfast options were few and often out of items. Our room card deactivated twice during our stay. I would stay somewhere closer to the mid-strip in a more modern smoke-free hotel.
20,Stayed in lots of hotels on the strip over the years but this hotel doesn't seem to have been as well maintained as the others. The beds are super uncomfortable the rooms are ok at best and the casino smells so heavily of smoke it was almost unbearable. I don't normally care about smoking but this was really bad. Don't know if their a/c is dated like the rest of the hotel or what but they need to figure it out. Service was sub-par at best too.
30,The Luxor really gives you a lot for your money. The suites are top of the line but the lower tiers of rooms are just average. I do think they have the best staff on the strip. They treat me well each and every time and I keep coming back. You can easily get to any place on the strip with this as a starting point but can also maximize fun by just staying within the connected hotels. You can go between the Luxor Excalibur and Mandalay Bay without stepping foot outside. This has been my go to spot for at least 8 years!
50,We showed up a day early and were able to get a room and an upgrade! Excellent service from the front desk as well as the pool staff. We chose to rent a space at the pool. 100% worth it. Water/Ice refilled in a timely manner all day.
10,Not a happy customer at all most of my expensive things where stolen from the room and management did not seem to care or help me out. They also have no cameras in the hallway which i find weird. Would not recommend staying here unless you dont mind your things getting stolen.
20,I have stayed at Luxor many times over the years but after a 2 year absence due to covid the deterioration is very obvious it's tired and in disrepair. It's understaffed and service is suffering.  On the positive side the spa is still a lovely experience and the staff professional and very welcoming.  The rooms are lacking any character or amenities but the beds are good and even right by the elevator it was very quiet.
30,Elevators were watching broken wish we had a fridge and microwave. Homeless people were also sleeping outside of hotel doors. Other than that customer service was great And friendly and always guided us in the right direction.
30,Old hotel in need of an update but consistently reliable. Great price for the location and decent facilities (indoor and outdoor). Staff is friendly and reliable rooms are well lived in but for the price; don't complain.
50,Hotel room was clean super friendly staff lots of dining options and you don’t even have to leave the hotel. My only complaint was we checked in early on Sunday and we never seen a housekeeper the whole time we were there and we checked out Thursday morning
50,Thank you to Luxor and MGM properties for a great weekend with family and friends. Rooms were great food was great. Staff was friendly and rooms were very clean. Elevator could use some improvement otherwise it was a great trip.
20,Service at front desk slow with extremely long lineups. Trying to get through on phone always more than 20 minutes. Status taken away from us to lowest level. Very inconsiderate after being a member for over 10 years. Than add the price increases without getting anything better for your $$. Lost respect and desire to return
10,Dated and overpriced. The staff is great but the amenities and facilities are old and rough. Restaurants are good but a bit pricy. Bartenders charged us for beverages even though we were actively gambling. If you’re at the point you need to charge active gamblers for alcohol you’re not doing well.
50,We booked a premium king suite for one night on our honeymoon and it exceeded expectations. The staff was super helpful and even knew how to give us directions to places in the connecting hotels. Plus the whole layout and vibe are awesome!
10,ZERO STARS IF POSSIBLE. Hotel Staff sucked booty were rude and condescending except the luggage assistant and taxi assistant who both deserve everyone else’s raises and a bonus for excellent customer service
20,There isn’t much use for the room aside from sleep and showers. There’s no microwave or coffee or fridge in the rooms the shower fixtures are starting to pull from the walls. There are whole sections of wallpaper peeling from the walls it’s just getting very rundown.
30,I've stayed at the Luxor for the past 20 years or more. This was the first time back in 3 years due to Covid and you could tell it had been a rough 3 years. Gambling options were limited high minimums on table games and poor odds on video poker if you can find a machine. No poker even at Excaliber and only limited hours at Mandalay Bay. On the plus side rooms are quiet beds are comfy and showers are great.
30,Don't expect coffee maker or a fridge to keep your expensive leftovers cold. Get in and get out unless your 25 and dont use the room ~ I probably wont stay there again. The Tender Steak House was amazing. Great food wonderful staff and beautiful ambiance.
30,We were woken up multiple times in the night because of the faulty alarm system. Also no fridge or coffee maker in the room. No cell service (Verizon) in the rooms. I can't say much about the staff we used the app to check in and out so we didn't interact much.
10,We tried to check in early with the app so we could get in free early check in. However the app wasn’t working and wouldn’t check us in. I then learned why-they didn’t even have our room. We checked in at the counter and they didn’t have the room we booked in the Pyramid. We booked that room for the experience. They “upgraded” is to basically same room in different tower. Then we were woken up by group of maids at 8AM yelling/talking RIGHT by our room. I assumed it was guests but I was wrong. I told them to quiet down since it’s still quiet hours. They continued to be extremely loud. I tried to call the front desk but they wouldn’t pick up and after 30 minutes of waiting I gave up. I would absolutely not stay here again.
50,I love staying at the Luxor. The rooms are nice and clean. There are plenty of food options and the food tastes great. Plenty of slots and game table although I didn’t hit any jackpots this trip. Overall a very nice hotel.
20,All in the title. Where was build up on shower door broken tiles in the bathroom and some………suspicious WHITE stains on the floor between the bed and side table. When our mobile key didn’t work we couldn’t get ahold of anyone to help. If it wasn’t dirty cheap I would have thrown a fit lol
10,We had 2 nights stay due our daughter soccer tournament. Friday the alarm went off for 30 minutes after 11pm and we could not sleep well. Saturday/Monday morning Justin the maintenance person was using the snake to clean the zinc pipes outside our room from 3:40 am - 4:10 am causing terrible noises in our room. Not able to sleep again. When we woke up our zinc was completed plugged so we have to go downstairs to even brush our tooh to attend our 8am game. Worst experience level. I know they gave me 50% credit but we still ended up paying over 300 and not able to sleep or use the bathroom.  Terrible
30,Went to Vegas during march madness 2022. Luxor shows its age compared to the number of newer casinos on the strip. As someone who wanted to gamble more and pay less for a place to sleep Luxor was perfectly adequate in that regard. However so much of vegas is going above and beyond of which Luxor does not do. If I were coming for a friends trip or bachelor party type vacation I would absolutely be willing to stay here again. If I were bringing my family or here for business I would not.
50,Came to hotel for a concert. The rooms were amazing as well as the service. The buffet was closed by the time I checked in at 3 that was disappointing. I spent the nite there at the hotel. The room was awesome but it did not have a fridge. I had a King suite. That was surprising. Everything was so clean and fresh.Overall I love this hotel. Right on the strip great games to play. I would go back in the future. I really want to try the buffet.
20,The air inside is very bad!  The room is OK - OLD! Heater clicks loudly all night!  Restaurants are very limited - buffet closes at 3PM!?  Not very good entertainment.  No game room for kids to play in.  No clear instructions about parking and hotel usage available!
40,"We arrived here just before 11 pm. At check-in we were told we would need to pay a resort fee and security deposit. We were told the resort fee was for the use of pool spa and the wifi. Although you could connect to the wifi before even checking it and the spa/pool were both shut so not sure why we had to pay the resort fee. At nearly $400 dollars already down we headed to the lifts to get to the floor. We were staying on the 15th Floor.    We had read a lot of reviews about the lifts and how they were not the best got stuck or just did not work. We were a bit sceptical about getting the lift but we got the lift as we didn't feel like doing the stairs for 15 floors. We had absolutely no issues with the lifts. They never got stuck they never broke down they were working completely fine. A lot of people didn't know how to use them and expected to just press the number for the floor it would go up. You had to use the key and then press the floor. It's even written on a little sign in the lift.    We got to the room and was pleasantly surprised at how nice the room was. We expected the room to smell like smoke as the casino you are allowed to smoke but it didn't. It was clean the bed was comfy the shower/bathroom was lovely and it had great pressure. The AC/heater in our room didnt really work it would only blow out cold air.    Housekeeping was great they would leave bags of clean towels toiletries and water.    The casino was great except for the tables. There was one rude man working one of the tables. We had never played at the tables before and wanted only one go so we put the minimum down as we had no intention of sitting there for a long time and the man at the table said ""there are cheaper tables over there that you should go to"" he was very condescending and patronising. For this reason we wouldn't play at the tables again.    There are little food shops in the Luxor only downside to them is that they have no prices on the items or written down underneath them when we asked the staff how much something was she gave us a range of $4 - $10 not so helpful when you want to know how much one bottle of beer is.    We would definitely stay here again."
40,This room was nice for the price. The location was great close to other Casinos. Hotel was well kept. I do wish they gave you a fridge microwave & coffee maker but that's standard for Vegas. Beautiful hotel clean room nice staff.
40,Besides the bathroom having random hair in it. Everything else from the room to the rest of the hotel was fine. No main issues besides the cleaning issue. Pretty decent location on the strip and not to bad of a walk to other places
40,I had a grand time. I’m not a gambler but it was still fun and there’s something for everyone. Spa was a good experience and pool area is nice. I went to Tinder their steak house. Service was absolutely amazing! Sports bar had a really good rib eye as well. Overall it was a good trip. Rooms need serious upgrades abs better Wi-Fi/service connection for phones.
40,Better than several others right around them on the strip. A little farther down from the main action on the strip but not to far. Easy access to an AM-PM gas station right across the street. Quick and easy access from the freeway.
30,We paid a pretty price to stay in a one room suite at the Luxor. We were a little disappointed as the room had no drawers for our clothes the mattress was very uncomfortable and you can never get through to a live person on the phone in less than a 10 minute wait. We probably won’t return.
50,West tower a little too far wish they had more clerks at the front counter for check ins. Good comfortable and clean rooms Great service by housekeeping.. overall great stay would highly recommend Luxor!!
10,This property shows its age. We booked a corner suite hoping for a high-end experience. Luxor failed to deliver on all counts. The elevators didn't work as they should. The front desk gave us the wrong room number. The whole place smells of cigarette smoke and the dining options are decidedly low-end. (Breakfast at the pyramid cafe was solid but overpriced.). I recommend staying at a different property.
30,Maybe great if gambling/drinking/smoking is your thing. Not a place for a family or for anyone with class. Went because of soccer tournament not sure why a healthy positive event would contract with a casino?
50,100% recommended 👌. Very nice staff nice shows beatiful hotel. Good breakfast at the Cafe. The pool is beatiful. Nathan's place socks very rude my cashier. The parking and is a plus I took my car everywhere!
10,When I checked in - the line was over an hour long. There were probably 75 people in line and only 2 people working the desk. Fire alarm went off in the middle of the night - 2 nights in a row. Shower was missing a door. Very poor property.
50,Always my pick to stay never really give any other hotel a chance. Been about seven times and never had any problem with getting a room or a bad stay. Taxi and valet is always on point and rooms are always fixed and toweled when i get back from a night on the strip
40,This hotel was a trip but totally cool architecture and atrium. Elevators are actually inclinators. Good eats and nice clean rooms. Casino not as good as other MGM properties. I would recommend this hotel.
30,Experience was nice - long distance to walk to the self parking - room was very dusty and had other issues also the tv didn’t work. Check in lines were long but that is to be expected. Over all it was nice - I had better experience in other hotels in the area.
20,Poor customer service through out the entire property. Booked tru spring break and half the pools where closed. then closed the only pool at 6pm.hot tub was maybe 70 degrees. You would purchase a $30 Drink inside then couldn’t take it to the pool area. Pool area drinks water over priced. $49 for a six pack of beer. Price gouging on basic essentials. $10 for two waters. The room walls where dirty. Elevators where out of service non stop creating long lines. Ac ran non stop for 5 days and never got the room cold.
50,Luxor older hotel in the city of light but still an amazing stay great room rates and amazing tables to play at and all the shows to see …definitely consider the luxor for your next stay this was my first time here and it was great
30,The AC wasn’t working in our room and it took forever to get an actual person on the phone. When I talked to someone  he said it would be taken care of that night but no one showed up. There was no coffee maker in the room which forced you to go to the Starbucks and wait at least 30 min to get coffee. Can’t even make French press coffee since there wasn’t even a microwave in the room.
40,It was a long walk to the room and the bed needed a comforter or something. Great price but the resort fee for services I wasn’t able to use this trip was a bummer. I wish all Vegas hotels would consider finding a way to just charge those who want it but I’m sure it’s just all about the extra $$$$$. Luxor is still probably my favorite overall despite any issues.
50,The hotel was clean. The room was a good size. Lots to do and see in the hotel and was conveniently located to other hotels and attractions as well. We loved the Titanic exhibit and the 24hour store was nice to have right there!
30,We were very unhappy with the long long check in lines at 1am...not enough workers...the beds need to be replaced. I've never slept on such a terrible bed. :( the room was clean otherwise the resort is good
30,My pyramid room wasn’t particularly modern but plenty of space. My friend’s room in the tower was smaller but had obviously been renovated more recently. The Egyptian theme was fun. Staff in general were friendly and helpful. Restaurants fair to middlin’. One bar added $10 to the tip on a bill signed to the room for two drinks that I’d already tipped for. Pools weren’t open for the season yet so can’t comment on those. And no no big wins. There are worse places to stay on the strip.
40,This was our second time at the Luxor. The casino is small enough to not be exhausting yet large enough to have variety. One thing I wish was different is if you could use comp money or resort credits at the Food Court.
20,We requested an upper floor room and was given a fourth floor room with NO view. There were also areas of the floor that were dirty with trash for all four days we were there. I had looked forward to staying at the Luxor for years and I was sadly disappointed.
50,Check in took a while but when we was greeted they were friendly and helpful. We stayed in the east tower which was quiet clean and comfortable. The room was cleaned daily and the cleaners done a great job. The bed was extremely comfortable. There’s a safe in the room. There’s also a hair dryer and shampoo/condition/shower gel in the bath room. The only thing I’d have liked that wasn’t in the room was a fridge to keep drinks cold and a kettle so I could have the option to make coffee but otherwise no complaints. Throughout our stay the staff we encountered were great with a good option of restaurants and bars within the hotel lots of shows/exhibitions and the casino was great. Highly recommend and would definitely stay here again.
10,Old out dated place dingy and needs a major make over. Had no running water our last night for a few hr unexpectedly. Room furniture stained and chiped and are bed was hard. Worse casino of all the MGM resorts (old) dirty.
10,Agent at check in was rude. Not producing what I requested. Would I send my client here. Not a chance.I seen many other rooms while I was there. Newer and updated. Clean provided phone books paper and pens. Lotion for guests too. No water pressure.
40,Just stayed one night-was in line to check in and lady came up asking if she could help get us checked in faster. Yes thankyou! She was very helpful with mobil check in and actually upgraded our room for free. Everything in lobby/casino and our room was very clean. Casino was pumpin with TV music/videos and also has dueling pianos going on. Everywhere we went there was entertainment. Ordered drinks and server was friendly and drinks came fast. I would stay here again and I would recommend to others :)
40,This was a very easy place to find on the strip. The room was clean and easy to get to. I liked how it connected to other hotels and was easy to go walk on the strip. The Vallet parking was very good and easy to use.
30,Bathroom had no towels or toilet paper other room was not clean they left mens under garment I called that same and nobody ever called back or came up so when I checked out I told the lady at the check out she said I was going to get my resort fee reversed and nothing has showed up on my cards
30,While the rooms are good in the East and West Towers the casino area smells of smoke and has a unpleasant odor. The food was very good and decent value. Overall service was good. However as I mentioned the entire casino level as a very distinct smoke and odor that is unpleasant to say the least. For me I will not stay at the property again. Overall rating of the property of the average is probably being kind.
10,This hotel has been a major disappointment. I have stayed at several other locations in Vegas and Luxor is by far the worst. I would even go so far as to say it is one of the top 3 worst hotels I have ever stayed at in my life. Here are a list of issues: Overall very aged and unclean with uncomfortable smells found everywhere including the room. The television in the room is the lowest definition possible giving me flashbacks to 1999 cable tv. It also only has one kids channel Nickelodeon. This is only an issue for people with kids who need to give them a break sometimes. The TV also automatically starts with a volume of 30 which on a scale of 1-10 would be a 8. That is VERY irritating whenever you want to watch something while your two small children are sleeping. Speaking of sleeping ours was interrupted twice by some sort of emergency alarm. This was also VERY irritating when your 5yr old is TERRIFIED of fire alarms. He was anxious all day constantly asking why the alarm went off only to be awakened AGAIN during the next evening by the same alarm. I don't know what is different about this hotel but I have never been awakened by any sort of emergency alarm either inside or outside Las Vegas. Additionally there were no toiletry items in the bathroom. The beds in 4138 we're very uncomfortable and sank towards the middle. Not enough power outlets with the ones available poorly placed or not working at all.
20,app for using phone for key didn't work had to wait in line for registration again for another 30mins to get physical key. Once in room the AC does not work. Room temp 78degrees. 1st day called and waiting on hold for 90 mins over the course of multiple calls to try to get the operator or anyone really for help. Never answered. Went back to wait in line again for another 30 mins to have them say they will send someone up. We again had to leave for a show came back and guess what was not working? AC not working. now last day- left early- tried to check out online- doesn't work. tried calling- no answer. surprise surprise.. hey the new tower has no AC but if you stay in the older actual pyramid part the room was great according to my kids.
30,Jacuzzi was broken and the pool the water was so cold was like one person in there and was spring break week better go to the Mandalay Bay paid extra 50 bucks but was worth it… and past 2 nights the alarm was going on at midnight was terrible.. last for a least 30 to 40 min
30,I had trouble Checking in. Digital key would not work. Had to stand in line again. Not enough people checking people in! Over 100 people in the line at 1 A.m. finally got in my room at 1:30 AM. My $350 free play that was promised I never got. Breakfast at the pyramid was overpriced for what they serve but the Buffet at breakfast was great. The casino definitely needs more signage. Couldn't find anything without asking. They need more information in their rooms. No pen or notepad in the room. The room was fairly clean but still had debris on the ground.
10,This hotel needs serious help. The room smelled like water damage and sewage. There were sections of the hotel curtained off and behind the curtains you could see rooms that were tented off going through some sort of chemical treatments. CLOSE THIS PLACE AND REFUND YOUR GUESTS FROM 2022
30,A unique place to stay with average rooms that need to be cleaned and maintained better. We enjoyed our stay but feel they can do better maintaining rooms and elevators. The value was good but you can find the same value in better locations.
10,Customer service for questions was lacking and our room for the week was the worst I've seen! Sticky stuff left on tables toilet was dirty no fridge bed had HUGE dips in it all the way across shower leaked all over the floor elevator was a nightmare all around not a place I'd ever recommend!!!!!!
50,This was a family trip with kids everything was great no problems at all. Totally recommend. No noise complaints restaurants close by a little far from the main parts of the strip but still enjoyed it. The price was great as well.
10,The property itself is very dated. The mold living on my shower door was enough for me. Checked into a room that I didn’t reserve. It was gross moved to what I reserved it was gross too.  Immediately checked out to the bellagio. Way better experience all around.
10,Room was hot Ac blew hot air. Took 8 hours before someone finally came to fix it. Staff had horrible attitudes. Rooms are out of date. Only 2 elevators were working in the entire casino and no stairs to go up to your room!
50,Had to stay another night and couldn't get a comp room and it was there fault I had to stay another night. Other than that I had a good time. They made me pay for the comp night you would think they would be more understanding!
30,Luxor Hotel & Casino    Las Vegas    Not satisfied    The elevator shakes the bed was so uncomfortable there was no mini refrigerator and the walls all scratched up n dirty. I guess cause of spring break week the line was long to check in so download the app and check in that way. Which was very helpful.
30,Hotel was average and dated. Stayed in the East Tower seems housekeeping in common area is lacking these days with overall cleanliness. Staff was friendly and online check in was easy and convenient.
50,I haven't left a trip advisor review in years but this is worth the time. On the first night of our stay we encountered a bit of a snafu. Being more of a budget strip hotel I just didn't expect any resolution. But when I went to the desk and chatted with the staff they were SO NICE compassionate and understanding. They more than resolved the problem for us. That type of service is what makes you want to stay at a place again. This is of course a more budget place so the rooms are nothing too fancy but the beds were really comfy and I really loved that the water in the bathrooms got hot instantly! Plenty of things to do in the hotel and the tram to the hotels next door was nice. I really liked that for the daily parking price you have access to all the MGM hotel lots. It made getting around to shows and such really convenient.
50,Nice modernized accommodations & friendly staff that help thru all inquiries/Security is very sound & available when needed…2nd floor attractions are very nice with no smoke in the air-refreshing for the LV Strip!!!
50,Luxor has a cool theme that the whole family enjoyed. It is an older hotel but it is clean and not run down. We enjoyed eating at the restaurants swimming gambling and shopping. Staff is amazing from front desk to the maids.
30,Celebrating my birthday with family for a memorable day we like the friendly host on the front desk they were very helpful and polite the security is the once’s who don’t have any manners and are very rude
50,Don’t spend more somewhere else. This one is good don’t get me wrong  has everything you need! You will spend little time in the room believe me. The casino and shows are the best. Food amazing. Try Diablos cantina you won’t regret it!
20,First the wait to check in was incredibly long with only 3 staff members working slowly to help people check in. Once we arrived at the room it showed clear signs of the last occupant — pretzels and other debris on the floor water stains on the bathroom counter and floor and stains on the duvet. The Location was decent but that’s about the only positive at this property.
40,Room was nice and clean. Didn't feel outdated like I've seen in past. Basic but good enough. Very happy with HyperX Arena for my teenagers who love playing video games. Food court good was really good don't ever remember saying that about any food court (Have military discount which was great). Close proximity to other family attractions like Excalibur and New York New York was great for my younger kids.
50,My first time staying here and it was a great experience. Access to taxi and Uber stations were convenient I liked having to use room key to use elevators. Looking forward to the Asian restaurant opening maybe next time.
10,"I would say that ""it smelled"" but the word ""stank"" better encompasses the level of fun involved. Smoke weed mold and bad cologne mingle in varying amounts to assault your nose. It's dated. The rooms look decent but compromise in quality where it counts with the linens towels and bed. Food and drink are decent but prices are premium."
20,Booked a tower premium suite and was given a casino floor room next to the elevators. There was no sound proofing we could hear entire full conversations from down the hall as if they were happening within our room. If they try to give you a first floor room do your best to get off that floor! Overall the room was kind of gross. The shower drain was clogged and we called the front desk and they just sent maintenance to unclog it. To which the guy that unclogged it said there was a bunch of hair in it and then insinuated that it was us who had done it. Also the shower curtain was old and stained yellow. Just makes you question the cleanliness of the entire room if they couldn't change out an old stained shower curtain.
40,My only complaint was the design of the shower stall. That is the only reason I’m not giving a 5 rating. Shower has a half door stall with no way to close it off. Water splashes out and gets the floor slippery. Beds were very comfortable and clean. I would definitely stay again.
50,Loved the look of the hotel.  Awesome Titanic exhibit. Very easy mobile check in.  Even got us in our suite 2 hours earlier than expected.  Great service When we had a problem with the door to our room and were unable to close it we simply grabbed our luggage and move to a different suite.  Be prepared to stand in line for god only knows how long to sign up for MGM rewards… just couldn’t wait .  Would have loved to have been able to do it online and simply have the card waiting when you get there.  I know we lost out on a ton of points. But other than that we would definitely return.
50,Are stay from check-in (which was great) to our departure was fantastic. The room was very spacious comfortable and quite we couldn’t of asked for any better we recommend this to anybody that comes to Vegas.
50,Pleasant first experience. Fun big casino. Love the all you can eat buffet downstairs. Unlimited drinks for an hour and a half for 11.99 was amazing! The only minus was only 1 pool was open and the hot tub wasn't hot and the pool was way too cold. Also my shower flooded the bathroom as the partition is inadequate to cover the high pressure shower. Elevator rides were cool as you travel at a 39° angle not straight up and down. Very nice staff. Exceptional room service. I just wish my do not disturb sign didn’t get stolen. Overall. Cool feel here and good energy. I Will Come back maybe all pools including interior pool/spa will be open.
30,We love the design of the Luxor it has an exceptional Las Vegas appeal! We traveled there for pleasure and we were not disappointed. Even our kids had a great time at HyperXArena. A great addition to the Luxor. One issue we had was with their app. The idea is wonderful no keys needed for your room or elevator and prepaid self parking. But the idea was not executed flawlessly. We had to try and try and try to get the elevator to work but to no avail. Our app would t bring up the key! So we were stuck and luckily someone came aboard the elevator that was on our same floor. Then we get to our room and our key didn’t work! I had to travel all the way down to the lobby to get help then I was told to print my room keys! What was the point of the app? Then the elector key reader would only work on one side. I know we were in Vegas but I shouldn’t have to bet which side of the elevator key reader worked! All in all this was a minor inconvenience. We still had a great stay and enjoyed ourselves greatly.
50,Excellent customer service. Just wish we had a fridge in the room. Everywhere we went the staff were amazing. Buffet guy at the drink counter was super nice. The guy that cleaned our table gave us lots of ideas for things to do. Check in was smooth. Just overall great experience just really wish we had a fridge to save money and our leftovers and bring food in for snacks and drinks. Would definitely go back!
50,Luxor definitely rocks. For the 2 nights and 3 days I stayed. It was very satisfying. Thank you for the experience. I would definitely come back on my next trip. Family friendly. Friendly staff. Very attentive.
50,I saw all the negative remarks about cigarette burns in the carpet the smell of marijuana everywhere and the lack of a refrigerator. I arrived to my room and found it to be in great shape. There were vacuum marks the bathroom was shining the bed was very comfortable and no smell at all. The lack of a refrigerator meant nothing to me as there was no need to keep anything cool. The lamps beside the bed have plug ins for your phone to charge. The check in process on the app was very smooth and easy to use. Staff were friendly and helpful when I had questions. I would absolutely return for another stay to the Luxor!
50,Everything was great we had an amazing stay staff was very helpful the bath tub was huge !!!!!!! The room was really nice and had lots of space and storage including a safe kid friendly just an overall great place
50,It's not the fanciest place on the strip but the rooms have been updated I always get lucy in their casino plenty of entertainment - really best palce for the money the MGM rewards program is great pool is nice (you gotta go early - it gets crowded)
30,Overall the Luxor was in decent condition. Unfortunately multiple of the moving walkways were not functioning and members of our group have mobility/ health restrictions that made this incredibly inconvenient. The elevators in the east towers were also malfunctioning and became a headache to use. Only one pool was open and the hot tub was overrun with children doing cannonballs and splashing with no parents in sight. We will more than likely be staying at one of the more premium resorts in the future if we are going to be paying premium prices.
50,This place is unreal the atmosphere is surreal best please in Las Vegas!! I will keep on coming here whenever I’m in Las Vegas also the vibes are amazing just being in Luxor makes me happy!! This is the best hotel in the world!!!
30,Elevators & escalators were all broken. Your physical key card would not work the elevator so don’t even bother trying to use the app. Everything was great but these two things. The elevators were so busted wires were sticking out of the button panel. Come on now
40,No shuttle service too airport and beds are stiff flat kinda hard. Slots are tight.  Food options were hard to get into. The buffet was decent for price. Mandala bay is next door with great food options.
10,My family and I were headed up to our room with another couple. The doors to the elevator would not open more than a Crack. We were stuck in the elevator going to different floors without letting us out. It was terrifying!!! The staff never fixed it or closed the elevator. We went down for dinner and there were other people stuck in it!!! The rooms are out dated and dirty. Furniture in rooms are broken and missing. None of the plugs in the room are secure so your chargers and other plugs just hang out of them. It's not worth the money.
40,I have stayed in Pyramid Rooms before and they are pretty average however the tower rooms are quite a bit nicer and do not have the overwhelming smoke scent. I would highly recommend spending the few extra bucks for the upgraded room.
10,We had booked 2 rooms well in advance. But eventually only 1 room was available as originally booked. As a result we could express checkin only 1 out of 2 rooms via app. The manual checkin process at frontdesk was super slow. Staff wss taking a long time per guest. They gave us a different category room and our group was separated as the rooms were in different buildings. Not impressed.
20,Good news: I will say that the pyramid room and bathroom were clean and large and well furnished.  Bad news: Although I entered my wife's name on the on-line registration and she received a player’s card with her name on it when we arrived she was not listed as an occupant of our room and was told she was not able to enter our room. Fortunately I had shared my digital key with her and she was able to get into the room and spa. The digital key worked only intermittently and myself and other guests took multiple trips up to the top and then down again and then up again in the elevator. Some guest were cursing the elevator. Elevator movement starts immediately when the first guest is able to get their digital key to work while the other guest struggle to get their phone digital keys recognized. During this movement the elevator sometimes passes the floor that you are trying to get recognized and stop upon. As many as six people were rushing to the front of the elevator to enter their floors and waiting for the second and third person to get recognized. One women even complained that her paper key sometimes did not work properly. On one trip I passed my floor several times and because my phone would not work I called my wife who was in our room at the time so she would stop the elevator from the outside hallway button on our floor. I have a brand new S22 Samsung phone and the app was so slow to load that I passed my floor another person also complained of this problem. It was a struggle to get into the room also having to put down all of your bags because it takes two hands to hold the phone in position against the door pad and while turning the door handle and having to turn the door handle five or six times until it caught and unlocked the door then gather up your bags and drag then into the room. Another total pain in the ars. Paying resort fees but no frig in the rooms!!! What kind of a resort is this? Hardly! While I attended business for the day my wife was alone playing in the casino but was unable to charge anything to her player’s card and had to pay cash for all items she purchased and also did not accumulate any point for her spending on the rewards account. Prices for food at all Luxor venues were at least double the typical cost outside of the hotel. E.g. Subway BMT foot long sandwich $14.95. Entryway from the self-parking lot was filthy dirty. Parking lot ground level paving under cover looked like it hadn't been hosed off in years looking
10,Poor service terrible self park location in relation to the check in desk and no baggage carts if you have luggage. Lousy choices for food with limited or no weekday hours. Old and dated casio slots with very limited selections
10,If you like Smokey casinos with overpriced food the Luxor is for you! Try $45 for a pizza at the food court $10 beers $20+ person for breakfast. Our room was ok could not keep the temperature reasonable…it would revert to 69 degrees regardless of what we set it too and the shower drain backed up after 1 shower.
40,Luxor's location on the strip was not ideal for our recent trip (very far from the concert venue we attended) but we appreciated that it was less crowded and generally more calm than other nearby hotels.  We were a little disappointed there were minimal nightlife options but understand that is what made the Luxor a more calm location.  It was evident the Luxor is an older hotel with cracks in tile peeling paint holes in the carpet work being done in halls etc.  The room was spacious and had a neat view of the strip. Bed was comfortable and it was also nice having a bathroom with a shower and a tub.  Staff were friendly and hospitable and casino had some good slot selections.  Titanic Exhibit was wonderful and Johnny Rockets was tasty (but extremely overpriced).  For the discounted price we paid we were pleased with our stay. Depending on the reason for our next trip we may plan to stay at the Luxor again.
40,I love the beds at the Luxor. The rooms have been remodeled and very comfortable. The casino is clean and a lot of options for gaming. The pool area is decent but the service was terrible. 3 hours to get a drink and we rented a cabana! You’d expect more. Also there’s no bathroom outside by the pool. Strange.
30,Everything was average nothing too extravagant. I would recommend staying if you want something just okay. There are no microwaves fridges forcing you to order more food. Everything was extremely expensive. The vending machines were turned off at night forcing you to buy a $8-10 soda/water instead of a $3 one in the vending machines. I probably will not pick this “resort” again.
10,Leisurely trip I went to destress myself but got more stressed out was never given a map when I checked in. I will not recommend this hotel to any of my friends. The rooms and elevators were very run down.
50,This trip was relaxing staff was friendly. We enjoyed our stay the room was clean and spacious I would recommend coming back . The break we needed definitely happened thanks to the staff of Luxor great service
30,Needs some work. Carpet stains wallpaper peeling in spots inclinaters not all working...and for the love of God check out early and look at your bill. We were charged for movies we didn't order and couldn't get it taken off because of the line we would have had to stand in was extremely long. Noone else could help with it.
10,The rooms were humid and smelled like cigarette smoke hair in between the sheets that were not ours. I would definitely not stay at this place again for the price they charges not worth it at all. Thumbs down
40,It was a good property to stay at. It was pretty clean but it did smell a bit weird. Not too much of a big deal but otherwise it was comfortable. I would stay again if the prices were the same as this time.
30,Poor sound insulation in the room you can hear people talking from the next door. Situation didnt change at all after the front desk send security. The cleanliness situation are not good floors are not clean you can tell the air is not well circled.
50,The keys to the elevators did not work and some elevators didn't work buttons was stuck and the elevator would let you off on other floors escalators weren't working either that alot of walking for older people would be nice to see security do rounds for people safety people who are staying with the Luxor should be able to feel safe the future in the rooms are very old and could use a upgrade the housekeeps left a dirty gloves on the table after cleaning just small reminder for the to make sure everything is clean bathtub was dirty and was able to smell the sewage smell in inside the shower other than that thanks for everything you guys do to keep Vegas fun
50,Awesome stay this makes second time I have stayed here but will come back again some day for a third time.. the pyramid is bigger than it looks and it is at the beginning of the strip so makes for a great entrance throughout the strip there and back to the hotel
50,Ernesto at the front desk made us feel very welcomed and because of him we decided to stay at that hotel an extra night. He was extremely helpful checking us in we will definitely be going back to get his professional customer service
50,Check in was easy I did everything online including adding my additional guest's. They were also able to check in with a digital key and online. Room was great too! I also did not have to pay for everything upfront.
30,The casino was very nice. The spa was lovely. We stayed in room 17-150 in the pyramid. It was a dream of mine to stay there since I was very young. I was very disappointed with the room. The bed sagged in the middle so badly that we had to hold onto the edges to keep from rolling to the center. For a king sized bed only 3 pillows were provided. The register for the thermostat was crusty/dirty. The drain in the shower did not keep up with the water output. There was no shower door or curtain so the water from the shower got all over the bathroom floor. There was not adequate lighting in the bathroom. The fan in the bathroom was very noisy but did little to remove the steam.
50,Totally enjoyed my stay at the Luxor. Great location and the remote check in saved so much time.  Had a little difficulty getting the gate to open in the car park though using the bar code sent to my phone.
10,Was not a pleasant stay at all scary hotel... too smoky for non smokers food too expensive and not worth the money...will never stay here again and would not reccomend... service was not up to part.. everywhere u walk out lined of the casino was you being harassed by the sales people trying to sell shows timeshare..not a good look.
20,do not check in on your app check in with person no matter how hard they push you just tell him now and ignore them so I think I know to do lady pushed and pushed and I had and the room that I needed with it’s not the room that I was supposed to have and they was trash and the trash cans the shower leaked into the floor and I had one set of towels for two people like I had a hand tow wash rag and a big doub that’s all we had for one person for two people in a room for a double bed do you think that they’ll be enough for four people
10,Poor experience. Did not get the room we paid for and received a general lack of caring. Services were not open and the virtual check in process was not intuitive or functioning. Overall this was a disappointment and we do not intend to stay again.
40,The customer service is wonderful room is better than average except that there is no fridge coffee maker and microwave. It would be nice to have the basic room accommodations in your rooms for your guests
30,Smelly room. No refrigerator no microwave limited toiletries make sure to pack your own. Slow elevator B1  The good is it’s location and connecting tram to the Mandalay Bay and Excalibur  Blue man show and bodies exhibit  Starbucks inside was nice for breakfast but like any other Starbucks be prepared to wait .
40,Good value no fridges in room though. Clean and friendly. Not the Westin but not the Excalibur either!! You’re going to get a good room though. USE THE MOBILE CHECK IN APP otherwise you will be in a line for a while
10,Self parking on the night of check was full because of some event. Had to wait an hour just to park the car. The mobile app check in didn't work so had to wait in line. The room was dirty with smudges on the wall. The water was shut off for 3 hours on one night. Also what kind of hotel on the strip doesn't have room service! Most of the restaurants were closed by the time of my late check. Couldn't even get door dash to deliver there. The food was way overpriced when the restaurants were open. The only real benefit was being able to go to the pool in the NEXT hotel because Luxor's pool was CLOSED. I will never ever stay there again!
10,The toilet was splashing water everywhere every time you flash so you would get dirty water all over you and battoom. Told maintenance man he said he will come and check and he never came back. And cut nails were by the bed.
50,Love the night life at rhythm and riffs at Mandalay my group comes every year right after the super bowl. Ri ra is our favorite late night hangout. We always enjoy the staff at pyramid Cafe as well...
10,"Our vacation to Las Vegas was for our wedding and we brought several people with us. We all had mixed reviews but mainly centered around the same issues.    While on the casino floor certain areas had a strong sewer smell which was a huge turn off so we ended up going to other casinos for gambling. In the areas that did not have that issue we did spend some time but we were more often than not ignored by the wait staff for drinks. This again pushed us to go elsewhere.    Alot of us were unhappy with the fact that the new ""European"" style showers would cause the bathroom floor to flood every time someone took a shower.    My own issue was with my room. I had an ""Upgraded"" king room and in the morning when I woke up I looked out the window....and to my surprise I saw a wall and an HVAC. Not too romantic on my /wedding week/honeymoon. Also it was so loud outside of our room that we could barely sleep at night. Wehn I did ask to finally move on Tuesday I was told ""No"" and the front desk person left it at that."
40,Initially we had some issues with the safe and TV but the staff was able to turn things around quickly so it made for a good experience. If you want a view - make sure you check before accepting the room (we were on 2nd floor)
50,Stayed in one of the pyramid elite suites  was a stubbing room absolutely massive  elevators very close to check in desk and all facilities very accessible housekeeping did an excellent job every day cannot thank them enough another amazing trip to vegas and the luxor cannot wait to go back
30,The casino has an unpleasant smell. Room was fine for the cost using comps but was disappointed that the room didn't have a refrigerator. Glad that we could use the pool next door at the Mandalay Bay since Luxor's pool wasn't opened yet.
50,I had the pleasure of staying at the Luxor this past March (2022). The rooms were tastefully decorated and very clean. The staff was absolutely wonderful! They were friendly and extremely helpful. We ate at all the restaurants there and was happily satisfied. I would highly recommend staying there. It was a great experience!!!
50,Just stayed at the luxor in the tower and the room was decent size and enjoyed the stay. Yes it's a older hotel but getting around the casino and the staff made it a pleasant experience. They are renovating the rooms slowly but definately worth a try.
20,We stayed here for a soccer tournament as a team. I did not know about the diagonal elevator but the worst part was how long the wait was all the time for an elevator going up and down. There was not enough towels for four people even though I booked a room for four people. The toilet had leftovers from the prior guest which was gross. When we asked for more linens however they were delivered quite properly which was a pleasant surprise. When we reported the dirty toilet to the front desk we were given a room credit for food and drinks so that was good. The hotel and casino definitely need more updates and a little brighter lighting. And while I wish we were closer to the main part of the strip it was not so bad where we were located.
40,The Luxor hotel staff was great! Our 2-Queen tower room was nice and roomy. The casino was good but rather smokey. The brunch buffet was very good and the Pyramid Cafe is excellent for breakfast. There are also 2 Starbucks.
10,look at my previous comment i dont feel like typing the nightmare all over again thanks ok fine mold smell wacky repairs in the bathroom app doesnt work elevators suck ac sucked stayed in the pyramid
50,Really enjoyed the stay and safety! Enjoyed the food and people games where very nice customer service was highly amazing can’t wait to go back. The building was clean very nicely built and amazing store to shop
50,My friend and I always love staying at this hotel because of its Egyptian theme and images used around the property. It is our favorite hotel. The Queen beds in the pyramid premier rooms are very soft!!
50,I stayed in one of the penthouses on the top floor in the east tower. It was perfect I absolutely enjoyed everything! I would go back with my family location was perfect too! Staff was friendly and the property was clean. Most likely will return!
20,Elevator broke during whole trip. Paid for room upgrade with hot tub in window . Hot tub had no running hot water. They did do a price correction but money wasn't the issue. Overall not a good good experience.
20,Trip was over all great besides the problems i had with my room…. Casino and spa and pool was great tho ….. tender is a place you must go and eat at very good….. not to far from airport or fermont st.
10,Smelled bad and room was nasty. Service was not what we wanted and couldn’t get any help. Wish we would have stayed somewhere else that was clean and didn’t smell. My food smelled like the sewer from the Casino.
20,The Hotel/Resort was great as long as I was not in my room. The room smelled of marijuana really bad the TV remote did not work TV only had 4 channels to scan thru and the Maintenance engineer came to the room at 1:07am while we were sleeping to try and fix it. After we let the desk know of the problem at around 7pm. We left a note as well for Housekeeping to try and help us and their note back to us said that is not their job.! Minor for the TV in Vegas- but Customer Service is KEY and that we did not get here. At the end of the day no matter the cost difference from others I will be going back to the Waldorf let alone just for the Customer Service.
50,Group of us went to Vegas together so we god a suite to hang our in maskless and coordinate meetups. Luxor booked the others in same tower (most on same floor). NOTE you must have key to a room on that floor for elevator access but we were able to use the app at the kiosk to generate extra room keys for others in our party. HIGHLY suggest downloading app and confirming ID before you arrive to use digital checkin and avoid the line.  The one bedroom elite suite has a main room. With a half bathroom bar area with fridge and coffee maker L shaped sofa and full sized table. Plenty of room for the 10 of us to gather. Since sleeping room has French doors others were able to use suite for morning gathering coffee and danish while we were still getting ready.  Hopefully you will not need to know they have a medic response team but rest assured it is available  The Rideshare drop off area is very convent much better placed then other casinos.
40,Friendly service from all staff and was relatively inexpensive. We also enjoyed the food options and although it is a bit south on the strip it wasn't an issue getting around. Two downsides were the wi-fi wasn't consistent and we may choose a non-smoking hotel next time. We enjoyed our stay.
30,This was a work trip so the room and amenities were what I needed. It was not a luxurious vacation. The room was clean and the staff was kind and helpful. The elevator was a bit sketchy and the digital room key often did not work on the elevator.
20,Elevators were awful. There were 4 in our tower and 2 or 3 were broken our entire stay. Sometimes had to wait 20 minutes for an elevator. The internet/wifi was also horrible. It didn't work in the room at all. The room clean though.
50,There is so much to do in this area and the stay is pretty awesome. Recommend to anyone who is trying to look for either a family trip solo trip or even a couples trip. I definitely recommend the Johnny Rockets in the food court!
30,Oldest property close to convention center but looking its age. MGM not doing anything to make up for it like better amenities in the room would help. No closet space and safe was broken. No issues with service people were great.
40,Nice place overall. Not so close to the busy area of the strip but close enough for walking tours along Las Vegas Blvd. Built in entertainments were good. The rooms aren't exactly sound proof and the smell when entering the hotel could be improved.
40,we love the luxor very friendly staff and just a great place to stay. we have been going there for many years ( 3-4 times a year) and have had a awesome time there. If you want a great place to eat try the backstage grill
10,Disappointed at how shabby the hotel was. Being quite close the the strip and tourist areas it could use a deep clean and maybe some updates. The outlet under the night stand didn’t hold a phone charger it kept falling out. No outlets near anything to plug electronics into leaving the option to place them in the floor or use a suitcase to hold the item.
10,Suite I was given (room26120) had AC problems. Room was hot and musky! After 3 calls to the customer service desk and 2 and a half hours later I was finally given another room! Can’t believe how their maintenance workers take so long in even checking out the problems! Oh almost forgot the mobile key card doesn’t work well in elevators or parking entrance/exit
30,Keycards were spotty at best. App on the phone only worked when the doors were opened(guessing because of the Wi-Fi)and that was if it was empty enough to get to the door to make your floor selection in time.
20,Like in the title the hotel itself was good decent rates some good cheap eats friendly staff and overall was a decent experience. However the main reason I will not return to the Luxor was because of an incident in the early morning of March 12 2022.    We came back to our room after a night on the strip and found lots of our personal items missing including 2 suitcases full of clothes an iPad Nintendo Switch ray bans 2 air pods jewelry etc. Roughly estimating to about $5000 worth of items missing. Safe to say we were shook up and felt violated. we first contacted Luxor Security and they were quick to respond and were quite helpful. I wrote down all the necessary information that they can take back to the front desk. Then we contacted Metro to report a burglary and they arrived about an hour and a half after we contacted them. After talking to Metro and reporting our incident we decided to call it a night not before switching rooms.    The next day they gave us our whole stay comped which was expected but still grateful nonetheless. I've also been told this is not a Luxor problem for break ins and thefts this is a Las Vegas problem and something needs to change to make me feel safe in Vegas again. From here on out I'm going to invest in a baby monitor or some sort of camera that we can put in any hotel room we stay at. I also recommend not being on the 1st floor cause anyone can be on the ground floor without a hotel key.    Overall the staff was friendly and responsive the hotel itself had lots of things to do with good eats the room itself was clean just a bit outdated in the pyramid rooms but because of the experience getting our items stolen I will personally not stay again at the Luxor.
50,There is so much to do in this beautiful place. I stayed for 5 days and had so much fun. Check out the museums inside so fun. The Pyramid Cafe has some of the best food. There is a shopping area inside and a night club. You really can do a lot. I enjoyed the Spa they gave me a massage that put me to sleep. They have a Gym you can go to and much more. For the price of the rooms they should include a coffee maker and refrigerator especially for someone srating 5 days.
50,Great place to stay rooms were very clean and comfortable highly recommend the Luxor for your stay I was there on a business trip and check in was a breeze as well as the front desk staff were very helpful
50,On the Vegas strip. Close to everything and reasonably priced. Starbucks in the hotel was great and it was very easy to get to Excalibur and Mandalay Bay without having to leave the property. Would definitely stay here again for work or just for fun
10,Check in took over 1.5 hours. The line had over 50+ people waiting and at certain times no one was at the front desk helping. The mobile check in app didn’t work. They told us that the rooms were still being cleaned - yet it was 11pm at night. Worst experience of my life we will never return.
40,I really didn’t have any major issues my room was clean. It was pretty noisy outside my door. I visual could see the cleaning staff completing proper cleaning to each room. I actually walked in on house keeping scrubbing my shower. I thought that was impressive.
50,I have stayed a few times at Luxor first time that I booked with MGM app which made things much easier. I have stayed there for my bachelor party and other previous events. I will definitely be coming back.
10,The rooms suck. The AC is broke in nearly every room. We stayed at three rooms during our stay. No mini fridge! No coffee maker! No microwave! This hotel has decided to totally disregard the customers comfort. I would rather stay at the strat.
10,Don't think you are staying here for the cost of the room. They add on resort fees deposit fees parking fees. our room had no coffee pot or clock and the sink drain and shower drain ran very slow. it is at the end of the strip and a long walk from the parking to check in.
20,Room was not very clean and toilet based leaked. Had issues with key and getting into my room when I checked in. First time at hotel usually stay at MGM. Have trip booked in July and now thinking of staying somewhere else.
40,I stayed in a pyramid premium two queen suite. The room was very nice and very spacious. The main areas of the hotel were very nice but other areas like the corridors and lifts were looking tired. The lady at check in was very helpful and arranged an extra bed to be brought to our room. The buffet was excellent value for money
50,I usually stay here every two months to relax and unwind. Its location at the end of the Strip is definitely a plus making it easy to get to without fighting traffic as well as making it one of the cheapest places on the Strip and who doesn't like sleeping in a pyramid?
30,The bathroom filter was completely black and needed a proper clean. The TVs did not work and there are no mini fridges. Overall the housekeepers were all friendly and as we walked by they all acknowledge us and said hello
30,We were expecting something comparable to Mandalay Bay’s service quality cleanliness and amenities way overpriced for the offerings elevators not working properly. This was supposed to be a Edward for our timeshare meeting and purchase felt slightly insulted especially when we paid over $350 for one extra night.
50,Polite hotel staff each staff member treats you like a person and not just another number like some of the other big hotels in the area. Even if issues arose (small issues) they were taken care of promptly
50,Always stay at luxor. Best time for me. Buffet diablos table games are all the best to me. Games were loosening this trip. Took the boys to the fantasy show and it was a blast. Can't wait to go back.
50,Excellent and comfortable stay! Fast and convenient check in! Housekeeping staff were very helpful and friendly! Parking was also convenient. When we got lost. Staff helped and ensured we got to our room.
10,There were so many things wrong with the Luxor that there’s not enough space to describe them. From being given the wrong room not being being able to order food to go from any of the restaurants to take back to the room since none were open to the MGM App not working to phone calls to front desk that were never answered my 1 night stay was horrible
10,This used to be a great place to stay. The rooms were very disappointing and outdated. I would not stay there again unless they invest in updating the rooms and inclinators. The Blue Man Grouo show was the highlight of the stay. The peeling paint and ceilings lack of refrigerator coffee maker and safe along with outdated electric/no tech sockets were all very disappointing.
30,The idea of paying for parking and fees for amenities that I'll never use is folly. You'll get the money - I just double these fees and take the total off of what I planned to gamble. I usually save (or make) money that way
10,This hotel is dirty and run down. 2/4 elevators were broken for my stay there. Happened to be the side that a majority of the people were staying. So as you can imagine it took forever to get an elevator. The elevators were dirty and smelled of urine. The maintenance doors kept swinging open and were covered in graffiti. There were spills in the hallways to the elevator without caution signs. The hotel is lucky that no one slipped and sued. The hot water for the shower took 30 minutes to heat up. When checking out of the hotel we had to leave through the emergency exit because the elevator wouldn’t go to the sixth floor.
50,From check in to check the overall experience was great. The staff was friendly and helpful. The room was clean and well maintained. The location of the property was convenient and made it easy and quick to get where I needed to go.
10,Took 8 hours to get our room (checked in at 1 pm and didn’t get our room until 9pm). Place is pretty run down and rooms were big but old. The elevators took a really long time so be prepared to wait to get to your room.
50,We had a two queen beds room which was clean & comfortable and roomy Bathroom was also clean and stocked with normal hotel amenities. Anything you needed housekeeping was very responsive. We only use our room for sleep and showers so our expectation is that everything is clean and comfortable.
40,Decent place to lay your head. Quiet end of blvd. 15th floor rooms were very quiet could not hear other guests at all! No fridge or coffee in rooms so not comfortable enough for extended stay or staying with kids. Elevators definitely need some doors and covers tightened but I didn’t feel in danger from the elevator crashing at all and I do not like “normal” elevators!
30,Long walk from elevators to room. Digital room key must be pulled up before getting on the elevator because you won't have service inside. 2/3 elevators were down on 2b. Showers were luke warm on hottest setting.
10,This room was dirty it’s gross. Lots of hair in the bathtub and hair all over the floor. Also no safe in the room and only a thin sheet on the bed. The AC turns off in the middle of the night so you can hear those around you.
20,This is the first time have stayed at Luxor in over 15 years. Definitely is Outdated and understaffed. The TVs don’t come in even clear enough to comfortable watch. If you need to get ahold of front desk be prepared for a 25 plus min hold. Bring you own Lysol as we found pubic hairs in over sized soaking tub.
40,Stayed at the Luxor to attend the Academy of Country Music Awards at Allegiant Stadium. The location was ideal due to easy access to the pedestrian bridge to walk to the event. The bridge is closed down to cars a few hours prior to the event. It was so convenient to walk to and from the event. There was a large crowd of people so it was safe and alot of fun. The hotel was pretty clean comfortable and affordable. I'll definitely stay at Luxor again any time I go to Allegiant Stadium.
50,We stay in the tower not the pyramid. Rooms are great. The lobby at luxor is amazing definitely a photo op. The location on the strip is not the best but there are many ways to get around trams monorail and busses.
10,Check in very long line and poor unequipped room No fridge no coffee machine No alarm clock mold on shower door magnet key failed to work in elevator multiple times game table are very limited .
10,Upon arriving our hotel room was surrounded by trash from the maids. It stayed overnight. That first night we did not sleep due to a rattling in the AC unit. The showers have been remodeled and they do not keep the water in! There was a pool of water on the floor after each shower. Upon request they front desk comped us a $50 food credit for our troubles only to never apply it to our account! After getting a new room on the 12th floor the shower still had this problem. In addition there appeared to be only two working (and very shaky) elevators that struggled to stop on the 12th floor. We spent two nights riding up and down the elevator hoping it might stop on the 12th floor. It was absolutely awful. To check out  we waited upwards of 40 minutes to fix the credit that they said was applied to our account. We love MGM properties but this one is one we won't return to.
30,The Luxor has a great casino and food/drink offerings as well as a good variety of shows to see. You also have easy access to neighboring hotels such as New York New York Excalibur and Mandalay Bay. It is a beautiful structure that is clean and well-maintined.    My room was just average. I was in a West Tower Premium Room on the first floor. Upon walking in the room was very clean and welcoming. The bathroom was nice and it had both a shower and a separate soaking tub which my wife enjoyed. The beds however were a bit on the uncomfortable side and it took my wife and I a while to finally get to sleep. The walls are also paper thin and you can hear everything next to and above your room. We were also woken up by loud bass music coming from somewhere at 4:00am so beware of staying in a room that is near the night club or a ballroom/reception hall.    Despite the sleeping difficulties the overall experience was a good one. I would definitely come back to the casino and restaurants but I will probably try out other hotels on the strip before booking another night here.
20,I’ve been to Luxor 2 years ago for a conference. Paid for a 2 queen beds room. The room then was good clean modern had a bathtub. This time for the same price I was expecting a similar experience. But no. The room was old  no tub with a huge stain on the ceiling. Looked like a Motel 6 room…. :/ I was disappointed and confused by the lack of consistency with room quality X price. Won’t be coming back.
40,Check-in had to be done in person because of an issue with the app but it was still fast & efficient. Check-out was done by the t.v. in the room. Easy! Rooms were clean and kept that way. The front desk was helpful in a couple of requests. We will return!
40,Stayed in East tower Luxor. Clean rooms. Efficient friendly staff. Good food. Disappointed that they charge for parking. Elevators are fussy need some maintenance. Mobile check in is easy. Using phone for elevator and room check worked after several tries but the key card is better so ended up standing in line for the front desk anyway.
30,We came down from Michigan for a fun filled week of a 39th birthday day and a friends wedding. The front desk seemed like they didn't wanna help us get a couple rooms together or atleast on the same floor but all they wanted was to upgrade the room so we had to pay more. The sewer smell on the gaming floor was bad and got worse throughout the week. The missing pieces on the elevator and in our shower the missing door which caused the water to spray out on the floor causing a slip and fall accident. Also the peeling wallpaper in the halls of the tower rooms. The elevator doors not opening all the way amd having to open them by hand.
30,The hotel overall was decent i had a great time with my gf and our friends but the casino staff was absolutely terrible they completely ruined my experience by being so rude and never serving me on the gaming floor when i gambled everywhere else i had a drink in my hand every 5 minutes
50,The Luxor stands as one of the most accessible hotels from the airport strip standing proudly besides the Excalibur Mandalay and MGM Grand as one of the more affordable yet luxurious hotels on the strip. This iconic landmark stands out from a distance and is one of the major factors that make Las Vegas what it is: A mixture of luxury excess and tackiness put together in a functional and fun way that is meant to create memorable moments and unforgettable sights. It is very much distressing to consider that this hotel will be destroyed for the sake of another stadium being built especially considering it houses one of the few accessible E-Sport stadiums I've ever seen in a populous area. It's location may be furthest from some of the hotels on the opposite end of the strip but the comfort of being so close to the airports more than makes up for this downside.
20,The parking lot to the hotel one helluva walk. Trust me. Then it’s a pain looking for registration desk. Once there there is always a huge line. Service was quick and fast. Not to much explanation of anything of what you’re paying for. They upsell you the room cuz they haven’t upgraded the lower rooms for 25 years. The new remodeled rooms don’t look that much better. The beds were nice even though the bed was very low to the ground. The bathroom didn’t look that upgraded. If it was horribly done. Now the price for these hotels are usually the cheapest on the strip and they still are but it wasn’t worth it for the price. If you’re living on a budget this will do. You do have to give up a lot just for this hotel. I think the upgrade to another nicer hotel located in the middle of the strip would be worth your dollars. Sometimes you gotta splurge a little bit for a nicer experience and room.
30,It’s was ok minus the unclean room. And the fact you couldn’t regulate the temperature of the room. I do wish they would provide cups in the rooms. The rest of the week the room was clean that was a plus
40,"Room was large clean and the bathroom was great. The location is great as the Luxor is directly connected to both the Excalibur and Mandalay Bay and walking distance to the new Raiders stadium as well as the Strip. What keeps this from a five rating are: no free parking no room fridge and that pesky ""Resort Fee"". Pool was not available ."
50,Lovely experience the my Vegas app really lives up to expectations so many people were using the app for slot credit luxour buffet is way better than Excalibur just my opinion staff friendly and welcoming the casino only needs more hand despensers throughout the casino the ones they did have was empty seemed like every time I went they were always empty so definitely don't forget to bring your own hand sanitizer as I did the only disappointment I experienced is I didn't receive any birthday promotions at all disappointing for my first visit other than what I mentioned lovely experience and the buffet hours should be extended
20,Starting off with the good the room remodel is very nice. Not impressed with the half glass door shower. Water goes everywhere. Now the bad ELEVATORS! Two of the 4 elevators in our elevator bank did not work. Then the digital key would not work in the elevator to get to your floor. No stairs you can use!! All of the staircases are marked emergency use! This hotel is definitely showing its wear.    Finally went to check out and had a small issue with the bill. Our Public house restaurant bill came through as full price when we actually had a $20 comp. They said there was nothing they could do about it because it was two different departments. Then why did I have to sign for a room charge? Finally spoke with a manager Bianca Campbell hotel operations manager. She went over to the public house to get a copy of the bill. She comes back with a printed copy she got not the receipt I signed. And the proceeded to call me a lier basically. Finally after I said I would not pay the bill at all unless she produced my signed receipt she finally took the $20 off threw the receipt at me and walked away from me as she said I took it off as a courtesy and went to the back room.    This is all after we had spent thousands of dollars in the casino. Why on earth would I fight about a $20 comp when I have spent thousands in the casino? It became just about the point of the issue. You have a thief of a server who took the discount off the bill and pocketed the money.
40,We just finished a 6 night stay at the Luxor. The room was clean and comfortable and provided excellent value. The public house and the Ri-Ra were good places to eat. Connected to Mandalay Bay essentially doubles the dining shopping and gambling opportunities. Great trip!
50,Our room was clean and had a lot of room. Wish there was a fridge microwave and coffee maker in the room but none of the resorts do. . The shower doesn't have a door and a lot of water gets on the floor. These were minor problems. There were lots of shops restaurants and shows at the resort.
40,Loved it here. Only thing I would say is that we came with a block group and we weren’t able to stay on the same floor. That was probably the hardest part of our stay. Otherwise that we loved our time there.
20,I was really expecting a nicer room. The beds were fine not great. but the floors needed a good shampooing. There were stains all over the carpet it felt dirty. The caulking around the tub appeared to have mold and there were bugs ( beetles) every day in the bathroom. This was my first time in the Luxor. I was expecting to have more of an Egyptian type room. 90% of the time the app on my phone for the door key wouldn't work. We got in one elevator and the thing to scan your card was broken. I didn't see clear directions on how to get to your room. We used the self check in and didn't know we had to be in a certain elevator to go up. We ate breakfast our last morning there at the Pyramid Cafe and I ordered the Steak and Eggs I couldn't even chew my steak. the french toast sucked. sad day.
50,Amazing construction. Once you get up to your floor and see it from the inside it’s magical.  The staff is very helpful and welcoming. Our room was ready very early eliminating the need to check our luggage with the bell staff.  Only thing missing was more drink service on the casino floor.
10,This was the dirtiest room I have ever stayed in. No soap provided. Tables were sticky. Floor was filthy with trash and food left by the beds. Pre check in on the app and electronic room key is a joke. I will never stay here again.
40,Good hotel clean rooms and great location! I came here for my boyfriend’s birthday and we really enjoyed the amenities. They have great show inside the hotel and the Bodies exhibition is amazing! The check in is slow but there’s an “in app” check in option available.
30,There are no extras at this hotel. You really don’t get anything for the resort fee. The shower wouldn’t drain so we had to turn off the water part way through so it wouldn’t overflow onto the bathroom floor. The refrigerator had been removed there was no inside lock on the room door. Front desk doesn’t answer. Off the main strip a bit. Room was clean hotel was not smokey. We didn’t pay a lot so I guess you get what you pay for.
50,I was in town for a conference with my wife. Sue Laforce did an excellent job as did the rest of the staff other than housekeeping. I left a request for extra coffee with a tip every morning. The first two days the did a good job the second two days they left a used coffee bag in the coffee maker and not even 2 servings of regular coffee.
40,The Luxor is a pretty good resort. Reasonable budget extremely nice spa and good rooms. The showers in the rooms were literally the greatest showers I’ve ever used the water pressure was unreal.    Only problem was the constantly broken slow as hell elevators.
20,Good location in city and decent beds but that is where the positives stop. Problems with check in room service (daily cleaning and more towels etc...) elevators and navigating around the hotel and casino.
10,Maintenance issues Hotel is very dated. Elevators were not cleaned seem like forever. Wall paper in our room was falling off the walls. We had a garden tub in our room that dripped non stop and it didn’t drain so it had nasty water in it all the time.
50,Our room had a great view toward the north! The patient and polite staff helped us check in using the self check-in feature. Our room was clean and comfortable so we had a good night's rest. The price was right for us. We would definitely stay here again.
50,The price per night was great on the budget. We had a conference and the location was easy to access the Convention Center at Mandalay Bay. We used the spa/salon quite often and it was amazing! We will stay here again when we come back for the conference.
10,WAAAAAAAAY too much money for what you get. and a $200 security deposit? i’m not sure anyone could tell if the room was “trashed” since it was trash from the beginning. everything: the carpets the smells the elevators that didn’t work no minibar no coffee in room no room service. just ridiculous. first and last time.
40,Courteous front desk. Helped all of our group get on one floor near each other. Casino is fun with lots of different types of games. They could use some new beds. Mine was quite uncomforable. Food court is lacking. Limited selections and very expensive. Excalibur is much better. Hotel location down the trip away from large crowds is nice feature.
10,I stayed at the Luxor because I was in town for a meeting and that’s where our reservations were made. I was dissatisfied with the quality of the guestroom and public areas. It’s very tired and in need of renovation. Also there was no blanket on the bed only a sheet and a very thin comforter
50,The rooms are so nice for the price they are. Very clean as well. Would recommend this. There’s also a lot of activities to partake in such as the titanic museum and the bodies museum both are very very cool.
50,I would love to go next time again and reserved the same room I got this time me and my husband had a good day even though we only was there for some hrs I would definitely recommend this hotel to my family
50,This is my second time staying at this hotel but it is my first time actually staying in the pyramid it’s a very unique and one of a kind of experience specially going up the elevators between floor 22 and above you’ll get to go on a certain diagonal that is very trippy. The rooms were very cleaned and sanitized and it smelled great! I definitely recommend for families or single people to stay at the Luxor hotel
30,The hotel atmosphere is very nice. I was upgraded to a Premium Pyramid room which was nice however NOT having a refrigerator in the room when there is a cabinet for one is totally unacceptable. Also the bathroom shower only has one door which is crazy. You have to place a towel on the floor to absorb the water that lands OUTSIDE the shower. Plus there is only ONE switch in the bathroom so when you turn on the light the bathroom FAN comes on and runs the entire time. That was so ANNOYING!
40,The hotel was nice and the rooms were clean. Great selection of restaurants and food. The entertainment offerings were good.  Great location. Wish the room had refrigerators or clean windows. The check in lines are very long and maybe could use more staff for that.
20,The “new” cellphone app left us stranded on the 20th floor we needed the 14th floor. Cell phone coverage is horrible. Elevator has open panels and card reader not working. Is this place going under? So bad compared to past stays. Showed my pearl card at the cafe and was told that doesn’t mean anything hear get in line.
20,The rooms were dirty and not cleaned the parking lot was very far from the hotel and there was a tremendous amount of Marijuana smell thru out the hotel and the restaurants closed to early which forced you to leave and deal with the parking lot issue. Overall this is a two star hotel.
40,Comp room. No fridge or microwave in room unaware of this upon booking the room. Bathroom sink has a slight clog which results in the water gurgling down. Aside from this the room was very clean and nice.
50,The room was great comforting beds clean. Check in and out was easy. The hotel had lots of dining choices the titanic and bodies exhibits were interesting. Gaming floor was big and clean. Everyone likes to hate on the Luxor but I enjoyed it and saw nothing wrong with it
20,For a two-night free compensated room that you only need to pay the taxes and resort fee ($80.00) it was less desirable than a Motel 6 with an overpriced store $30 for a 12 pack of beer and incompetent staff that charge you for items you did not purchase.
10,After staying in over 300 hotel the LUXOR is the first EVER with no coffee maker in the room. When i called the front desk i was told this 'amenity' is not offered. But i could get coffees at the STARBUCKS in the lobby. And we could for $4.95 for a regular coffee. Obviously i can only imagine someone made the decision to have ALL the coffee makers removed from MGM properties. so if a couple who drink four coffees a day each or 8 coffees @ $5.00 each (rounded from $4.95) in a four day stay two people you can add $160.00 in five dollar coffees to your stay at the LUXOR..
30,The digital check in process wasn't great or clear. The staff is friendly but the rooms are not the cleanest. The bed was clean but not that comfortable. I would say the towels smelled off as well. Hope this helps
50,I was there for Metallica weekend with my son and his friends and my brother my brother and I stayed with you and it was a beautiful awesome experience with your staff the room the bartenders The waitresses the restaurants casinos everything
30,Stayed in the West Tower -- Check in was flawless. Even though did thru the app I like real keys so went to desk when was app informed me room was ready.    First the elevators to the West Tower is a bit of a walk from registration. So if you have issues with walking would suggest you get the East tower.    You have to outsmart the elevator when you use your key. Hold it firm wait for green light leave it there and press your floor number firmly. Delay removing your finger. If you remove too soon then you are locked out for about a minute    The rooms show wear and tear but not unreasonable. The room was clean sheets clean temperature good HOT water excellent maid service -- depended on who was on -- but overall good.    Have been going to Las Vegas since 1990's -- different hotels different times. Of this level hotels enjoyed the Delano the best.
10,No tp 1 towel dirty room not room/floor requested. Staff members room had dried vomit on bed and blood in bathroom. Wall paper held down with duct tape. Called front desk multiple times with no answer.
40,Great location to be at for the strip and the downtown area. Good in-house amenities as well as tram access to other properties. Good buffet. Easy to check in and out. Access to a Starbucks was handy. Enjoyed the decor.
50,I stayed here for 3 nights with my 10yo son. We had a really good time. We stayed in the towers and it was really clean guests and staff were very friendly. COMFY FOOTWEAR IS A MUSTTT!!! This property is huge and it’s a lot of walking to get from 1 resort to the next being that it’s connected to Mandala Bay and Excalibur and from Excalibur you can walk to New York New York. We ate at the Luxor Buffet as well as The Buffer at Excalibur both were decent. Diablo has really good food as well. I also went to the spa which was a good experience as well. The walk to the center of the strip is a good distance but lots of stores and things to see on the way. Hope you have a good experience like we did!
30,No accommodations in any rooms minimal place to purchase much rooms are very clean but there is nothing else in the rooms to enjoy the night let alone being able to keep anything of a short day food supply or beverages
40,Had a good time but the elevators were a little confusing I think some of the buttons were broken was always going the wrong way. I would scan my card push the floor I wanted and go the other way or it would by pass my floor
50,Nice hotel and walking distance to most places right on the strip sports night life site seeing fun time  lots of beautiful women great sports book  a lot of adult fun what happens in vegas stays in vegas
30,Hotel is needing a little updating. Carpets are gross in the rooms. But needed proximity to Mandalay for conference. Beds have a body track that you get stuck in.... otherwise it was great. Housekeeping brought extra pillows and blankets upon request.
30,Always have a great stay at the Luxor with my wife! Only disappointment is that the buffet is only  Open until 3pm and only serves a brunch style experience…I wish the MGM resorts would open back the full time buffets with a separate breakfast lunch and dinner!
50,Luxor West Tower rooms were great! Big improvement from the room in another area of the hotel several years ago. Good selection of restaurants and slot machines. The property was clean and I felt safe! Wish they still had the Deal or No Deal slot machine.
40,Stayed at the Luxor to celebrate my spouse's birthday. It was an overall good experience. Most of the staff does a decent job at making you feel welcome. The only complaint would be with housekeeping operator who answered my call. She was not friendly at all sounded irritated. I only asked for a few extra towels and soap but she made it seem like I was asking for a home cooked meal and a bed time story. Other than that it was a nice stay.
40,Was A good experience Overall! The staff were super helpful that were there! probably a lil understaffed but with covid most places are so cannot really hold that against them! the App you can use to check in is fantastic! the one downside is if you have parking you will still need to get a card as your phone will not work in the garage to use the app.
40,The rooms are remodeled and clean . I love how it’s so easy abs accesible to go to Mandalay Bay to enjoy other restaurants. The monarail was a plus to take us to the Excalibur if we wanted to go visit . I will definitely stay at the Luxor again .
50,Excellent and funny trip to Vegas. Obviously stay in the best Resort and Casino like Excalibur. We have three amazing days. I had the best celebration for my fifty four years old and I hope to be there really very soon. Thx Excalibur for the amazing host.
50,The Luxor offers one of the strips best bang for your buck. There are several excellent restrictions in and around the area. The Luxor has current gambling machines. It would be great to see more progressive video poker machines.
40,My first time and it was very relaxing . They didn’t have the room I booked and they place me in a better one and gave me a credit for drinks and food. It was very relaxing hotel. I wish they have the movie theater open and more options after 12 to eat but other than that I’m everything was great.
50,I had a wonderful experience and I would recommend it to anybody who is looking for a stay in Las Vegas Nevada you will not be disappointed in the Luxor hotel my room was magnificent and the customer service was exceptional
50,Great stay at the Luxor. We received a free upgrade to a Pyramid Elite Suite. It was spacious and wonderful. The staff was great food was great it was the trip of a lifetime for my husband and I. I love the south end of the strip because it's quieter and we were only there for a quick 2 day trip. I always recommend Luxor their staff is fantastic.
40,This was my first time staying at the Luxor and it was a wonderful experience. Easy to access parking and elevators. My room was clean and the mobile check in went flawless. I will be staying again soon and will givd an update
50,We were here for business conference...nice rooms great price clean stayed here several times and won some money 💰 this time ....we will be back rooms we're cleaned always our work conference is here every Feb ...we all love it here ...convenient to other properties
10,This was the first part of our honeymoon trip. We chose the Luxor 1 for the price and 2 for the pools. On the website it said the pool was open from March-November. We stayed from March 1-5 and the pools were drained the entire time. Luxor also continued to recommend the mobile check-in. However the app wasn't working and we weren't able to check-in on it so we had to wait in the extremely long line. Once we got to the front the front desk person said the pool was closed but we could use Mandalay Bay's pool. The next day we went there and found Mandalay Bay's main pool was also closed. So everyone from the Luxor and Mandalay Bay were crammed into one tiny pool space on an 80 degree day.    The room was fine aside from not having a mini fridge coffee maker or microwave. Also the shower door was broken and room service never came.    Lastly when we checked out we had asked why we were being charged a resort fee when we didn't even have access to simple things like room amenities or the pool. The front desk person said those things weren't included and we were paying an extra $35/day for wifi and unlimited calling...Seriously? This was a very disappointing kick off to our honeymoon and pretty upsetting that they didn't try to make anything right for us.
50,I absolutely loved staying here the staff was beyond awesome an super kind which made my entire night! The slots were super fun an the food was delicious! The interior was beyond what I expected i was in aw the second i stepped outside the vehicle! But when i walked inside my breath was taken away… thank you so much for making my stay/birthday the best!
50,This is the 3rd time staying at the Luxor in the last 20 years and all I can say is that the rooms service and experience have only gotten better with each stay. We will stay here again in the future.
40,Check in to our room didn't go as plan due to it being dirty. But after a long wait missed dinner reservation and drive we just wanted to get in a room. The front desk finally fixed it we were able to enjoy the rest of our time. And Thank to the bartender Bruce at Centra we were able to forget all about it. He had the best drinks and costumer service.
30,The facility and staff where great our shower gurgled all night and our digital key was a nightmare in the elevator. When we went to get a card we had to wait for 45 minutes in line to get a card it was late at night and we were wiped out.
20,There are better options out there for hotel stays. Luxor is an old hotel building the rooms had ‘digital keys’ which never worked for the elevator and rooms the staff was not friendly (except for housekeeping) the bed was uncomfortable.
30,Average hotel room- biggest complaints are old uncomfortable mattresses with terrible TV picture with limited channels. No mini refrigerator or microwave. The staff were nice and it’s easy to walk to the Mandalay Bay convention center.
50,My Family has stayed several times at The Luxor and we have full intentions of coming back again as every staff member has gone above and beyond to make our stay so very enjoyable. Everything you want and need is at The Luxor!
20,A view of dumpsters literally on the casino floor.    Somehow we were granted the worst room in the place. It was on the first floor just along the edge of the casino area.  I made an attempt to speak with someone but the line was so long it was an impossible wait while on vacation.    Smoke came in under the door we couldn't open the curtain because the view was of a work area (with workers) and dumpsters etc. The bathroom fan did not work poorly done repairs hard water spots gave everything a cloudy look etc.  The cooling system could not be adjusted so we endured 65 degrees the entire trip (it was COLD in our room and the bedding was very thin).  There are many better places to stay in Vegas for the same amount of $.
30,The guest room was clearly dated and not cleaned well after previous guest. The staff was very nice and helpful. The location on the strip is kind of far from the busier areas. The pricing was good but I expected more honestly.
50,Our room was exceptionally clean! The staff was friendly and amazing! We had 2 corner suites in the pyramid. My niece was thrilled! We also went to the Titanic exhibit which was exceptional! Long line for check in of 2 room but it moved so fast! Not a problem at all!
30,Booked the Luxor because of proximity to the ACM Awards. The smell of cigarette smoke could not be missed. Security key issues was the discussion of most passengers on the elevators. My expectations were not met by this mid priced property. Would only consider again if attending an event at the stadium.
30,Rooms had outdated items mixed with renovated items. Shower was renovated except the shower head was old and had pressure issues. Toilet paper was about four feet away from the toilet and the sink made the walls make noise when turned on. Tub in corner suite was really old and the AC units need to be replaced. Outside of windows were dirty and prevented nice pictures
20,I expected way more from a casino hotel. Wallpaper was peeling off the walls in the hallway. AC was broke when we got into our room at 2 AM and it was 86 degrees in there. Was charged hidden and illegal resort fees at checkin that was not aware of beforehand. Paid for a casino room and got put in the tower. No mini fridge or microwave in the rooms either. Front Desk Staff is more combative than sympathetic.
20,To many things to let known in a text box. It was my wedding elopement and it was ruined by so many inconveniences and short coming from our stay. I wish it was a better experience over all. Since I don't really don't complain about much... this experience left a bitter sour memory of what was suppose to be my day to remember always.  #sadWIFEsadLIFE
50,I have been to Vegas many times and stayed at many hotels. Last year I stayed at Luxor in a one bedroom tower suite. This trip I had a pyramid suite. while the room in the tower are more modern I would stay in the pyramid again. I asked for a lowerr floor and my room was convenient to the elevator casino and deli. It was clean and quiet. Even after Sturday night partiers took over the casino there were no drunken people laying on the floor like at other places. (MGM Grand)    Another thing I noticed the casino was for adults. Too many times (Excalibur) you would have moms or dads playing slots with their young childnre at the machine at their side. I actually witnessed security stopping a young boy from hanging out.    I would go here again. I love Luxor.
50,It was our first time in Vegas didn't know what to expect. The experience was amazing. So much things to do. From the casino experience to shows events the adventures outdoors as well. Our only regret was that the trip was not longer. We love it
30,Sometimes great sometime bad you never know what your going to get it’s really run down in some rooms perfect in others wallpaper peeling off everywhere trash was never picked up doors are so bad I can’t even describe
50,I have to say this hotel staff is very friendly and helpful. And the hotel is very pretty. Since this was my daughter's 21 birthday and her first time at Las Vegas. She love the hotel. Thank you very much to make her birthday very special. :)
50,you always treat me well and /i have fun brought friends this year and they liked their stay also!!! was pretty business but was taken care of pretty quickly love the registration lady was very helpful.
40,Stayed in the North Tower in their Premium King Room and really enjoyed it. Housekeeping was outstanding the rooms clearly updated & newer and stayed in room 20249 over looking the pools n Las Vegas mountains. Great fun casino excellent restaurant choices including an American Bistro type open 24/7/365 for hot & cold Sammiches soups salads and fries. Loved The Blueman Group there and Diablos Cantina exceeded our expectations w great food and hand crafted cocktails. Rooms are small one bathroom sink and limited drawers for a weeks clothes. The perfect stay if you're walking to Alegiant Stadium for a concert or game. We saw Billy Joel and it was a very safe 15 minute walk strolling. Great smelling casino and we'd come back for sure. Don't listen to the negative reviews here....this hotel was clean responsive loaded w amenities knowing its not a High End & Expensive Resort. 4 solid stars!
20,Dirty casino. Elevators don’t work properly. Some elevators weee down completely. There was a mason jar full of throw up left on my radiator when i checked into my room . Would not recommend this hotel to anyone.
50,Was an awesome experience and hope to be back soon. Want to see more of what's to offer and will recommend the Loxor to anyone. If you get to Vegas and want a 1st rate time check put the Loxor it is a class act..
40,Overall we had a good time only one thing was the TV in the room didn’t work when we needed to just relax for a bit. Great atmosphere & friendly staff. I have no problems booking the Luxor again in the future.
10,We booked a Tower Premium King Room for over $300 a night out the door after parking resort fees taxes etc. and that was for a Saturday-Monday stay. We expected nice furnishings a great view plush towels a table and chairs maybe even a bottle of water or two. We arrived to find the parking lot small and crowded the WIFI spotty the bed was broken and pushed away from the headboard the towels were small rough and had zero fluff. The AC unit made a knocking noise every 10-15 minutes. The view from the 14th floor was of the casino roof and AC units and one side of the pyramid. We're going back to Las Vegas in a couple of months and will be staying at the Palazzo which is about the same cost but 10x better rooms.
20,Our thermostat was stuck at 85 degrees all day and night. Our room smelled of cigarettes all night long and the next morning our ceiling was leaking water above us. We did get moved to a new room but was very inconvenient.
30,You don't have a way to refrigerate your medications. There is no microwave coffee pot or refrigerator. The goal is for you to spend in Vegas. There is no way to store medications. The good is that the staff is friendly.
30,The room was nice and the employees were friendly when engaged. The problem we had was that housekeeping did not clean and restock our room for 3 days. Our trash was overflowing and we did not have clean towels. We called housekeeping each day and they said that they would put us on the list but when we returned each day the room was untouched. We had to call for new towels and toilet paper each day and had to wait 45 minutes to an hour for someone to bring us supplies.
30,"Room was great! Clean and bed was comfortable. I was pleasantly surprised by how stylish the room was.  Unfortunately the staff was not as expected for a fun Vegas vacation. Almost seemed like a bunch of zombies. They were bothered when asked questions. Even simple ones like ""where in the hotel can we get coffee?"""
30,Great location on the strip. The most comfortable hotel bed I have ever slept in the bed is a 10 without a doubt.  Down side the shower design allows water to nearly flood the bathroom every time. The elevator are worn and need attention.
20,Bad rooms didn’t get what we paid for hotel room even flooded and we got moved to a downgraded room that was very dirty. Other then that good experience besides check in and self parking with your own bags
10,I was very disappointed in the room. I took one showers and while I was showering the bottom filled with black water from the drain. I literally slipped jumping out the shower. When I went to go wash my feet in the sink the sink didn’t drain either and left a gross residue around the sink. It took almost 24 hours for it to be taken care of
30,In addition to no cup or glass not a single one nothing to use while brushing my teeth. Missing screw in the close-up mirror. Skimpy on bath items. No fridge no scale few towels no coffee maker no room service no food vending machines. However the room was clean and comfortable and quite spacious.
50,This girl has everything you need right here at this hotel! Would definitely recommend! The staff are very helpful and knowledgeable with everything that you too enjoy your stay in the best possible way!
40,Room was clean but the sink was plugged. Engineer showed up to fix while we were away sinked was fixed but portion of material removed was not cleaned up on sink.  Elevator card reader did not work in one elevator and control panel was almost ready to fall off  like the Luxor hotel but needs some remodeling
50,The Luxor was great. My room was actually ready really early so if I wanted to I could check in early. I actually did mobile check in and that made my stay so much better. My room was beautiful and spacious. I had the two queen and a living suite in the Pyramid corner tower. Luckily my room was also right by the elevators. That help a lot considering I had many luggage's and bags from shopping. I really enjoyed the casino. I'm a slot player so I used the slots many times. My siblings loved the tables. Also the staff is so friendly. Everyone I came in contact with was outstanding. I visited the buffet the cafe the steakhouse and also the food court and the food and drinks were amazing. The Luxor is on the strip but not quite in the middle of the strip like other resorts. It's connected to both the Mandalay Bay and Excalibur. The Luxor is a great location. I'll definitely be back. Thank you.
10,I was dissatisfied with my stay at Luxor. Mainly with the cleanliness and the state of the hotel room. The location was great for me and was the only redeeming quality. They were also going to charge me at least an additional $15 for a late checkout that was one hour later.
20,First room couldn’t sleep people loud in the next room over the moved me to the tower at 2am and that was worse people had a full night club going in 9334 had to call security 3 times wasn’t able to get test for work and elevator 48 is broken we got stuck for 15 mins
40,MGM comp our 4 night stay. Cost about 180 out the door. Lots of awesome games. 40 free pay 100 dollar resort credit. All and all good time. I was there for a conference had to take a taxi and or the free tram.
10,The Luxor needs an upgrade. Hot water runs out no coffee pot no USB plugs air conditioning was barely tolerable and it's March. For the money you will spend you might as well be somewhere more modern and comfortable.
10,Poor choice of a room when you have plenty of other options on the strip. Sad recuse l excuse of rooms casino floor had a sewer smell issues all around. Location is far south on strip and the view was dark and depressing....
40,We had a good trip the luxor was not a highlight but was a good place to rest and affordable. I would have liked to see it be cleaner but it wasn't gross. I would stay there again because of the price but would like to stay more center strip
50,Goregous had a great time family loved it the casino was nice and the shops and restaurants were amazing I can't wait to come back again the spa was so nice and the staff was so nice and helpful and check out was easy
20,Not a nice feeling when you come into a room that smell. And there is no ventilation around for that smell to go away. Will not recommend nor going back to this place for stay. But traveling to the strip was very comfortable as we had easy accesses to tram station and bus stop which is just opp to hotel.
20,Old rooms expensive meals entire place smelled like an ashtray. No coffee in room. No mini fridge. Forced to buy coffee for $10 a cup. Family of 4 and spent on average $80 per meal. Paid for late check out but maid barged into our room at 9 am. Wish we would have stayed at Southpoint again.
30,Stayed for convenience to Stadium. Hotel seems old. No coffee in the rooms. Limited access to restrooms in the casino. The bed was comfortable. Pricing was so/so. Definately convenient to the new Raider Stadium.
50,Came here as a kid with my parents in 1999 and 2003 and it was awesome. Decided to check it out as an adult in 2022 and it was still awesome. It was clean fun affordable and rowdy enough to be exciting but quiet enough to be able have an intimate conversation. My wife and I had a blast.
40,We Go for grand daughters Vegas Open dancesport competition every year. Great service and location in the hotel for the dance competition. Can’t wait for bar service in slot area gets back to normal.. needs more help.
40,The room was great the only thing is that it smelled like cigarettes. Plus our room didn't have a door lock so if someone came in by mistake it would be easy for them to get in. Over all the hotel in general was fun and the atmosphere was great.
50,The atmosphere at this location is simply great and they have spacious rooms.  Would recommend to get a room in the first level though that way you are not stuck minutes for an elevator.  This place is connected to the other MGM locations Excalibur and Mandalay Bay:
20,Rooms were not clean. We stayed a week and only thing they would change is our towel. Glass cups bed bathroom never got cleaned. No fridge no coffee maker. We had the strong odor of Marijuana overtake our room made us feel sick when we were in our rooms. Bars and restaurants close at 10pm in the beginning of the week close later on weekends so apparently only people who stay on weekends get hungry! Not worth it would not recommend.
10,Originally booked a 2 bedroom penthouse for my wedding party to get ready.  Groom and groomsmen to get ready in one room and bride and bridesmaids in the other. Upon check in they told me my room that I had booked months in advance was no longer available due different reasons. They had to downgrade me to a 1 bedroom penthouse that was alot smaller ac did not work properly so it was hot and tub was leaking as well as the sink.  Grooms had to wash up in a small bathroom sink and get ready in that bathroom so we could leave the 1 bedroom to the bride.  Very dissatisfied.
30,The hotel is in a great location and there is a tram that can take you to the other hotels which is amazing if you don’t have a car but AC in my room didn’t work and it was so dusty and I didn’t have a fridge in my room also.
50,The hotel and casino was great I always choose luxor as main hotel when I go to vegas cleaning could be a bit better I give the luxor hotel and casino a 9/10 the price is very cheap and rooms are better than other hotels in the strip.
30,Nothing bad to say overall the stay was pretty moderate. Room was moderately cleaned but to be expected from a massive hotel. Check in was a breeze with the app. Nothing too spectacular about the rooms. I would suggest the tower rooms if you stay.
30,Pros: Amazing location easy access to strip Towers has private entrance/elevators connects with Mandalay Bay    Cons: room cleanliness was questionable at best water leaks in the west tower hallway created a musty smell in the hallway. That happens… but we were there 4 days and no attempts to dry the carpet or clean it occurred?? Smell was horrible.
10,Room is outdated walls are thin smells like it hadn’t been cleaned in a while. Stayed at a few different hotels this trip and luxur by far was the worst. Even coming in there wasn’t any wow factor compared to other Mgm brand hotels
40,They fix a room problem due to it being dirty after a long wait. But the bartender at centra made us forget all about it. Go Bruce. He make the best drinks and has the best service. Make sure you see him when your at the luxor. You won't be disappointed.
50,The hotel is one of the older hotels. It’s clean well maintained and the staff were all ver accommodating during my 4 day business stay. I ate at restaurants coffee shops and had the buffet. All were very nice. You get what you pay for in Vegas. This is worth it.
10,Double charged for room was told they couldn’t do anything about it and front desk staff told me they wouldn’t allow me to speak with a manager to resolve what seemed to be a simple issue. I would have been okay with this hotel if they did the right thing.
40,In town Tues-Sat for PAC 12 basketball tournament at Mich Ultra arena. Rates were extremely good compared to MandBay and it was a quick walk to the games. Rooms were ok but they were dark at night and the beds were very comfortable. Backstage Deli had delicious and more reasonably priced.
50,The elevators were a trip but fun once I found out why it moved the way it did. The room I had was beautiful but very far from the elevators. The casino had a lot of games but not too many waiters and waitresses for drinks. I had only two drinks in four days I stayed.
10,Started with getting room key got all the way up to the room and found out it wasn’t cleaned. Went downstairs got a new room.  That one had new sheets but the room wasn’t clean it was very outdated with heavy caulking around bathroom and mold on it .  Came back after touring city at 1am to find my key didn’t work anymore.  Front desk started asking me questions like I’m trying to break into someone else’s room. Lady was very rude. I asked for manager (Logan) the most unprofessional person in Vegas. With an attitude got me into my room. That’s when I snapped and told him I will not be talked to that way and then with a smirk gave us some food comp.  T stayed for 3 night and changed hotels every night to have an exciting time.  Well Luxor managed to ruin my experience.  Pay extra and avoid the Luxor.
30,We booked a king room got a confirmation too only to arrive and find out we got 2 queens instead. What good is a booking confirmation? I understand things change but if someone extended their stay how about move them into a 2 queen. No hand soap in the bathroom no fridge no microwave. The digital key doesn’t work 95% of the time due to no cell connection near the elevators. Self parking was a nightmare as well.
50,Staying at the Luxor is a MUST !! From checking in at front desk to gambling staff is friendly engaging & a great experience !!! I ate at their Diablo restaurant & the food was OUTSTANDING enough for leftovers (if you want for midnight snack) !!!
50,We had a enjoyable first time experience staying five nights at the Luxor hotel. Even though it is located at the southern end of the strip it was nice to come back to a more quiet area after touring by day. Also the hotel is connected to Mandalay Bay and the Excalibar which gives you plenty of options without having to go out later in the evening. The staff were professional and friendly always willing to answer any questions you might have. I rate the cleanliness level very high at this property. Staff were always tidying up all areas of the hotel considering the large amount of people that are always passing through. We will definitely consider this property again in the future as well as sister MGM properties.
30,First and last time staying here never again! The quality for the amount you pay is horrible beds suck room are over priced nothing to do in the hotel food sucks parking is ridiculous … self parking $15/daily even if you stay for an hr and $25 for valet! Which is only relevant to me because there is nothing to do in the hotel and you go to other items to enjoy the amenities there which causes you to have leave and pay for parking everyday! The value of the hotel is not what is pay for the staff is not friendly food sucks never again
20,Rooms lacked amenities for a four star hotel. No coffee maker refrigerator microwave or towel racks. The hotel is so large it takes 10 min to go to car. Bad for anyone with mobility issues. Escalators were out which made getting around even more cumbersome.
10,The Hotel itself was showing its age carpet and wall coverings worn and peeling up. Definitely a down-market hotel and not geared toward guest comfort or convenience. The valet was overwhelmed when we arrived and there was no bell service available. The hotel was cold other properties had heat just not this one and it gave the impression the guests of this hotel don’t deserve it or the place is too cheap to run it.    The Tower rooms are quite a walk from check in and feel like they are detached and not really part of the hotel. From the beginning we had issues with elevators the buttons on some elevator’s didn’t work for our floor and the elevator would frequently move before we had time to scan our keycard and choose a floor we were not the only ones. As we walked to our room the hallway wallpaper was flapping in the breeze of a powerful fan kicking up the smell of must and mold only a few feet away from our door.    Our room smelled like cigarettes the furniture was in bad shape worn down banged up and scratched. The room has two TVs but one didn’t work and both had a spaghetti of wires visibly hanging behind and below them. No dressers for your clothes in a suite? No door to the toilet and the toilet was right next to the sinks where spouse is getting ready although the suite bathroom has plenty of room for a door even a pocket door. It also took 5-10 minutes for hot water to reach the shower (huge waste of water in a desert city).    We were in shock to learn there was No Room Service! You were forced to stand in long lines for any kind of food or refreshment. Mandatory use of QR codes requiring you to provide name phone# and email address just to have breakfast. Restaurants (and coffee shops) that were closed at times when they definitely should be open.    The Luxor failed very badly in ways that put a huge damper on our vacation overall. The experience has tainted the MGM brand for sure and will make me second guess Las Vegas as a destination in the future. We were shocked at how down-market this hotel was - absolutely shocked. How I wish we would have read the Yelp reviews before booking. Many of them reflect a similar disappointment as we felt.
50,The staff was friendly attentive and very helpful. This was my first time staying at the hotel and it was a very unique experience. The room was very clean and at arrival I was upgraded for free. The overall vibe was great I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone! Thank you so very much!
50,Have a great day would recommend to anyone there are great dining experiences highly recommend tender which is the steak place or if you just like wings the poor house is great also Gaming was good and room was very nice
10,I hated the long lines delays the shoddy rooms parking fees resort fees and second-class service at this property. My hotel room at the Luxor had no coffee service no clock no microwave and no fridge but the rate was twice as high as hotels who do furnish these amenities. Paying twice as much at Luxor for half the value stinks! On a positive note the elevator service was superb.
40,Very clean property. Loved the theme. Staff was very courteous. Slots treated me well. Enjoyed the buffet for breakfast. We had the BOGO comp for the buffet which made it very affordable. The tram that runs between the three properties was a huge plus!
40,The fridge didn't have drinks elevators went down and the cab service was poor. It was also at the far end of the strip. Not the experience I thought I was paying for. But the tub in the room was nice
10,Elevators are sketch. Rooms lack attention to detail. Parking is $15 per day even after resort fees. Perfect one of the year to go to Vegas!! The weather is not to hot and not to cold. It wasn’t to crowded like it is tin the summer.
50,I loved this hotel. The bed and pillows in my room were the best part of my room. The decor is a little dated but it was clean and very spacious. My only issue was a lack of staff on the casino floor. Guest would leave ashtrays and drinks at the slot machines and I didn’t see any staff going around cleaning in the casino. The hotel part was great.
50,My first time in las Vegas and I had the best time the luxor is an amazing hotel with friendly staff and only a short walk from the strip there is also a tram if you don't want to walk thank you making my time in Vegas one I will never forget hope to be back soon
10,This is the worst hotel I have ever stayed at in Las Vegas. Check in is a 45+ minute wait. Check in electronically but good luck getting into elevators and room with your phone. There is a line at the front desk 24/7. I had to wait 15 minutes for an elevator to my room at 1 am. Casino sucks.2 cashiers working at a time so you wait 15+ minutes to cash out. The electronic ones will not give coins they want you to donate to MGM. They had a fraction of the table games open on a Friday night and just a few during the day. Lines in all the stores. Escalators and walkways to Mandalay Bay and Excalibur broken. Heroin addicts that litter Las Vegas Boulevard wander through the hotel. Any thing outside of the casino area smells like pot. Gone are the days of casinos doing whatever they can to please the customer.
30,Why bother promoting checkin on your app when the app won't work the elevators? I had to wait in a very long checkin line just to get a key in order to use the elevator. Come up with a system that works. Mobile checkin would be great if it worked.
50,When we arrived the bell hop took our bags until our room was ready and we ate at the pyramid cafe best toast i have ever had once our room was ready our bags were brought up to us. best stay ever!!!
50,As far as room rates in Vegas the Luxor was comparable. We stayed in one of the Stay Well rooms in the pyramid tower. The room was nice the bed super comfortable. We were there for an event at the Allegiant Stadium and the Luxor is a short .6 mile walk which made it convenient. It was a quick trip and since we didn't need a car having the stadium that close was a huge reason we picked the Luxor. The staff was friendly helpful professional and caring. Good choice of restaurants on the property and next door at the Mandalay Bay. When we return to Vegas we will likely stay there again.
40,Room was clean and the staff was very friendly. Restaurants were very good also. We enjoyed the variety of restaurants and entertainment. We also enjoyed how easy it was to get to spend time at MGM and Excalibur
50,Clean of rooms was good the people where nice and the only think buffet the food is all not that good for the price. Would think that there will be something different every day but no. Over all it okay.
10,The process of checking in wasn't great but the main issue with this room was the uncleanliness. There was hair on the beds pillows and all over the bathroom. It was clear that no cleaning took place prior to our check-in. Also there were ROACHES. 100% completely unacceptable. Especially during COVID this was very disheartening and I do not recommend.
30,The resort is huge but offers nothing relaxing to do that doesn’t involve spending money- there’s no place to sit and just people watch other than a restaurant or the food court. The room was just ok- mushy mattress/pillows maintenance issues hvac system didn’t work well and bathroom fixtures. Not worth complaining about because Management should know what they have.
40,Room was great. Quiet. Need more variety of tv programming not everyone gambles. Need better climate control in rooms-way too hot for me. Restaurants had great sercice and food was delicious. Would stay again.
50,Excellent and relaxing stay at resort for weekend stay while away from home on business trip. Should have planned stay better and purchased Pro-Bowl tickets. Well hindsight is 20/20. All staff was very professional.
40,The price and room was very nice. The beds were really comfortable. However the elevators were wobbly and wouldn't read our keycards to get to the correct floor. The keycards that were supposed to get us out of the parking structure without having to pay extra wouldn't work either.
40,Not fabulous but comfortable. Convenient to Allegiant Stadium (we attended the Billy Joel Concert). Needed the Pyramid Cafe to be open for dinner and late night. Nice gaming machines. Tram needs to be running earlier.
50,The hotel is very nice with 2 Starbucks & tasty restaurants. The staff was all very nice. The rooms are clean & freshly furnished looking. The spa&salon was my favorite part so welcoming comfortable & relaxing.
50,I enjoyed the experience. The people were friendly. They were helpful and patient with me. The room was comfortable. I just wish the hot tub had the jets in it to help soothe my body a little more. It was one of the best experiences that I’ve had in a hotel in a while.
50,My first visit to Las Vegas! My nephew recommended this resort and he was spot on! Great price great sleep! Beautiful theming throughout! Loved the tram between Excalibur and Mandalay Bay saved some walking!!
40,We flew in to attend a concert at Allegiant Field and the Luxor was the perfect location to stay. (A short walking distance).  Comfortable and clean rooms. Friendly staff. Convenient food venues and convenient gift shops for all those quick snacks. Close to the airport.
40,Was a fun trip the front desk was very accommodating. We wanted to check in early and was given several options in order to do so which was nice. The room did smell like cigarette smoke and the shower only has a half of a glass wall to enclose it which does not keep the water in the shower. Other wise it was a great trip
30,Stayed here for a concert at Allegiant Stadium next door. Convenient walking distance however our bed was very uncomfortable no blanket and lumpy bed. Sheets had some nasty brown stains. Overall the hotel was kind of dirty.
40,Housekeeping was great. Check in was hectic. Electronic key did not work on elevators you had to get a physical card. Food court was not great but DeAblos was amazing. Shower didn’t have 2 doors so water got everywhere
10,Everything was dirty it was impossible to get in touch with the customer service!!! Asked for tooth brushes and sleepers got them in more than 20 minutes. I will never stay at luxor again EVER. You guys don’t care about ur customers
40,I drove to the Luxor from Utah to attend shows and the Super Bowl viewing party. Check in was fast and I got the room I requested. (Thanks to Ott Ashton my Casino Host). I attended AGT and Fantasy Shows in the hotel and then the Party in the Egyptian Ballroom. Food and drink included!! Was a good fun game.
40,i was disappointed in the steakhouse. It was over $200 for my wife and I but it seemed ordinary and not special. The waitstaff was casual and the furnishings were dated. Everything else was great. Thanks
50,Love Vegas went for my 60th birthday will stay at New York New York next time closer to the arena and other hotels Luxor was nice but I think I want to be closer to the center I love the steak restaurant in Luxor
40,First time experience staying at the Luxor which was very positive. Room was very nicely laid out and comfortable. All the staff is incredibly helpful and friendly. Nice variety of dining choices between a small food court and sit down restaurants. In summer time the pool area would be fantastic unfortunately it was still too cool to be open yet. Great spot to stay for solo friends or families.
40,Stayed a couple days - Room 1028. If you like a quiet room that is close to the action this is great. We loved being to close to a small diner - great for morning coffee. The only negative experience was the bathroom fan was loud and didn't work - not enough for us to ask for another room though. Prepay parking worked fairly well only had a few issues with the scanner reading. LOVED mobile checkin keys & checkout.
50,The hotel is amazing. So much to do and see. Everyone was so friendly polite & helpful. I would stay at the Luxor again. The food was great no matter where we went. Would recommend this place for sure.
40,staff friendly and so much to do. We were greeted with smiles and everyone was very willing to help out. The only negative was food prices but i know that's part of being in vegas. I only wish we could have stayed longer
50,Not very accommodating or even hospitable. Opted out of room service prior to check in and yet was rudely awaken at 11am pounding and opening my door Monday and was very irritated after traveling all night and then again Tuesday afternoon housekeeping gentleman at door when I replied I opted out of service and didn’t need his services with attitude “are uou sure ??” Yes and already had someone come had to just shut door lingered . And this time frustrated me more being disturbed yet again when had laid down to rest in afternoon as this was my vacation and especially since just encountered services day before unwanted . What’s the pint of despite dictating my preferences and wishes it was ignored.
50,The front desk staff were so helpful in attending our needs. I would say very professional. The rooms where we stayed were so clean the view at the 10th floor was panoramic overlooking the Las Vegas Boulevard beautiful sunrise. We stayed for three days and it was fun while it lasted. It’s not our first time in your hotel. I like the pyramid. Hoping to be back soon!
50,Honestly great time it’s a one of a kind experience and offers great price too! Just be aware if you’re scared of heights it’ll really get you there’s no railings! Overall great room nice beds and sheets bathroom was very very nice and provided practically everything.
40,10 if they clean up the transient problem. We loved the updated room. Using the MGM app for check in and parking pat is brilliant. I never had to see anyone. It was so easy. The cleaning service was excellent.
50,Everything was awesome except we didn’t have a refrigerator in the room. I love the way the escalator were. The stores in the lobby were very convenient . Service was very helpful actually. And when we asked for more towels we got them almost within 10 . I’m happy . I’ll definitely come back
50,Went to a Geroge Straight Concert it was great Slots were crappy as usual room was great weather was great. slots were crappy Oh did I mention the Slots were Crappy. parking lot is a nightmare plus its $15.00 a night Bad enough to pay high prices for rooms but to pay to park also think Ill be staying back out to the Silverton from now on. Did I mention the slots were crappy?
50,Beautiful casino. Great people. First time there and fell in love with it. Location was great. The restaurant’s had amazing food and great service. We were close to other favorite places like T mobile. We could walk to other casinos or take the tram that was so convenient. You also didn’t need to wait forever for a limousine or Uber ride.
50,The luxor is one of the older properties for mgm. Last time we stayed there I wasn’t very impressed. However fast forward 2-3 years rooms have been upgraded and the new hyperx areana was great. As A gamer I can’t imagine staying anywhere else.
40,Great Hotel to look at. Tower room is a far walk. Key on phone app didn’t work so we had to get keys made. I recommend that before you head up. Room was nice just needs more color. We wish we had a view room.
50,Great value. Clean rooms helpful staff and a great location in the strip. Great exhibits for couples and families alike. Restaurants are great and wide ranging in cuisines and price ranges. My 10 year old gamer son loves the Hyper X experience. Will definitely be staying again in the near future
50,We stayed here to celebrate my son's 23rd birthday. We got him his own room because the price was so affordable. This hotel is beautiful has clean and spacious rooms and excellent entertainment options all on site. We will definitely be back!
40,I had an excellent time at Luxor. I only saw one show but it was special. Fantasy was so much fun. I had a great time for the hour twenty minute show. My one bedroom suite was also special. The room was so nice and quiet with two tvs. I had a great time at Luxor and I hit a jackpot on wheel of fortune.
40,Nice suite room. Good food. Close to all the casinos we like to play at. Close to off the strip casino we play at. We also rented a car from the casino. Very easy to do. Easy walk to hockey stadium.
50,Had an excellent time at the hotel clean and staff is great!! Close to the strip restaurants and shopping malls. Finding transportation going back and forth was easy. I would recommend this hotel and will definitely be back soon.
50,Very nice clean hotel/casino friendly staff great for a first time visit like ours budget friendly quality food lots of games to pick from and enjoy close to most things on the strip great walkability
40,Wife and I got a soaking tub suite at the Luxor in February. Price was fair and room was clean and comfortable. Staff seemed a little scared to talk at first almost like they had been abused by other guests but warmed up and became very friendly when they realized we weren’t going to complain about things. Casino floor staff were fun and professional. Had dinner at the Tender steakhouse and it was amazing! Didn’t have a reservation on a Saturday night but the hostess made room for us anyway. Also had dinner the following day at Diablos and the food and staff were both out of this world. Highly recommend this place for a nice getaway.
30,Overall the Luxor is tired & worn. Very few choices for casual sit down eatery....Our 1 bedroom Tower suite tho very lovely & spacious was an 8 minute walk dragging heavy luggage. I requested a room near the elevators & we were as far away as possible ! Had to wait 20-25 minutes for a cab to the airport .
10,The check in was not bad it was the room. First of all the carpet was dirty and smelled like mold and smoke. We found black mold in the AC vent and when we called for a room change we were disconnected and transferred to unmanned numbers. None of the furniture was dusted and there was dust everywhere we thought Excalibur had sunken to low levels MGM this does not represent you well.
50,We came for our anniversary and the staff was nice and helpful. The room was clean and nicely played out. Honestly for the price it's very good. Is it new. No. But considering everything we were very happy.
20,2.5 would probably be a fairer score as nothing particularly bad happened during our stay. But it’s hard to call the Luxor “average” given all the other hotels only a short distance away.    The Luxor is a PYRAMID for goodness sake and still manages to lack any character grandeur or “wow factor” once inside. It seems that MGM have neglected this property in favour of others on the strip.    The vibe is dark and dingy in the main areas the amenities severely limited - a food court of 4 fast food places and a couple of very overpriced restaurants along with a star bucks is all you can expect with 2 extremely overpriced “essentials” stores. ($6.49 for a Gatorade!).    We stayed in one of the more recently refurbed premium rooms and it was ok lighter and more airy than the communal areas of the hotel comfortable bed and good shower but still fairly old scratched and damaged furniture and little to no amenities - no fridge safe was broken. The towels were also incredibly incredibly small…    As mentioned in another review the smell of weed was evident on multiple days throughout the hotel and especially on the landings/corridors outside of the rooms. You’re also only meant to be able to access the floor your room is on for safety purposes but we had takeout menus slipped under our door so someone was able to get around this.    In general there felt to be a lack of staff at the Luxor compared to other hotels we passed through. I outwardly noticed security’s presence only a few times during our stay but would notice them constantly in other hotels we passed through.    The Luxor seems to exist as almost a pass through between the Mandalay which has a better vibe and is less run down and the Excalibur which isn’t much better than the Luxor but had more restaurants and shops.    If we came back to vegas we would stay further up the strip for both location and experience - the Luxor is a 15/20 minute walk to where the strip really starts in earnest and the same to the nearest walgreens/CVS to avoid paying $6 for a drink.    If you stay at the luxor you’ll regret having done so when you walk into nearly every other hotel/casino on the strip we did.    It just doesn’t have that”vegas” feel to it nowadays where I’m sure it once did. It needs some investment to bring it up to the level of the competing hotels.    Resort fee which is unavoidable unless a high tier rewards member was $39.68 per room per night inclusive of tax during our stay at the end of Feb 2022.
30,The good: the room was clean and the bathroom was very nice. The bad: the carpet looked like it needed updated no fridge in the room and the windows were dirty on the outside. Check in and out was very convenient with the app.
30,Room wasn’t cleaned all the way. Left over food wrappers and an empty lotion container in the bathRoom. Crumbs on the floor and lotion on the little personal desk in the corner. Other than that it’s a super cool place! Loved the inside and the elevators throw you for a loop!
20,This was supposed to be a girls getaway but stepping into the hotel you’re greeted by aggressive salespeople and the stench of something rotten. The room was basic but I’ve heard that other resorts are better and would say it’s worth to spend the money elsewhere than staying here. Also the shower has no curtain so every time you bathe water gets everywhere in the bathroom which is annoying when you’re sharing a room.
50,Luxor is amazing inside and out. Strongly recommend! The scenery is so cool and easy access to the strip and other hotels. Prices were super affordable and the rooms are clean. Make sure to get a Luxor to go drink and enjoy!
30,Cool place but badly in need of renovation. Also didn't like being hassled about time shares. Location was prime staff was friendly enough though never saw anyone at the concierge desk. The phone also had buttons switched which was not helpful.
40,Great value for the price. Went for a weekend getaway. Checkin was a bit long but you can do mobile checkin which i dont do. Alot of people with their pets(not service animal) i do not care for this. Not a bad stay
50,Have stayed here numerous times always a pleasure. They always have taken great care in making our stay the best we could have. Nice staff awesome clean rooms and a great choice in a variety of different foods both there and nearby.
30,Although the room was clean and spacious the rest of the hotel is a little dingy and dirty. Wallpaper was ripped there were huge chips in the paint and the carpet was dirty. The overall experience was just ok. Not too bad but not great.
20,Not recommended to stay staff are rude rooms not very clean only starbugs to get coffee flight and hotel package expesive with very little emenities. Room view was of the the cross walk at the tower.
50,It’s a good place to stay and have some fun with your friends and family and we will be back really soon for a few days again and we will have more people with us next timeso see you soon and thanks for letting us stay safe at the hotel.
20,When I arrived my credit card was charged more than $400 more than my confirmation recipient stated. The manager was argumentative and did not want to honor the amount on my confirmation. After I got into an argument with the manager who was very rude they took off some of my resort fees. I ended up paying more than the amount that was on my confirmation. To make matters worst when I went to my room I was horrified to see it was already occupied by another guest. I had to be assigned another room which was on the other side of the hotel. I was isolated from the other members of my party who I came to the hotel with. They ruined my 4 day vacation.
50,I really enjoyed the beds they were comfortable. The only thing I wish our rooms had is a refrigerator as I had to throw away my extra food. The rooms were clean. The restaurants in the hotel were good. Enjoyed the blue man group.
20,Elevators are horrible! Keys didn't work the whole stay. No restaurants were open Didn't have towels. Asked for towels and didn't get any until next day. We never received a scan code for self check in. Won't stay there again. And that used to be my FAVORITE hotel.
30,Fantastic Interior! Nice Casino. Good food Court.  The connection to the “inner strip” through the high line is pretty convenient.  Sadly our shower didn’t work properly and the room service didn’t do our room even though we tipped the lady beforehand.  Overall a nice place to stay.
50,3 nights free and a great meal and drinks. came for the slot tournament and had a great time. the food and drinks at the diable bar was great and they made my drink just the way that I like it even though it wasn't on the menu.
10,Do not stay here no matter how cheap it is do yourself a favor and stay somewhere else! It's run down gross elevators are broken rooms smell like body odor. It smells like people are smoking weed everywhere in the hotel/casino. It's just disgusting.
10,I was not impressed with this hotel. It’s definitely old and outdated. It was a maze trying to find the room and when we did find it it was dark and dirty. The tile in the bathroom was broken and moldy !! Do not recommend
20,Really expected more of the little things. Cheched in online at 2pm was at the hotel by 2:30 and the room wasn't ready. Check is wasn't until 3pm so it wasn't a big deal. The desk said they would expedite the room so we waited in the bar. Hotel smelled like cigarettes everywhere. At 3:30 still no room same at 4 and 4:30 so much for expediting. Manager stated he would give us a $100 food and beverage credit for being patient. Room was finally ready just after 5pm. The room was old and needed care. Furniture was damaged no robes no conditioner. I really expected more. Had to ask for the credit the next day as it hadn't been added to our account. Food was average at best. I will find somewhere else to stay next time.
20,Multiple employees were not knowledgeable of how to get to the self parking; the front desk only had one employee working around 8pm despite there being a growing line of customers; an employee with a walkie talkie was outside our room at 3am for about 20 minutes with the walkie talkie being very loud and waking us up; beds were very uncomfortable; mobile app digital key is useless having only ever worked one time.
10,It took us 3 times to the front desk to get a room (the electronic sign in did not work). The beds were cloud like and very low. Getting out of bed was difficult.    The place was dirty... someone dropped a deodorant lid on the floor of one of the elevators it was there for at least 24 hours.    The elevators were problematic one felt like a bucking bronco another had no lights in it and yet a third chose what floor you went to regardless of the button pushed.
50,The hotel was clean. Every staff member was very friendly. The location was good. The food was great! Mobile check in was very easy. Talked with many staff member in various departments and all were exceptionally nice. They must treat their workers well. They seem to enjoy their jobs and they do them well.
40,Luxor was great! It’s nice to see things opening back up. There were a couple of shops not open but it feels like things are getting back to normal.  The staff was friendly and the hotel was clean. I think the mgm app has room for improvement.
40,The room was clean and well put together if you stay in the towers instead of the pyramid . Valet was amazing just be sure to read the rules of how the charging works! If you have kids bring them here they have a Hyper X area a which is like a gaming space for any ages . I use to come here when I was a kid and this was during the arcade times! Not many places have arcades or gaming for kids . So I would recommend that if you are a family! Parking is ok! The parking behind Luxor can be better lit up with lights and better experience for walking! So if you can when it comes to dropping off! Or checking out I would recommend the guest drop off so everyone has their luggage with them instead of walking with everything . One Starbucks is opened 24 hours which is nice but order ahead on mobile gets busy. I didn’t check out the food court . Did notice a bar that had life music so if you wanna chill with a few drinks and some music it seemed good. Besides that overall Luxor is a good choice and safe choice
30,We were missing a fridge the sink and toilet clogged and the shower did not have a door or a curtain to keep water off the floor outside the shower. We resolved a lot ourselves but it was what we needed for the Metallica and Greta Van Fleet concert
30,Check in line was very very long. Wait time was the longest that I have every experienced at any hotel. I paid for early check in and my room still wasn't ready until after 3 p.m. I was told that I would get a call when it was ready. We had to go back and wait in the line again to find out that it was finally ready. Room wasn't very clean. None of the restaurants in the hotel delivered to the room. Aside from the person that checked us in the rest of the staff seemed very pleasant. We stayed in a corner king suite and the wind noise was so loud that my girlfriend could not sleep.
30,For the money we paid I would expect a better room. The room was very dated with no many fridge and the TV system was a joke. The hot water only lasted about three minutes. We’ve stayed there twice in the last five years and both times of the fire alarm went off around 3 AM and Kept us up all night.
40,Overall facility was a good value. Great staff a relaxed environment with some interesting attractions. The food court could use more options to keep from venturing to other casinos. The only disappointment was the pool facilities were closed during our stay. The one option my daughter looked forward to after a long weekend of soccer.
30,The location is great. I would prefer more food options during the day without having to leave the casino. However there's better food options at the adjacent hotels which isn't difficult to get to. Adding one more crap table would be nice.
40,Finding your room will definitely be difficult the first few days. The hotel is too beautiful to not have any access to a microwave. But overall it was very clean staff are friendly and if you need anything from the front desk or house keeping.... before you hang up the phone they are there!.
50,Great staff very friendly and helpful clean rooms and very comfortable beds. Highly recommended. Close to Mandalay Bay and Excalibur and a stone throw away from MGM and New York New York. Would highly recommend
10,I stay 2 nights my room was old and worn out the alarm went off at 3:18 in the morning will kill everybody up in the hotel service was horrible waited in line for everything never had any maid service for the two nights I was there.
30,Whatever room rate they quoted you you need to add an additional $35 in Resort Fees even when the resort amenities such as the pool and hot tub are closed for the season. The hotel is nice overall but certainly nothing spectacular.
30,No refrigerator for left overs. (Food and drink are expensive here and there’s no way to store leftovers… very wasteful)    The vents only cool one tiny part of the room. Not great circulation of air at all.    Shower pressure is good but be careful - there’s no curtain or full door so you may get the floor pretty wet when showering.    Elevators are shaky and kinda scary but to be expected when in a pyramid shaped hotel… lol    Didn’t encounter hotel staff too often but the people at the spa are great and would definitely recommend a massage there!
40,Rooms decent. Need microwaves though. Like that Luxor connected to Mandalay hotel. Lots of things to do in Luxor. Right on strip everything was pretty close if you wanted to go out walking. I would stay again
40,Luxor is a very unique structure. There really is no other building like it. Not in the western United States anyway. Unless you count the Rosicrucian Museum in Santa Clara CA. The room was spotless and I had a great view of the pool. I wish they had more dining options but Diablo’s is really great. It needs a bit of a facelift but it’s still very beautiful.
50,I came to The Luxor because it was across the street from Allegiant Stadium where I was to see Metallica perform. The Luxor staff was exceptional in helping me at check-in after a mixup when booking. The Titanic and Bodies exhibits were so incredibly fun - I will definitely go back.
10,Alarm went off at 3am in the entire building. Moldy musty room. No coffee maker TV didn't work no fridge.    Worst hotel I've stayed in in a LONG time. Terrible parking when events are there. Would never go back or recommend.
30,Room was spacious and housekeeping provided great service. Our car was broken into in the self parking lot for the Luxor so it was good that we didn’t leave anything valuable in our car. The car was parked right under a security camera but that didn’t deter the thief. Since they charge daily for parking it was obvious the $15 per day fee did not cover parking lot security. All in all we had a great experience just as a warning do not leave anything that you don’t want stolen in your car.
20,For the price I thought the rooms would be more updated and clean but was dissatisfied when I saw the conditions. Not worth the price. Cleanliness was also an issue N  and nothing was done by staff to accommodate our needs. Guests were being so loud next to us but si ce nothing was done about other issues I didn’t even bother.
50,Very nice clean rooms. Staff very friendly. Need anything at all and any one of the workers are more than happy to help. Show AGT was fantastic! Would recommend anyone that is looking for a great place to stay and play should try it for yourself! You will not be sorry.
10,This has been the WORST experience at the Luxor. We stayed here to be walking distance from the Billy Joel concert but what a mistake to stay here. We got here at 4:48 pm checked in via the app only to find our room wasn’t ready even though check in was at 3pm. Had to carry around our bags around the casino for 20 minutes and then I was notified our room was ready. We go to our room only to find out it wasn’t a king bed like I had paid for it was a queen. I called and complained. They moved me to a king room. Great! But when we get back at 11pm from the concert we are literally sharing a wall with a lounge that’s having a rave until 3am. I call and complain. She says she will refund me the $39 resort fee and she has no other room for us. REALLY? I still have to pay $300 for a room I can’t sleep in??? I tell her my husband is a firefighter and literally was up the entire night before on duty and there is no way we can sleep with the rave on the other side of the wall. Magically she found us another room with a queen bed… we come to the room tired ready for a shower and bed just to find there no soap at all in this room. We have called and requested soap and still are waiting… WORST EXPERIENCE EVER!
40,The stay was affordable and there is everything all inside from restaurants to things to do. The overall cleanliness of the building was nice. The idea of a pyramid was very cool. Lots of things including restaurants and shopping
20,Room had bare minimum. Only 3 pillows on king size bed for 2 people. No mini fridge. Only had 1/2 shower door. Water gets all over floor. Shower had very slow drain was standing in pool of water. Sink had very slow drain. Multiple key card readers on elevators do not work.
20,Hotel is outdated across the board. Room was clean but the walls are paper thin. I could hear every conversation next to me and they weren't being loud. Mattress was okay did have trouble falling  and staying asleep. There wasn't a mini fridge or a microwave. Elevators felt like they could crash at any moment. The room key requirement to select a floor was beyond frustrating. They kept failing and it would happen to multiple people's keys. The casino was sub par compared to other hotels on the strip. Restaurants are okay but more are needed.
20,The rooms looked old and tired definitely in need of upgrading. Half the restaurants were closed and what ones were open had limited hours. The price of everything is absolutely outrageous esp. food
50,the luxor is an excellent destination in las vegas --clean and well priced with an outstanding buffet --easy walking distance to numerous other casinos will definitely go back-staff was excellent and very friendly
20,The digital & physical keys were awful & wouldn’t work consistently for the room or elevator. It was a major hassle. The room was so-so but definitely not worth the rate. $35 resort fee pool closed. Felt run down. Slow wifi. Close walk to stadium.
50,We stayed here last night to attend a convention and it was super aweful stay that we ended up staying awake the whole night and had to leave early morning. The bed is very uncomfortable sucks in short. We can hear people talkin and walking so this adds to us waking up when we barely got the sleep. In addition we can hear the cars and planes and the aircondition automatically shuts off every 30-45 min. Plus there’s no fridge in the room. They had to bring one and charge us $25 for that. Amazing huh! We called the front desk and the lady was kind of rude. We got a call from the manager at 5ish am and she ended up giving us a 40% for the sleepless night and we have to check out today. That discount isnt even worth it for the inconvenience we suffered. Oh well we will never go back to this hotel ever! We should have read all the bad reviews here before even considering of staying here. It’s a bad decision.
30,Great pricing on the room but after seeing dated decor having a room with electrical plugs that didn't work and covers off and cracked and frayed coverings on the handrails and elevators I would not stay here again. I would consider other MGM properties but not the Luxor.
50,Great customer service and friendly staff as well. Small issue regarding the room that was reserved but was quickly resolved. Staff at the buffet were really friendly helpful and the food was good with lots of choices
30,Don't spend a lot to stay here. Some venues are not open during the week. Elevators have broken items and spilled food/trash in them. Rooms are good if you get a good price. Staff is friendly. Bar drinks are pricey.
20,I know this resort is much cheaper than others but having stayed for 5 nights in a ‘premium’ room it’s worth it to spend the extra money and stay elsewhere. The hotel is practically falling apart. It was fine for what we paid but we will not be back.
40,Given that this is one of the older casinos it was still a blast to stay at. It was my wifes first time in Vegas and we ended up doing almost everything here. We didn't visit any of the other casinos because of the awesome time we were having. The only issue issue was the elevators in the Pyramid were slow and didn't read the access cards very well
20,Room wasn’t clean upon arrival shower is old and outdated and it shows. Doesn’t look clean. No microwave or refrigerator in room. Hotel employees are rude including the ones at the restaurants. I work in service as a Nurse and even when I’m having a bad day no one at work will no and I definitely will not be reuse to my patients. The location of room was ridiculously long from the elevator. Had to continue to ask for more bath towels even when they cleaned the room and noticed the towels were used. In the casino had to wait over hour for a drink. The waitresses were rude. I’ve been to Vegas several times and this was one of the worst hotels.
30,Our stay was not too bad the room was definitely an upgrade from the hotel we had been at for the 2 days prior. The room was roomy and clean although the bathroom could have used an update because paint was bubbling on the top of the wall. The pool was nice and very clean. The issue I did have was the pool closed early one day and was not open another day. That was disappointing. The food court was just okay and the restaurants were lacking. Next time we will stay closer to thr strip.
30,We found the rooms to be clean but no fridge coffee pot or even a alarm clock are in the rooms.  Food is exceptionally expensive in the casino.  Food average at best.  2 salads with grilled chicken $50
10,The rooms are very bad. The room was relatively clean however there were stains in the bathroom. The furniture is very worn and dated. Would not recommend. I love MGM and they are a class act. I can't believe MGM keeps this property in the inventory.
10,Check-in took 2 hours and no one apologized or did anything to make things better. The MGM app did not work. Room smelled weird. Hotel was dark and dated. Elevators took forever to arrive to the floors and lobby.
30,The tv in our room didn’t work the mattress is hard and uncomfortable. The wifi is horrible and keeps cutting out. Someone tried to break into our car in the parking lot they claim they have security walking it but in the six nights we were there I never saw anyone. For $15 a night parking you would think they could afford to have a person or two around. When you need to call the front desk there is a 20 minute wait to speak to someone and if you go down to the desk the line is forever long.
50,Staff is great in every area. Always willing to help you if needed. Food is great the Pyramid cafe is excellent place for breakfast and lunch. Tender steakhouse has unbelievable steaks! Waiters are great! They were able to check us into our room early since our flight was early coming in rooms were excellent cleaning people did a great job also.
40,Great atmosphere especially if you’re into Egyptian lore…. Friendly staff awesome rooms… Food is pricey but good quality.. Casino was clean wasn’t smokey at all. Great location and easy access to adjoining resorts.
20,Smell like grease from the restaurants and cigarette smoke almost everywhere throughout the hotel; even nonsmoking rooms smell musty (not fresh);no mini fridge in the room; AC system not working properly; dingy elevators; only ONE healthy food place in the entire hotel (bad customer service)
10,This hotel is not worth the price they charge. It’s old and run down. They don’t offer the normal room amenities (refrigerator and microwave). Not enough towels to accommodate the three people in our room. The whole time on the phone to get anything needed was observed.
10,"I had a ""Fresh"" room and it was anything but fresh. Housekeeping was non-existent lighting was poor AND missing bulbs there was something FLOATING in the Vit C Shower Infuser the fan vent was caked in dust/dirt and the elevators were poorly maintained!"
30,Ancient ass rooms! They need a major upgrade Luxor makes to much money for there rooms to be that lame. I was very disappointed! The steak house has the best Ribeye you'll ever eat In your life that's the only thing and the casino floor is cool but them rooms are garbage!
30,1st trip to Vegas and we had wanted to stay at the hotel due to its uniqueness. We were shocked to discover that smoking is still allowed in casinos apparently there is only supposed to be smoking in the casino area only. People were smoking all over the hotel no-one doing anything about it. Check in was very long with hardly any staff on numerous checkin in desks it's not hard to sort out the small stuff like this! We had 2 guys behind using vapes and blowing it all over us not great or covid friendly. The restaurants are all open so they get smoky too there is supposed to be some kind of clean air system - guys it's not working! We spent a lot of time at the park mgm which 😊 is smoke free. We were on the 29th floor found the lifts quite interesting the room was good size and very clean and beds super comfy. Only problem was we kept getting a smell of pot in the room but couldn't suss out where it was coming from. I would have given the hotel 4 stars but not with the smoking. I feel sorry for the staff to have to work in there we all know it's not good for you but money talks.
20,No refrigerators no microwaves Plus overcharging for food and alcohol is really f****** ridiculous I mean come on 2 hot dogs that were uncook Half of a chicken cheess steak And 2 blue moons shouldn't cost me 64 bucks.......
10,Worst stay ever! Everything was closed. My room and towels had hair all over them; one had used makeup on it. Then there was crap in the toilet still. There isn’t a shower door so the bathroom was wet the entire time. The air broke so no air just stagnet discomfort. One staff member would offer to help send another member who didn’t care and was unaware of the agreement. Spent the majority of my only vacation fighting with staff and moving rooms.
50,This was my first time in Vegas and the Luxor did not disappoint. Would definitely stay there again if I return to Vegas. Room was clean and staff was friendly. If you’re going to use the mobile app be prepared to visit the front desk a few times as it seems it’s still a work in progress.
50,Had a great time over President’s Day weekend. Used virtual check in for room assignment and for room keys. Did have to wait in mile long checkin line! Would stay here again riding elevator was always an interesting experience
10,Sink full of pubic hair broken ac previous guests old fast food remnants in a “clean” room. Blatant lies from the manager Chris and a three hour three room check in process has left me never wanting to visit a MGM property again.
20,cleanliness and customer service shortage. need customer service at the mobile check-in to guide people and help a customer who might have mobile online issues. Frontdesk calls are never answered within 10 minutes it took me 25 minutes the second time i called frontdesk to get a live person.
20,30 minutes to buy a coffee at starbucks they wouldnt let me check out an hour late. Maid doesnt even knock just lets herself in. Made me wait till close to 3pm to check in wouldnt give me reciept at checkout unless i wait 20+ minutes. I wont be back too many other places to play and stay.
10,Hotel recommends using keyless by asking guest to use cell phone as their key while staying at the hotel. After 11pm according to staff members app is shut down for maintenance which causes long lines at the check in registration.
20,I have emailed guest services with all of the bad experiences at the Luxor. Starting with the check in process and many other problems in between and ending it with the exit of the Hotel not allowing us key cards not working well.
10,The security needs to be beefed up tons of crime and at night lots of shady riff raft    Not a safe casino anymore    Probably stay someplace else    Elevators barely work and elevators 4b the panel comes off the wall    Badly in need of maintenance
50,Rolled in at 3am as part of a longer trip in to Wyoming to a large clean room. Comfortable hairless bed provided a peaceful sleep. Have stayed at Luxor before when staying in Vegas and they have certainly upgraded rooms. Will certainly stay again.
50,My Boyfriend and I come here frequently. We had recently taken my family at the end of 2021 and came back just us two in Feb. Great location and choices of things to go do and also games to play on the casino floor.
20,Check in line is terribly long rooms lack water and coffee bathrooms do not have ventilation fans elevators key card readers do not work reliably. Televisions do not allow you to log into streaming services.
50,The Luxor was at great hotel/casino to stay at as well as game in. The casino had fun games and the dealers were super friendly and nice! The roulette dealers Steve Ed JR and Rodrigo made our experience worth while! Whether we won or lost those dealers made our trip fun and exciting!
10,Rooms smelled musty. Our room was so loud from outside noise that it was next to impossible to sleep.  Bell service wasn't happy with a $5 tip when I did most the work myself. I wanted my bags because I needed them immediately.
10,Booked through the app which was a breeze. I booked for a double Queen room. When I received my confirmation on the app I was put in a king nope not gonna work for three people. So I called where I was given the run around for 45 mins. Being put on hold and transferred. Anyway as I was in the phone explaining that I booked two weeks prior so I don’t understand why I was being given the incorrect room. The rep “Arlie” put me on hold AGAIN then failed to click the line over fast enough and myself and my 2 children I was traveling with heard her tell me to shut the “f” up. Not to mention the room was filthy especially the bathroom. No fridge. It was just not a good experience.
50,Excellent all around the board  Great service  Great location  Excellent room service  Excellent cleaning room service  Excellent security  I would definitely recommend my friends and family to stay here every time they come here
20,It was extremely difficult to contact front desk/concierge and there was a general lack of knowledge from hotel staff about room functionality (i.e. AC availability). The bathroom fan was broken as well as the drain being super clogged. On top of it all even the iron in the room was broken. It was our first trip to Vegas and we were very excited about staying in this hotel but it was a pretty severe letdown aside from the price.
30,Luxor was once quite a place but is older now. Rates were pretty good and I did like the proximity and access to Mandalay Bay. No complaints but would like something a little newer. As it was winter we didn’t try the pool.
20,"I was born in Vegas my family has worked in various hotels for years and years - and I am so disappointed in how my recent trip to the Luxor went. My husband and I were asked to listen to a time-share presentation 6 times in a 3 day stay - to the point where we simply never returned to the main atrium. Twice we got harassed after asking for directions to another part of the hotel.  If somebody says ""ARE YOU STAYING HERE FOR A FEW DAYS?"" just walk away. They will pull you into long drawn out explanation about the things they will ""give"" you in exchange for your time. One lady chased us down the hall while continuing on her sales pitch as we tried to walk away. It's incredible.    In other news our room walls were paper thin - to the point where we heard every single sound from the neighboring room. We also smelled every single smell. Anytime one of them used the restroom we got to smell the stench in our room for an hour until the AC pushed it around enough. I wouldn't recommend the Luxor ever - over the other places in a better location in the middle of the strip."
30,Stay in tower. Much nicer rooms. Less noise and smoke. Double check your bill over charged for things that were promised to come off bill and didn’t. Wait staff was super kind and efficient. Bar staff too.
40,The staff was exceptionally kind and helpful. Our rooms were suites on the pyramid floors and very beautiful with a large jet tub in the room and a separate room with couch table and television. Very clean! The bathrooms were spacious. The only thing I didn't care for was the shower only had a half glass wall instead of a door. Water would find its way out onto the floor...not a big deal just used extra towels to keep the floor dry.
20,Bruce at the bar was great but I requested a blanket and the staff delivered an unclean and hair covered one in still grossed out thinking back to that. Secondly the shower title wasn’t cleaned it had stains that I managed to clean with a sponge and some elbow grease. I’m gonna try the Mandalay Bay and hope for a better result next time
20,It was a clean room but there are no in room amenities.. no coffee maker no refrigerator no hotel brochures and a crazy design flaw of only 1/2 a shower door. This allows the bathroom floor to all wet. And there is no security lock on the outside door.
40,Great place to stay friendly clean. Walkable to some other great locations. Still trying to figure out what you get for the $35 resort fee. My son and I come yearly to Vegas. Luxor is one of our favorites to stay.
10,Will attempt fraud charges to boost their revenue. Jack was terrible and should be fired. Resort fees are also a straight scam but that’s another story thats unrelated. Got charged a bogus cleaning fee of 350 dollars for a dog that was in the room for 5 minutes while we retrieved our luggage
10,I book a doble bed for my wife and two kids and when I arrived they was sold out so I get a single bed room they don’t have a roll over bed’s so I sleep on the floor because my reservation was a prepaid and cancel was an option I arrived at midnight so was a nightmare
40,The main reason we chose the room was for the bathtub. We enjoyed relaxing together and the overall stay was great. I hope you bring back the lunch/dinner buffet for the nights you want a quick bite. Would stay again.
30,Check in customer service was lacking. They acted as if they could not be bothered. One even rudely stated I'd have it would have been quicker to do so completely online. The valet attendant was amazing. He appeared to love his job took his time talking to us. Just a great person.
20,This place was far from impressive the room smelled like smoke and the entire floor had a stench to it. Casino was less than impressive lighting and overall felt like dwelling in a cave. Diablo's Cantina was the only part of the entire experience we enjoyed. Other guests were reporting room/guest troubles as we stood in line forever waiting on service. This place needs a facelift for sure.
30,I upgrade to a suite the two ac units was no really working the bath tub had a bad black stain called the front desk they don't care. I will never stay there again a waste of money. Also the room had a bad odor.....
20,Family trip for volleyball tournament. Very underwhelming experience when compared to other vegas hotels. Lengthy check in experience no refrigerator old and musty room. Just not a great Vegas experience.
40,The room was very clean as were the sheets and towels. We called down for extra pillows and never received them. The room was austere and plain with no soap dish  one wastebasket no bedspreads and nothing on the walls.
30,If you come to this hotel: bring cash for tips memorize your elevator number plan for 50 minute lines at Starbucks in the hotel budget $35 per person for meals. Staff was super friendly. Careful of hidden fees.
30,Shower was not the best which caused some minor flooding in the bathroom because of the half door and elevator is in poor condition. Buttons need to be replaced and elevator door frames are falling apart.
50,I loved the beautiful statues. The rooms were very clean as well….the staff was nice………………………………………I would definitely recommend………………………………………………………………………………..Go stay with Luxor!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
30,lobby and hallways to room are very dark. Need better lighting. Room was clean but hallway was dirty looking. Bathroom shower had no door just a half wall. no matter how you adjusted the shower head water went all over the floor. Water pressure was great.
30,Please make sure you have the internet you need during your stay and the blankets are poor quality. unhappy customer service. rooms are not clean and the elevators some are not work property special 2B
40,We recently received a 3-day comped stay at the Luxor. We checked-in on a Wednesday around 7:00 p.m. There was no wait and the experience was quick and pleasant. Our room was in the pyramid and was comfortable quiet and updated (based on our recollection of a previous stay 20 years previous to this one!). The only drawback is that the room is a very long walk from the self-parking area and there is a $15 daily self-parking fee. Otherwise I would highly recommend the Luxor!
40,Very Neat Place. The hotel is massive. Check in was quick and easy. Rooms were comfortable and clean Housekeeping was very good Public areas were well cared for and clean The Americas Got Talent show was very good . Lots of Restaurants I’m the hotel as well as more offerings in Mandalay Bay and Excalibur both attached to the Luxor. Self parking was easily accessible We disliked having no mini fridge  microwave or coffee pot in the room. Only one ice machine on floor 16 worked. Can be long at wait at times for an elevator. Using room key for elevator security failed to work properly numerous times Talked to other guests who had this same issue.
10,Do NOT recommend. Worst Vegas fancy hotel ever. No coffee microwave or fridge in rooms. Elevator are so scary and loud. Really wish we would have stayed somewhere else. For the amount of $ we paid it was anything but great
10,Wake up in the morning to find out that neither the TV nor the WiFi was functioning checked out upset. Of all things this is the last thing one should expect from a hotel. One should at least be able to listen to the news while getting ready.
50,Traveled for a quick weekend away arrived at the hotel at around 11am Friday and to our surprise they had a room ready which we got to check in right away. Which was very convenient due to us having a concert Friday night and had to get ready for to meet up with friends that were staying at the other side of the strip!
20,The room was clean but definitely in need of some TLC.    Also the hotel room and hallway had a faint but consistent marijuana smell throughout our stay.    Overall staff throughout casino and restaurants and bars were friendly.    Definitely make sure you utilize mobile check-in. We saved ourselves an hour and a half or more but not having to wait in the check-in line.
50,This was a great hotel. The signal to the mobile key was choppy at times in the elevator but overall still a great stay. I have no complaints at all. The hotel was clean and they had sanitizer all over to use
40,I had no problems with this hotel after the long wait to check-in. The staff was friendly and very helpful. The room was super-clean and very quiet. I didn't hear any noise from the casino area at all.
10,Please do not choose this hotel You won’t have a good vacation experience staying with Luxor. 2hour wait in line to check in No internet nobody’s answering the phone poor service… everything else is below standards.
20,Rude staff while checking in. Huge volleyball festival of course it was slammed she acted inconvenienced. She was going to cancel my guaranteed early check in because they had given all the rooms away already then she said she'd upgrade me to get me in she actually downgraded me for the same price. She was the only staff member I spoke with. Next year I'd rather walk further if that's how they treat their guests.
50,I have been staying here for the last 7 yrs. love the place close enough to everything but not right in the middle of all the craziness. rooms are clean and staff is kind. Love the people that usually stay here.
40,I stayed 4 nights mid week it was uncrowded. Check in was fairly quick we stayed in a Tower room. Room was clean and roomy and had a nice walk in shower. Price is very reasonable rather than staying at a more expensive MGM property I use all the money I save for gambling shows and food. The Casino is ok but I prefer to take the short walk to the Mandalay Bay casino much bigger and nicer. I just love being in the pyramid it is such an iconic and cool hotel. A great value and decent rooms.
10,Staying at the Luxor was like staying at a motel. Save yourself the money and go elsewhere. The TV and WiFi were not working at all. The towels were small and thin. The bedsheets were so thin and worn out.
50,Best family little vacation and my kids were at a volleyball tournament and we love it thanks for doing a excellent job keeping the place clean and having a excellent costumer service and I’m looking forward to go back
10,TV Barely works Room was dirty and had garbage bag around smoke detector staff very unfriendly pool closed remote check in and digital key did not work so I had to stand in line for an hour with my 8 year old to get a key printed toilet leaked shower drained slow
40,Enjoyed the room - large desk plenty of room for luggage and large bathroom countertop  Decor was updated no view but my request to be on the first floor was accommodated  I thought the price of the room was overpriced and I had to pay for parking each day I was there
10,Mixed up reservation and the response was “sorry tough luck”. Out of date rooms. I slept on the floor for 4 nights because they gave us the wrong room and no roll away bed as promised. They did bring 2 extra blankets to make a bed on the floor. Front desk attendant physically shrugged her shoulders when I asked if there was option to switch rooms the next night.
10,"Check in was so very unorganized. My heat didn't work. Only blew out cold air and when they ""fixed"" it then it was only heat. Even with the heat off we were completely drenched in sweat. They never came back to fix it again when I went to ask for it. My son cut himself deep when just turning the knob. So much more to mention but overall so upset."
40,I've been staying at the Luxor the past couple times I've been coming to Vegas and I have enjoyed both stays. The rooms were spacious and the beds were comfortable. I haven't had a chance to stay in the pyramid rooms I've only stayed in the towers and they were good rooms.    The Luxor is just a nice affordable hotel. I love that it's not quite on the strip; it's just a few blocks south of it. It may seem boring because it's away from the action but that's exactly why I like it. You don't get all the noise from the strip but you're close enough to it that you can take the Deuce a few stops up.    I would definitely recommend this hotel on your next visit to Vegas.
10,The rooms during this stay where horrible. I would t recommend the Luxor. Bear in mind we stayed there 4 years ago and had a good experience. The rooms where very run down and needed a lot of work. Not happy at all
10,Rooms overbooked and could not get the room I had reserved and paid for. Members of my party had to wait 2 plus hours to Checkin. Paid too much money to end up having to sleep in a chair. Switched rooms and a/c didn’t work.
50,I was met by a woman named Myriam who worked in the Slot machine area. She made great conversation really looked out for me and made sure the waitresses checked on me! She even blessed me with a ticket to the buffet! Such a blessing and sweet Soul🤍 thank you for being YOU!
40,Exceptionally kind front desk nice rooms nice location plenty to do right at the resort! Wish the corner king room had whirlpool jets in the soaking tub but other than that a fantastic stay! We would return
10,Way overpriced had to pay for parking room very small  no refrigerator Fire Alarms keep going off. For that price you should expect a lot more. They try and nickel and dime you for everything  Hung that used to be included
40,We are avid travelers and stay in many hotels. However this is our first time in Las Vegas. We were a little disappointed that we didn't get to stay in the original pyramid portion of the hotel. We didn't know there were towers built with additional rooms. Had we know then I would've requested an original room. We went for our 10th anniversary and was really looking forward to staying in the pyramid.
40,While a bit dated it still is a cool property with good food friendly staff and decent gaming. Good location and easy to walk to other nearby properties. The bar staff were excellent. Public House and Diablo's are excellent.
10,Shared my comments earlier but I was very disappointed with my experience at the Luxor. So many issues encountered that its hard to list them all: elevators did not work consistently the digital room key did not work the casino smelled like smoke the hotel was understaffed Wifi did not work well etc.
20,My daughter and I traveled to Las Vegas for her volleyball tournament. We flew and arrived after 10pm. We went straight to the Luxor to check in. The line of guests waiting to check in was so long that it stretched into the casino area. It took 2 hrs to check in and we did not get into our room until after 1am. My daughter was so tired and had trouble getting up to meet her team at 6:30 am and on the court at 7am. I was told that the mobile check in feature for MGM Rewards did not work and is not available after 10pm nightly. Terrible. Also the shower head is on the WRONG SIDE of the shower and floods the floor every time you use the shower.    The Luxor was chosen as a “stay to play” hotel for the volleyball team. I will not be staying there again in the future if I have a choice.
30,Everything was fine but didn't like the fact that there was no fridge unless you wanted to pay another 25 per night. No microwave anywhere located in the hotel. The shower was weird and water sprayed all over the floor and counter due to it only being a half door.. it was clean. Rooms were cleaned daily which was nice since due to covid a lot of hotels dont do that anymore.
40,Staying at the Luxor was good stuff but paying over Twenty-five dollars for overnight parking wasn't good. Now add this high resort fee-so sad! I've often wondered if the Vegas strip hotels really want us to leave with a few dollars?
10,Was given an older seemingly broken down handicap-accessible room when not requested…Room was dirty upon arrival well past check-in time- hair in bathroom on the floor sink and counter dirty floor around the toilet looked as though someone had been sick and wasn’t cleaned up thoroughly. Bathroom sink wouldn’t drain and shower pressure in the handicapped shower was barely more than a dribble. Pieces of carpet near the AC was missing. Door lock malfunctioned frequently to where we couldn’t close the door all the way.  We were so disappointed as we paid quite a bit of money to stay 4 days over the long Presidents Day holiday weekend for our daughters volleyball tournament but didn’t feel like she had a clean comfortable space to rest in.    We had looked forward to this first time stay at the Luxor but unfortunately it will be our last time until accommodations are repaired and cleanliness is a priority.
30,Rooms need Refrigerator. Great housekeeping Check in is crazy long and the phone app does not work reliably. Bed needs memory foam topper. I am concerned that the elevators are not adequately maintained as the have LOTS of side to side movement I mentioned something to a staff member and he said they were old.
10,First time staying here - stayed in Tower and the hallways and rooms are dark and dirty feeling and very bland/boring. The bed was ok but terrible pillows. The casino smell was worst than most and the lack of hotel amenities/restaurants makes this not worth it.
20,Check in was long 2-3 hours long and got a one king bed room for 4 people the issue was resolved on Saturday after manager helped and resolved the problem with the reservation. Elevators were not working all the time and digital key worked sporadically.
40,friendly staff good location need more waitresses drinks come very slowly. Maybe some new slot machines. Don't care for the corner suites in. the pyramid. Prefer the suites in the tower. My fault I asked foe the corner suite.
20,The room was noisy it seemed like a window was open but it was not. Cars drag racing with load exhaust until 3AM. Helicopter tours sounded like they were in our room. Lumpy bed. No coffee in room no little fridge. Starbucks was 45 min wait for coffee.
10,They gave me the wrong room. I got a king bed instead of two queens and the room was dirty toothpaste in the sink and a dirty sex toy looking thing was in the bathtub! DISGUSTING and worst customer service
10,I will never recommend. If you are use to staying at Belliagio or other 4 or 5 star hotel than the Luxor will not be an option. Jack at front desk was rude to my wife and even though I was only comp 300$ back via LinLin which is Jack manager. I feel I should have been comp my whole stay.
40,Great place to stay but I was a little disappointed in the hidden fees and resort expenses that they don’t tell you about until you show up. It seems a little shady. But it’s fun to stay in a pyramid for sure.
50,We were upgraded to suite after overbooking and man was it nice. I feel like there needs to be more reasonable restaurants. Food prices  kill a working family. Room was very nice and clean. Shows were good.
20,Horrible customer service/front desk help digital keys only worked now and then TVs did not work no room service never ending lines to get help for them to say sorry cant/won't help you. Room lamps missing on/off knobs. Don't stay here.
20,We were attending volleyball tournament. This was the hotel that was suggested to us. Spending $800 for a weekend in Las Vegas with teenage children attending a sporting event seems a bit high especially if you are stuck in this dilapidated hotel.
10,The hotel moved a family of 3 to a single bed room. They provided a rollaway which caused debilitating back pain. They informed us the hotel overbooked and since we were booked through a 3rd party we were moved without prior notice. They did not resolve the problem.
40,Only problem was being awakened by housekeeping twice 10:45 and 11:00am after already paying a good amount of money for late checkout. After I woke up and answered the door and explained to housekeeping I paid for late checkout they said”Oh I see it on my paperwork now”. Not once but both times.
10,Rooms were super outdated and not clean. Bathroom had damage to the door and the towels were super rough. Amenities were sub-par. Elevators were filthy. Food at Pyramid Cafe was horrible. I will not be staying there again.
20,Rooms are shoddy...equivalent of a 2-star econolodge. Understaffed place in dire need of updates. The elevators were beat up trash piled up in common areas.    Smell of smoke everywhere though I suppose that is to be expected in a Casino. Despite a cool concept entire complex felt tired and in decline.
10,"Was visiting to celebrate a friend's birthday and decided to pay a little extra for the ""Stay Well"" room. I got a room with dust all over cup rings on the tables hard water build up in the shower peeling wallpaper overall a rundown room with no attention to detail. I manage a boutique hotel and I would have sent my housekeeper back to clean the room properly before allowing to check someone in. Also the elevator shakes horribly! Not sure if it's because it's so run down or because it goes up at an angle."
40,Great resort if you plan to stay but if you hope to enjoy the rest of the strip there is a lot of walking. Tram to Excalibur and Mandalay Bay but that is it and long wait time. No complimentary shuttle to airport it will cost you (was hoping this would be covered in resort fee but no)
30,I don’t want to say that I think they’re (the owners) are giving up but It’d be a hard conversation to deny if it came up. Once a great luxurious Casino and hotel it appears it could use a lot of help being great again. I hope it’s not one that sells gets demolished and rebuilt. It’s not actually old just starting to look and feel that way.
10,Very disappointing upon arrival contactless keys in app didn’t work no cell service in room shower didn’t drain it would over flow  Our truck got broken into and then we were told the cameras didn’t work  Room smelt moldy  We’ve stayed here in the past but it definantly has gone down  Which is very disappointing since we usually stay here every time  Won’t be going back
10,They gave away our room. Then placed us in a different room only to call 3 hours later to tell us to move out of that room and into another. They should have a) not given our room away and b) not asked us to switch rooms
50,Good trip. Good room. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . …………………………..::::::::::::::::::::::::;;;;;;::…………………………………..…………………………………………………………………….. ………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………..
20,We had a king size bed it was the most uncomfortable bed EVER. Our carpet was wet giving the room a musty smell. All they did was tell us that they would take our room off the market once we checked out. DO NOT STAY THERE!!!
10,Website says $40 actual $90. $25 min. Blackjack tables. No food service after 11 pm. Great room employees were awesome. $26 for valet parking as a guest? Would have loved to enjoyed my trip to Vegas.
50,Room was great. Although parking now you need to pay $15 per night when it should be free for guest. No coffee maker in the room. And bed is not comfy . Price is reasonable though. Will come back here for sure
50,The staff was super friendly. Loved the room everything was very well kept. Didn't have a problem finding my way around. Drinks there were on point. Didn't win anything but it was a great time. Going to come back in June bring more friends. This is gonna be my choice stay when I come to town. Close to airport. I loved the decor. Discounts with your room key inside the casino. I can't wait to come back when the pool is open.
10,This property is far and away the worst guest experience I have had travelling in my lifetime. From the shabby room to the terrible service and the overall dinginess of the property it's difficult to point out any positives.  The hotel rooms have those old rickety heading/cooling units that can be rather noisy and don't maintain effective climate control. Housekeeping is definitely hit and miss most of the staff seem pretty overworked and underappreciated you can tell they do not want to be in the building. There were exposed wires in the steam room of the spa that made me nervous and a piece of tile from the hot tub came out from under my foot almost face planting me on cement. There was trash on the floors of the spa and the promotional staff constantly trying to badger you in every part of the hotel casino floor etc. were so obnoxious it became nauseating. I could not have been more frustrated. First valentines day with my gal was certainly eventful.
30,We usually stay at the Excalibur but they didn't have any rooms with tubs in the room available so we stayed at the Luxor instead. The Pyramid Corner King Suite has a lot of space and a tub. It's a nice big tub and it's in a position where you can watch movies on the TV while soaking.  The room was very large. One side had a couch and TV while on the other was the bed tub and a TV. Without more people one side of the room won't be used. Kind of a waste of space but good for families. There was a refrigerator in the room.  The bathroom was large but the shower only has half a door so water goes everywhere. No towel racks either. No towel racks at all so we had to hang towels in random places.  There was no view other than the side of the Luxor and the back of buildings. It was dark in the room due to the tint of the Luxor. The TVs in the rooms did not have a good picture. The display did not use up the whole screen and the remote was cheap and aftermarket so nothing could be adjusted.  The elevators are old and do rattle but going diagonal was pretty cool. The walkways to the rooms have a railing but it seems a bit low- kind of dangerous for drunk people and kids. Not to mention I have seen teens spitting over the railings onto people dining down below.  The Luxor does have a decent food court. We dined on pizza and salads most of the time. I am always grateful for vegetarian food being offered.  The casino machines are not very forgiving. Video poker took our money quickly. The Excalibur machines seem to give more than the Luxor. In addition the bartenders made it a point to tell us we need to put money in the machine to get free drinks. Yes we know this. At the Excalibur they have the same rule but don't begin their hello with making you feel like a criminal.  The Blue Man Group is a great show to see on the cheap and getting to other hotels like the Excalibur and Mandalay Bay are an easy walk.
40,One of the older hotels on the strip and in some places like hallways and elevators (inclinators) it does show but the rooms seem to be getting a modern refresh in the pyramid and have everything you would need for a comfy stay. I didnt notice any excess noise during my pyramid room stay I've heard the tower rooms are even better but I cant confirm this. Staff were friendly and approachable also the rooms were cleaned daily which was a surprise during these strange covid times. I'd happily stay here again and the only reason I didn't give it a 5* review was the slightly aging nature of some areas as mentioned before.
20,Dirty bathroom in the hotel room no king rooms available even though that’s what I paid for and reserved. Took an hour to get checked in on arrival with only one person at the desk. Low payouts on slots
20,whole place smells like a sewer elevators where sketchy the whole places water was completely off no comp not even free water i dont know if they are just getting stuff back to normal or not cuz i know they lifted the mask stuff so there not use to bigger numbers again was not very happy by the end was looking forward to staying there cool looking place maybe ill give her another try one day
30,Great Atmosphere/Very Family Friendly.. Could have been a tad bit cleaner!! There was lots of dusk in the room. I paid to upgrade the bathroom however it was mediocre clean. Nice location with plenty to do.
30,Check-in was quick and provided our room quickly. We did arrive aroung midnight so that did affect the process. The room was clean and decent size. The walls are thin as you could hear the people in the adjacent room talking and spoiled brack fake crying. The shower did not drain very well and would fill up the bottom quickly. Daily housekeeping was provided. The amenities were nice but not all restuarants were open while we were there. The hotel is also towards the end of the strip so keep that in mind.
20,Our room was dirty oh wait the queen room they gave us was dirty. I booked a king room. But they denied me of that when we arrived. After waiting in the check in line for an hour. The sheets were stained the flat sheets they use as fitted sheets kept falling off. Matress was very uncomfortable. And despite me turning the fan on and turning it down to 65 the room was always too hot. The night stand underneath the glass was a red sticky substance the bathroom floor was not mopped properly. We encountered one nice staff member out of all of them we spoke to. Most of the food is overpriced. The vibe at the casino is not what I expected for Vegas. Its boring. Loud and exciting is much better. So we went to the cosmopolitan and they had just that. We loved it. May stay there next time. But not the luxor. Smoking is allowed on the casino floor. But my entire hallway to my room stunk of cigarettes. Might as well allow smoking all together. Also the luxor is at the beginning of the strip. Nothing very great around it. So you pretty much have to uber to a better strip location if you plan to walk it.
50,The only problem I had with my room it didn’t have a refrigerator nor microwave in it so I lost of lot of food because I didn’t have these items in my room. They need to have these things in every room.
10,I was robbed for the second time at the Luxor. Someone is getting into peoples rooms and taking things including money and nothing is ever done about it. The Luxor knows this is happening and dont care!!! Never stay here!!
30,Staff/service was excellent. Restaurants in Casino were very good and we tried them all. Gaming options good. Only one downfall rooms really need a refresh can tell they have had a lot of wear and tear and no updates have been made. No mini refrigerator or coffee pot in room. Stock minimally in towels no cups. Bathroom shower grout missing outdated same with room furniture very older looking.
30,Long lines at registration desks could be shorter if there was more staff. I didn’t feel safe walking to elevators in the East Tower. There should be security to go into the hallways. Hallways had many turns and long walk. Most people didn’t know how to use the keys to access an elevator to their floor. Hallways had strange smells. Toilet sounded like a bomb when it was flushed.  More signage around resort for amenities such as bathrooms etc

50,I love coming to this hotel every time I'm in Vegas because of all of art and shows . I will be coming back next month for business and I will be staying here once again. I'm hoping to see more shows that I haven't seen.
10,The room was dusty room phones did not work and no cell phone reception in the Luxor. We spent too much time at the service desk dealing with rude customer service. Extra long lines at service desk. Room key stopped working multiple times and had to be reset. Elevators got stuck multiple times. Printer had no paper to print boarding passes. It was just an overall mess. We would never choose to stay
50,Great service great hospitality as well as room cleanliness! The staff helped us move rooms due to our first room being on the first floor with a window view of the valet parking and got us moved to the 11th floor great view and no problem! Very nice and casino floor staff helped with directions around not only the hotel but where to get to other casinos faster!
30,Pleasant check-in but unfortunately the pyramid king room was unavailable. We ended up with a room with 2 queen beds instead. As a gesture of good-will our parking was waived during our stay.  The room was comfortable but could have been cleaned more throughly (carpet was dirty). We could hear the music from downstairs which disrupted our sleep.  Would not recommend.
20,Drab dreary dismal and dank is how we described this property to our friends. Room was small overlooking dirty rooftop and facing a building. In other words a room without a view. Video poker had terrible payouts. Also they were in a small area with no more than 20/25 machines.
40,The property was beautiful I was made aware of overbooking by 3rd parties at check in so had to settle for a single king instead of the planned 2 queen. They waived the resort fees as a result. But still would’ve much rather had what I had originally booked especially being an mlife member. Overall it was a pleasant stay. Did not hear a peep of the outside world while sleeping.
50,Thanks for the room the service was great and the room was excellent 👌 and it smelled great and decent and I didn't get disturbed for nothing at all the hall was nice and quiet and I would recommend it 😀
10,Outdated. Overpriced. Customer service was not quick or efficient at any time. It was dirty throughout the hotel. Few family friendly places to eat or relax. Pools were closed when all other hotels around had at least one open. Waiting 8hrs for a crib to be delivered when we asked for it before we arrived on our reservation at check in and again after a 30min wait on the phone. Room phones you couldn’t hear the other person. I could continue going on but it’s not worth my breath.
40,The room's needed to be more updated for electronic devices the shows we went to where great and other events.. ............... .............................. ..........................................
50,This is our second time we have stayed and have had enjoyable time each time. The hotel staff was very accommodating and helpful and helped us find a great room to meet our needs. The weekend got a little busy with some youth events going on but it didn’t cause any problems. Much security around keeping everybody safe!
40,Yes some minor touch ups are needed just from use the rooms get (scratches on furniture) but for the view comfort and great price it is no issue. Would definitely return. Floor 23 had great views. Please be aware cell signal is not the best on that height.
50,We went for our wedding the hotel was very good located and the service was beyond expected I highly recommended easy location the connection between 2 other hotels make it better and the rooms are really comfy / new
30,Hallway was very dirty lots of garbage and dirty linen was left overnight almost blocking my door when I walking to my room the bathroom was not clean properly was so much hair left by the floor and the tub was not clean.
50,The front desk employees very helpful. Casino was extremely clean. Room was clean issues with plugs. The plugs didn't keep the item plugged in it kept dropping out. The bathroom shower glass door wasn't long enough the water splashed out onto the floor making it wet even with towels down. Otherwise my stay was excellent.
20,This hotel is in desperate need of updates. Mobile check in was a nightmare making the chec. In line ridiculously long. It smelled of sewage/sulfer and our last night there no water to shower or brush teeth before catching our flight
30,…. It’s ok - Stayed in the tower room - Located at the south end of the strip. went for the weekend. Walked for most of the week - was not an issue. Great shows - Americas got talent and blue man group
10,Don’t stay here! Too many other options.  AC didn’t work in room called multiple times. Returned to room later after a long day to find room never has been cleaned nor has AC been addressed. Rooms dirty outdated and run down. No mini fridge.  Large AC units outside our rooms on the inside and they are filthy see pics. Dirty hand towel with hair on it. Hair on bed linens.  Too many other properties to go to. Don’t waste your time here. I will never return and may never stay in any MGM property due to poor service.
50,From Check In to Check Out ...we had a great experience at the Luxor. Our Casino Host - Scott was fantastic as always! The food was good as was the service every day while there. We will be going back next time and looking forward to it!
50,We came to Las Vegas for Valentine's Day week and had a great stay at Luxor. The entertainment and the room were very good. We loved how convenient the layout of the hotel is. A few other hotels that we went to had long sprawling layouts but the design of the pyramid has everything centrally located within the one building and adjoining tower. The views from the room levels of the Atrium are awesome. The Bell staff was very friendly and the cab stand staff were wonderful. Housekeeping did a great job everyday. The Buffet is great and there are plenty of other good choices to eat and drink at.
40,im a returning visitor. They are super nice here all of the staff from housekeeping to bar tenders to desk the entire hotel are to be commended for exceptionl service. I will gladly stay here again as soon as its warmer and can use the pool area.
30,The Luxor has become very impersonal. It’s hard to communicate with staff. We couldn’t get towels for the last day of our trip. No fridge in our room or coffee station. There was also a bad smell in the hallway of our room.
50,For the price we paid the hotel was very nice. Very clean and easy to find your way around. Great location on the strip not to busy but enough your never board. Great hotels to visit on both side and you can walk to everything.
50,I love my stay at Luxor. I will most definitely recommend to family and friends. I wish that at least one of the pools are open during February. It would be great to have access to a pool at Luxor....
50,Late 28th anniversary Valentines Day and NFL Superbowl made it an fun and exciting celebration trip!! Visiting the Strip Downtown Restaurants and all the shopping ALWAYS make it a GREAT TIME in Las Vegas!!!
30,Service sucked and elevators are horrible. House keeping and the buffet is where I had the best service overall. Since it is at the end of the strip you do have to Uber to many of the hotels. Prices to stay are high for not as good services
30,I will only Stay only if it’s free. While the staff was amazing the digital check in failed to give elevator instructions. The room was not as clean as it should be. I found dust hair and the toilet was not cleaned such that there was something on the under seat
40,Hotel was clean as well as my room. The hotel restaurants was a little pricey but the food was good and the portion sizes was just enough. Riding in the elevators was a nice experience when traveling at an angle.
10,Rough . Housekeeping was barely done. Water was turned off on the last night . Bell service was at least nice. Construction or not the overall experience was not great    See previous comments………………………..
10,Vegas has turned into a very large mall with ridiculous resort and parking fees with overpriced food and beverage rude and non friendly casino employees and dated shows no more fun here nothing different than your local mall here except for way more expensive
50,Staff was fantastic everyone that we talked to that worked there from the front desk to the restaurants were very helpful and kind. The room was clean and very comfortable. Our trip with amazing and definitely recommend this place
40,My boyfriend and I stayed here for Super Bowl 2022 Valentine's Day and his birthday! We REALLY enjoyed and LOVED our room which had a hot tub super comfy bed a desk area a very neat lounging area free fridge a walk in shower with a spacious bathroom area and housekeeping was super nice and helpful. The only thing that really sucked about this place was that our room was located right above the fast-food area which made the hallways and our room smell so incredibly bad. Despite that we has an awesome time the inside of the Luxor is super interesting and a cool spot to have an adventure.
40,My boyfriend and I went to the Luxor for our birthdays and Valentine’s Day. And it was a wonderful stay! Definitely would recommend to a friend. It was a bit off the strip but the city is walkable so it wasn’t too concerning!
50,It was a perfect stay for me and my girlfriend we loved the bar the casino the lounge the club the views the room it’s a great scene full of great people close to the strip so you can walk around and enjoy all the other casinos views clubs bars etc  It was a fun memorable experience hopefully they open up the pools to try that out
40,Luxor will continue to be an affordable option for those looking to stay on strip. Although I typically earn comps for other higher end casinos I selected Luxor specifically for the Big Game Watch Party.    The room itself was not bad however the buttons for our for in one of the elevators were stuck. We would need to take a different elevator which was a mild inconvenience. I had no complaints with the room itself.    The casino has always been one of my favorites to play at due to its spaciousness and atmosphere. The walk to and from the parking garage is terrible however but considering it's a pyramid you have to get past it's not the worst thing in the world.    I've visited attractions at the Luxor many times in the past and outside of the casino floor the attractions are the resort's saving grace. I did not see an attraction this time around however the big game watch party was my favorite moment during my stay.    If I was invited to a watch party on the future I would absolutely consider attending at the Luxor again. The setup was amazing the staff was friendly and the food and drinks were on point. Next to actually being at the Super Bowl it was the best way to watch the game.    Overall the Luxor has its hits and misses. I didn't have a terrible stay to be honest and the room was better than I had expected. I will continue to visit Luxor to game but can't say whether or not I would stay again.
50,The Luxor is our favorite hotel in Las Vegas it is comfortable reasonably priced and easy to navigate and park our car in self-park. The staff is friendly and helpful also. The location is perfect in our opinion as it is not in the really hectic part of the Strip but a bit quieter and not as hectic as most of the rest of the Strip.
20,Mattress sucked. No fridge. No microwave. No coffee maker. The AC didn’t work. Buffett was mediocre. Elevator shook several times. Cocktail servers were very slow. Just not worth the money as advertised.
10,Old and dated. Booked the deluxe king room. Room didn't even have the minimum amenities I would expect from a Days Inn motel. No cups no glasses. Nothing extra. Room was ground floor and abutting a parking lot.
30,"The staff was friendly. The titanic exhibit was alright. The location was okay. Pools were no open but use of the mandalay bay pool was fine (bar and resturant at the pool was closed ""indefinitely"". Bring your own snacks and drinks!)  All in all it was fine but I highly doubt we stay at the luxor again."
10,Our first room reeked of smoke we were moved. The next room was better but as soon as we left for the night our room was broken into. They entered our room stole my purse and several other expensive items. We were encouraged by hotel security and staff to not file charges and have the money taken off our stay. Because we didnt want to wait months to recover the money we lost we accepted but we just got the final charges and they did not take off the amount they said they would. THis is an awful hotel no ammenities and the staff steals your stuff while you are down stairs. BEWARE
50,My wife and I stayed at the Luxor for three nights and we could not have had a better experience. The staff were friendly the room was very clean the food was delicious and the location on perfect to explore the rest of the strip and other sites in Las Vegas. I would absolutely recommend the Luxor to anyone looking for an affordable and excellent place to stay in Las Vegas.
30,Overall was good. Favorite casino visited with amazing staff.  Room was better than expected for the price. No refrigeration which was a bummer and some parts of the ceiling were concerning in hallways. Beware of elevators especially at check out time you will likely wait 15+ minutes.  Overall for a budget stay I would recommend.
40,Came in town to my mum birthday trip. The bed and pillows where soo amazing and that shower awesome such good pressure. Check in could be batter we arrived on a Monday and the line was ridiculous. If you stay at a MGM property definitely do the Mobile Check in and make your room keep at the kiosk
50,Love every moment of my stay!! Can’t wait to come back. Rooms clean casino clean all staff very friendly and helpful. You want regret your stay here it’s the best and right at the end of the strip away from all the ruckus.
10,Worst hotel room I’ve ever stayed in  We were scared of bed bugs based on how filthy the room was I will never come back . This experience might make me stop coming to Vegas I’ve never felt so cheated must of the customer service people were rude over the once I walked down Logan did try to help but nothing was fine
30,I’ve been here before and never an issue. But today there was and never got resolved.the guests in the room next to us were extremely loud literally yelling all night long. It was hard to sleep water was left outside the door on the floor. There was a wet mop sign in front of the puddle.
50,Had a great week even enjoyed the Super Bowl. The staff was very helpful and accommodated us with whatever we wanted. I certainly recommend to stay here again Plenty to do in the hotel and close enough to Mandalay Bay and the Excalibur
30,I enjoyed my stay at the Luxor despite reading bad reviews and what not. We went there for business got great rates and the staff were wonderful. It was 115° during our stay and the AC couldn't keep up (not surprising) but the staff brought us a box fan that really helped out a lot. The fan helped cool the room and the noise was great at night. It wasn't the nicest hotel in Vegas but it wasn't bad by any means. I enjoyed my stay there. Vegas is awesome!
10,Horrible gave me a basic room when I paid for a one bedroom suite didn’t make it right till two days later and still paid more than I should have. Room was dirty nothing working will never come back do not stay there
20,Beware a charge for parking with or without MGM rewards. Also be prepared for very long wait times to redeem rewards. Seems like they want to deter you from redeeming rewards by super long wait times.
20,The hotel charged me nearly double what I paid to book the hotel in additional resort fees no amenities in room very poor customer service no vouchers or extra incentives. A very costly birthday for??
40,The location of Luxor is convenient for walking almost anywhere on the strip. The accommodations are nice even if I didn’t get the room I actually booked. The food at the restaurants was good but rather expensive for what you got. Mobile checkin was way however it didn’t assign a room so I had to stand in line anyway. The shows were awesome!!
30,To start off I’ve been working in hospitality for about 6 years now with my latest position being Executive Housekeeper. So I’m familiar with the industry.    I booked a pyramid king room and checked in around 1am but was only able to be checked into a tower queen room. I paid for an upgrade to a pyramid corner suite and was told by the front desk agent that it would be available later that morning. Between 5am and 12pm I visited the front desk 3 times inquiring about the room move. Was last told I would be called in roughly 20 when the room attendant was finished servicing the room. After not receiving any calls I return to the front desk around 430pm. The agent told me the room was no longer available. She stated that a front desk agent wasn’t able to get a hold of me so they left a message (I did NOT receive a message on my cell phone NOR my room phone) She then proceeded to tell me the room was out of order after I stated the room was suppose to be on hold for my reservation. Again being in the hospitality industry I was familiar with the operating system and could see the room status on the computer screen from where I was standing and it did NOT say “out of order” but instead said “occupied”. After being told there was nothing I could do at this point I then spoke with another front desk agent who reaffirmed that the room was SOLD and not placed out of order. She moved me to a higher floor but same room type.    As an executive Housekeeper the condition of the second room was not up to standard but at that point I didn’t want to have to move again being that I was there to celebrate my birthday so I had arrangements to be fulfilled.    To make things worse I couldn’t charge ANYTHING to my room and the only explanation I got was that MAYBE my bank that it was suspicious that my card was being used in Las Vegas. Oddly enough EVERYTHING else EVERYWHERE that weekend was able to charge my card even the one of the restaurants that suggested I call my bank (which is funny because it was the same card I ultimately had to use in order to pay for the food after he suggested I call my bank that was being rejected for my room charges)    Could of been a better trip and my biggest complaint is that I was lied to on multiple occasions in order to pacify and temporarily alleviate an issue that had a fairly simple resolve. Oh and one of the room attendants walked straight into my room on 3 separate occasions asking when I will be leaving on my first day
30,Don't use the app to check into your room. Don't use the app to check into your room. Don't use the app to check into your room. Don't use the app to check into your room. Don't use the app to check into your room. Don't use the app to check into your room.
30,The hotel itself is unique but it lacked conveniences. No fridge microwave coffee maker and USB/alarm charging ports. The rooms are outdated but clean. The location is at the South end of the strip.
50,Over all i loved it the Luxor hotel. I wish at least one of the pools were open. But over all the bedrooms were beautiful with a beautiful view of the pyramid in the West Tower. The people where supper friendly. The hotel was clean and very well kept up. Was very said that the buffet was only open on Sunday until 3 pm. There premier Cafe was delicious very fast service. Will definitely tell all my friends and family that are going as an adult getaway about it.
10,one of the worst trips since going to Vegas Luxor in need of major repairs and updates. No fridge no coffee pot no microwave. sink drained slow. elevators run down lights for floors not working. Over all not stay here ever again.
10,Ghetto unprofessional unorganized overpriced for lower quality employees are uneducated in their roles just one of the worst experiences I’ve have had so far in Vegas. Then to top this off. Mlife goes and changes their point system just as I was nearing platinum status. Done.
40,fun valenties day trip room was ok nothing special it is neat going in evevator to room and being able to look down to casino on the way to room very unusall try not get a room with door to other room it does get alittle noisy fromt he neighbors
10,Check in was a fiasco they tried to downgrade my Prepaid room with no compensation Staff was rude if you could find one  Room was mediocre Service was very poor  Rooms were sub-par. I would not stay her ever again
10,Never again!!! Room was outdated and not clean staff was cool hotel was booked so couldn’t move rooms. There was hair all around the room mirrors were dirty. Shower was dirty. Sheets were rough pillows were trash
40,The Luxor is very close to everything on the strip. The rooms are nice although the ones that we had did not have a coffee maker or a fridge. That was the stay well room I believe. The café in the Luxor is really good and the mobile check in with the staff assistance was super fast.
50,Really would have enjoyed the pyramid room I reserved but It was not available when I checked in. So u was very disappointed front desk substituted another room on a low floor. Not a good view at all. But overall nice hotel
10,Downgraded because MGM over books rooms. Booked our room 8 months in advance to be told rooms are assigned on first check in basis regardless of when reservations are made. Don't stay here if you are looking forward to the room you actually booked.
50,Meet up with family here and we enjoyed it so much we never left! Tables and slots was paying off. The food at the restaurant’s and at the food court was good. The entertainment was good. I’m looking forward to my next stay here!
50,This was a great experience. Overall we loved it there. Staff rooms casino restaurants and shows were all terrific. Great location on the strip with so much very close by. Only negative I would say is the room didn’t have a refrigerator.
50,Awesome room and great customer service. Clean room and casino was good. I will recommend Luxor to my friends and family. Check in was fast and easy. Had a great experience in the hotel room. I would definitely go back to Luxor.
30,Not much to do. The restaurants are expensive and underwhelming for the price. There is no room service and they don’t let doordash access the rooms so you’re pretty much out of luck. Not the worst but definitely not the best. Overall a pretty boring place.
10,Dirty rooms no appliances short on towels and no complimentary “lotion or shampoo” and called ahead of time for rooms with specific things that needed to have and we got the exact opposite after they told us they reserved specifically what we asked for
50,This hotel has great views of gorgeous landscapes inside and outside. Highly suggest this for the value. Very clean rooms. Only downfall is the pyramid elevators probably haven’t been maintained since it’s opening.
40,My stay good but the room was not what I was expecting. The room was the only one with out a door light our ironing Board was broke the mattress smelled like smoke The bathroom floor got very wet from the shower and the fan was extremely loud. But Honestly the hotel was amazing just the room sucked. I was really expecting a mini fridge in the dusty cupboard Below the tv that had horrible picture. I definitely would stay there again but in a suite I heard they were way better and worth the money.
50,Excellent staff and. Overall accommodations and all restaurants were excellent! Other than the few incidents that I mentioned previously; that are very unusual  I would stay at Luxor for my next cross country trip!
10,I booked a premium pyramid room weeks in advance. Luxor even took my money. Took 12 hrs for mobile key to arrive on phone. When I got my room it was a crappy tower room. The line to check in and talk to a person was over 75 people long. Impractical. Called the number and was given message to call back during normal business hours. Next morning I had to argue with staff that I shouldn't be charged for crappy room. Was offered food and beverage credit instead. That does nothing for me when it was the room I wanted. Staff acted like they did me a huge favor lowering my rate. IT'S NOT A FAVOR TO BE CHARGED FOR THE CRAPPY ROOM AT THE LOWER RATE THAN A PREMIUM ROOM AND RATE!!! Did I mention I made my reservations weeks prior?? And it made no difference to them. I understand exact rooms aren't guaranteed. But seriously you should automatically adjust the rate if I don't get what I booked for!!!
10,Never had a representative answer the calls was stuck on ringing attempting to call the front desk from both the hotel phone and cellphone for over 10+ minutes. My pillows also smelled like a wet dog.
30,The Luxor staff was great however the place is very very dated. Time to remodel to keep up with everything else that’s going on around it. Also need to have more restaurants available during the week. Even though the rooms were dated the beds were very comfortable and did not hear a lot of noise from the other guests.
50,The service is great the rooms are clean but the window curtain is hard to close due to the slanted window design. The safe is locked and not readily useable may need to call the front desk to unlock. No microwave oven and fridge are available in the room I stayed in for 3 nights..
50,Wonderful night stay at the Luxor hotel and Casino everyone was so sooo very nice! And room was very tighty! Thank you! Room was a little close to the hallway and the elevators but was still very nice!
10,Room was filthy when entered. Had to change rooms. Daughters room was broken into and several thousands worth of property was stolen. Took a lawyer threat for them to finally comp the room for the trip.
30,The casino is nice and the staff is friendly. Make sure that you check your room to make sure that everything is good before settling in. If its not alert the front desk immediately. This hotel is not my top pick. Do your research thoroughly.
20,The room (15205) was very good The atmosphere of the casino was stellar! However the service at the front desk staff needs better quality service during check out.    We were told by my friend who went back out of state that we had to check out of the room by 6 p.m. as he was made aware around 4:30 p.m. that the room was only good for two nights--not three nights as originally advertised. My friend and I arrived at the hotel by 5:15 p.m. in order to try to get our stuff out as soon as possible. We tried to use the room key in the elevator but it did not work. So we asked some guests to use their room key to get us close to the 15th floor--we walked up five flights of stairs! We went to the room and the room key was disabled; so we went back down the elevator to the front desk while waiting in the check-in/out line for 15 minutes. The front desk alerted me that we had to pay a late fee and other fees which was around $235 total! We were told that the room key would be in use/made once the fees were paid. When we paid the fees the front desk was alerted of a security reference. So they were told to dispatch security up to the room to unpin/unlock the room. So after we were good at the front desk we tried to go up the elevator to use the room key as we were promised that the room key was good to use. Sadly the key didn't work; so a guest took us to the 20th floor and we had to go down five flights of stairs! We waited over 1/2 an hour before security was dispatched (I was told by the front desk that security was sent as soon as we were clear to obtain our stuff). Then once security arrived I was made aware that the original person that was on the room account was to show their ID; however he already traveled back to his home state. At that point security checked on their earpiece to ensure that we were cleared to obtain our things. Then security got the okay signal to unlock the room.    The whole above process took about an hour and a half! As a result the hotel never showed empathy did not apologize for the issue or compensated us. They also did not even attempt to give us a room for another night due to the mix-up. All of this could have been handled much smoother and efficiently.
40,We checked in late check in lady was ver nice and friendly. She upgraded our room to a higher floor. I let her know this was our first time staying here. When we got to the room the View from the room was very nice we could see the air planes in the morning take off. Great friendly housekeepers we all know they’re the ones who keep the facility nice. Esp when they clean the rooms after everyone stays.
30,Room was very clean. Beds extremely comfortable. Elevator keys to access your floor for your room needs work. Spent plenty of time on elevator trying to just get to our floor. Staff extremely friendly. Just one serious issues with a cocktail waitress on casino floor who was extremely rude.
10,The room was not clean. Dirty carpets bathrooms and dusty. No fridgemicrowave or coffee maker in the rooms. Long lines to check in and they wouldn't allow extended checkout without paying a fee. The hotel did store my luggage after checkout which as the only good part.
20,Will not be returning. Room/view was lacking for the extra price. No mini fridges for leftovers or drinks. Room was constantly hot keeping us up during the trip. Everything is digital check in so we didn’t speak to anyone. The resort fees which include parking wifi fitness center pool etc is a joke. Majority of guests including myself used 0 of the amenities.
30,needs an update. once a very good casino now just a catchy visit spot. lower end on the price spectrum. good value compared to others just a bit dated. beds were hard but room amenities were good. will think twice about staying here again but for the right price will stay again.
40,I love the Luxor and have been coming once or twice a year for almost a decade. The rooms are great the atmosphere is great and the resort is easy to navigate. However with the change in the rewards system I will likely go someplace else next time that doesn't try to twist my arm to spend more money. Take home: Great place but the new MGM Rewards is TERRIBLE.
10,WE booked a King size Bed & were downgraded  We paid in full online & were charged a lot more  Charged me for parking even though I am a veteran & MGM member  TV did not work well we called but never sent TV Repairman  Did not clean our room on Sunday
10,If your okay with staying in a motel but paying hotel prices then I’d said go for it but if you want what you pay for avoid it at all cost: the hotel isn’t clean and the staff isn’t friendly at all. I would choose another hotel next time. The pool was down key cards don’t work digital keys don’t work either
40,One of my favorite casino floors. Rooms and elevators could use some updating. I like the rewards program and it does have one of my favorite casino floors. Probably better floor service than most placed I've been into in vegas
40,Stayed for Superbowl weekend with a friend and had a great time. First time in Vegas and wasn't disappointed in the Luxor at all. The building is beautiful an the staff is very helpful and accurate. Recommended
20,Poor service  elevators did not work  unable to get assistance from front desk and seemed to be ignored every time we made a phone call. Poor service  elevators did not work  unable to get assistance from front desk and seemed to be ignored every time we made a phone call.
30,Everyone was super patient and helpful. The app went to poo on me and i had to deal with someone face to face which I dread. This trip wasthe exception to my hesitation because staff was helpful and not rushed or rude
30,It was a decent stay on the strip. The room was outdated but decent for the price. No refrigerator or microwave unfortunately. The timeshare people are super pushy and it was bothersome. The buffet is not all day. You pay about 30.00 for a buffet but if you leave that’s it.
40,I stayed at Luxor and it was a nice hotel. Very nice staff. I thought the price for my room was alitte expensive. Would have enjoyed a room with a view at least. But overall good stay. Next time I’d probably update my room.
30,room was not as clean as expected and shower area was very bad as it had lots of cracks and the edges was very dirty and had holes. the caulking was all falling off and showed lots of cracks in it. bed was very hard. during check in was not an easy task as we didn't get much help doing so also while getting our car from Valet we noticed 2 guys came in the vehicle and music loud as they've come from a cruise in my car. was not to happy on that part as i noticed my gas was a 1/4 of tank less for no apparent reason.
20,They haven’t upgraded in 20 years. The check in staff were rude. The slots are wayyy too tight. The cost of everything is outrageous. No fridges and only half a shower door so water goes everywhere. I still haven’t figured out why they charged a resort fee when I saw no resort or anything that resembled a legit resort. The Luxor used to be a symbol of luxury but now it’s a has-been washed up motel that charges what the big casinos charge without actually providing it.
40,"While the hotel may not be as fancy as others and we know because we usually stay at ""the others"" it is fun personable and not as crazy busy as other MGM properties. Our only concern is the elevators. They really need to do some maintenance on them!"
40,Visited vegas for the first time on a business trip compensated rooms by the company. I found it personally exciting to stay in the same hotel Tupac spent his last night alive (side note). The rooms were decent where I spent my nights. The hotel is very convenient connects to several other casinos and has just about everything you might need within it. The room service was particularly friendly and polite checking in time to time as I slept sometimes through the day they would be sure to return and tidy up without disturbing my schedule. We also utilized a couple conference rooms and the Velvet room which was all very nice. The top floor suites are where it at though! Gym was very convenient and well equipped. I even took a walk to Flamingo & Koval before departing got some great photos through the city and was all within 2 miles!
30,Between the rude management the smell of cigarettes in a none smoking room an the ashs on the floor of my bathroom and the rude attitude of the front desk blaming me saying i put all of it there was completely unexpected and very stressful definitely not worth my money
50,Beautiful hotel and in walking distance to many attractions on the strip. My wife and I were disappointed with the view or no view from our room but the manager graciously moved us to a different room for the remainder of the weekend. Great customer service and will definitely stay at this property again soon.
30,So.. visited the Luxor for a week in Feb 2022 from the UK. I’ve been to Vegas a few times and have stayed at a few hotels along the strip. I was a little anxious about the hotel as I had read a few negative reviews but all was booked so not much could do about it. Arrived at the hotel after a long flight around 3pm local time and the queue at reception to check in was absolutely enormous. I couldn’t believe my eyes it filled the lobby with people everywhere and thought would be there for hours and hours. Waited just over an hour in the end as it did move pretty quick but only seemed to be about five team members working on the desks. The room type I had booked wasn’t available (not sure why and I didn’t really ask as was so tired) so was given a similar room in the west tower I asked for a high floor which was arranged by a really lovely chap on reception who was really jolly and friendly. Stayed in a tower premier king room which was a nice size very comfortable bed decent air con and reasonably clean but a little bit dusty. Room was cleaned every day and had fresh towels every day. Hotel is pretty amazing and really something when standing in the middle of the atrium looking up at the pyramid. The  Food court which is standard across most mgm resort hotels is quite reasonably priced but the mini markets within the hotel are so expensive. Have a short walk out on the strip and pop into a supermarket there are several if want to grab any essentials like water juice or snacks. Keep in mind there is no kettle or fridge in the rooms which I do find strange! Most hotels provide these as standard now. Mgm really need to up their game! Hotel corridors lifts and hotel areas like casino were a little dirty! I was surprised by that. Bins over flowing rubbish stacked up or guests had dropped things and they were there for days! A few times I picked up empty cartons and put them in the bins. They need a team constantly overseeing the cleaning of the public areas I think.    Wifi in the tower rooms seemed non existent really was so hit and Miss could barely get connected. Was a little annoying as ended up just having to use my own data. Connection was brilliant down in the casinos etc.. funny that! The pool was closed which I wasn’t aware about until went to have a look. If I had known I probably would have stayed somewhere else where the pools were open. Having stayed at a few other hotels along the strip where pools were open I just assumed they were all open all year. I don’t really remember seeing it well advertised that the pools were closed during ‘winter months’ but if you search website etc then you can find the info but it’s not obvious. For me anyway! Used the pool at the Mandalay Bay which was fine but did get very busy and there is a maximum capacity (assume COVID related) so once hits that then they do stop allowing access. I was surprised to see a lot of sunbeds reserved with towels etc put on them but no one using them. Think the hotel pool side staff need to be a bit more focused on that if they are going to limit capacity. Doesn’t seem very fair. I was there all afternoon and some ‘reserved’ beds were never used! There is a gym at the Luxor which is a really good size and a really good selection of equipment and open 24 hours with keycard access for guests. I went every day and wasn’t very busy at all. Seemed busier 8am-10am sort of time but on occasions I was the only person in there. Seemed the better gym of the hotels I’ve stayed at previously in vegas. Most of the staff I met like the cleaners gym reception etc were all really friendly and jolly but I have to tell you about an experience in Diablos Cantina the Mexican restaurant in the hotel. Booked a table and arrived on time but was told the table wasn’t ready and to wait at the bar (I noticed there seemed to be lots of empty tables made up) and the bar staff were awful. So rude and had such a poor attitude that I decided I didn’t want to eat there and left. Explained to a member of the staff at the door that I was leaving due to the attitude of the lady on the bar but they just shrugged shoulders at me as if to say ‘oh well’. Explained what had happened to a member of reception who said they would ensure feedback passed on but I don’t think they took it seriously. Really annoyed me. I wouldn’t go back to the restaurant! Awful staff. Don’t give them your money. Take a walk out to the strip there are a few nice places which are better priced. I also have to say about security… there were some homeless people who seemed to be living or sleeping inside the building. I don't mean that to sound unkind at all please don’t think I do but just surprised me. One or two did seem quite vocal so made me feel a little bit uneasy. Also every single night quite late often after 10pm I seemed to get a handful of takeaway food menus shoved under the door! They were for external companies to the hotel so I wondered how they were getting there. One evening I came across a guy delivering them and it didn’t seem he had official access just waited around until he could get in the lifts and access to a floor with another guest going up. Also a few times there were random people waiting around and would get in the lift and didn’t have a keycard. All seemed very laid back which is not something I’ve seen before at the other hotels in vegas I’ve stayed at.    Also…. I hired a car and used the car park but was overcharged for the parking for an extra night. I went to reception to ask about this but the queue was enormous again so decided to call them from my room and I waited on the phone for nearly 40 mins! When I finally got through the agent on the phone argued with me a little bit that I must have used the car park on that date but I explained I didn’t even have the car then so couldn’t have! Eventually they refunded one night parking but I did feel  I had to argue for that. Customer service fell really short of what I would expect. I know a fair few negatives there but all in all it was a good stay and the hotel has some good points and some good staff but I wouldn’t stay again. The Diablos incident really upset and annoyed me especially when there was no acknowledgement or apology about it and the lack of security really did worry me. I think they really do need to up their game now brush up on customer service think about kettle and fridge in room and sort out the wifi!!!
10,The whole experience was ruined because all we could smell was weed inside and outside the casino. There was no escaping it. I don’t recommend visited this hotel or Vegas strip. The room doesn’t even have a fridge so don’t even bother trying to save leftover food and have fun dieing of thirst with the 4 oz bottle of water they give you.
30,Luxor is cheap so not stay at the pyramid rooms they are old and noisy recommend the tower rooms but those still need deep cleaning…. The gore is at the end of the main attractions so get ready to walk far
30,Hotel bathroom had poor tile maintenance with bad caulk repair. No room service and pool was closed probably because it was off season and Covid related but I wish they would have told me when I booked the the two room suite. We had a mysterious itchiness after showering and in the middle of the night. Bed and pillows were good but needed a heavier comforter or bed spread.
40,The hotel room was spacious and very clean. Throughout our stay housekeeping did a great job servicing our rooms. Laura w/ housekeeping was very nice and helpful willing to make things great for the guests. Check in was also great.
50,Good time in Vegas again. Was fortunate enough to take in the George Strait concert at T-Mobile and then The Black Crowes at Mandalay Bay House of Blues. Luxor didn't disappoint again. We've stayed here numerous times and enjoy it and it's location to all things on the strip.
40,Just ok. Could’ve been a lot better I remember going to this casino way back when and it was really nice but it’s kinda run down now bartender was good machines were OK rumors are some hidden fees kind of sucked
30,"Hotel service is okay. There are limited dining options with many closing early. The hotel is beat up in some places and new in others. Pur room was missing it""s fridge. There was an issue with the room safe which took nearly two hours to resolve causing us to cancel reservations waiting for repair. Front desk would not give eta and did not seem to care. They offered to remove the resort fee for the day but did not follow up. Also you can not enter or leave the casino floor as a couple without being harrassed by time share sales"
40,Excellent staff! Good food! Lacking in the cleaning and room amenities… elevators are rough and don’t read cards well so you have a tendency to go up and down a few extra times over your stay. We would go again but plan for lower or ground floor rooms if possible.
50,Love Luxor nice time for super bowl time was great just needed more to be open to eat after 8pm everything was closed had to take snacks from gift shop wasting 40.00 that we would have rather spent on hot food
10,Typically getting a drink in Vegas is a breeze but not at the Luxor Resort and casino they make it almost possible and the waitresses are not helpful and the higher ups didn’t do much as well. Extremely disappointed in this casino was my first time there and will likely be my last time.
40,We brought our youngest to watch George Strait and the location of the hotel was perfect . Our room was recently remodeled and was nice . Only issue we had was the elevators not working properly. Definitely need to be worked on  otherwise our stay was great . Dinner at Tender was fantastic!
30,An average Vegas stay room. Don’t expect it to be a spotless clean room but overall it was just okay. I would advise to bring some wholes to just give frequently used surfaces another wipe. The staff was friendly though.
40,Cons: Make sure your room has good outlets there’s no room service option  Pros: Less smoky and cleaner than other casinos and hotels on the strip.The wait for the pyramid cafe isn’t long and the food is pretty good.
20,We stayed at the Luxor Hotel for my sons 21st bday was not impressed to say the least. The Hotel is way overpriced for the shape the hotel is in. My daughter was ina room 3 down from me her TV did not work in my room the sink was stopped up and the tint pealing off the windows. The ice machine area was filthy there were worn cloths thrown down next to trash can. The elevators haver graffiti in them some key pads dont work the floor number displays dont work. The maid service I had a do not disturb sign on my door they entered anyway. This hotel is no better than thge Motel 6 very disappointed in my value for this hotelno water in the rooms we stayed at golden nugget while we were in town much nicer hotel and way older but very well kept compared to the Luxor i will not recommend this hotel to anyone nor will I return.
10,Never again hotel is old and things break down all the time. Elevators worked half the time. No fridge gambling tables were too expensive. Way too smoky like the air filters didn’t work. Very warm on casino floor
10,Staff was rude room was absolutely disgusting. Not clean tv didn't work phone didn't work took pictures to show the front check in staff and they didn't even want to see them. Asked for another room and they were irritated about it and didnt want to give me one. After i did get a new room it was still not clean. Hair in the floor of the bathroom food on floor from previous guest and the air conditioner was not cold. Will NEVER stay at the luxor again!
30,The restaurants atrium shoppes and casino in the Luxor are top notch. The room is mediocre. Especially for the price. King Room has no Microwave or Fridge. A/C broke on us but they fixed it. Housekeeping was 10/10. Location on the strip is 10/10.
20,Booked a place at the pyramid got transferred to tower. The hotel staff was not able to help us for 2 days ans we finally gave up. They kept telling us they didn’t have any availability even tho we booked directly with the hotel.
10,If you book in advance it’s considered a request not a reservation so don’t plan on getting the right room when you arrive to check in. Also check in takes multiple hours and if you want the room you originally booked it’ll take hours to get it if you end up getting it at all.
40,We were generally pleased with the room amenities except we had to request a refrigerator with a one-time fee. As expected the $150 security deposit was returned but I noticed the final charge was over $60 more than I'd expected. I contacted guest relations Luxor Guest Relations <GuestRelations@luxor.com> and after my folio was reviewed the representative reported that we were charged a $25 daily fee for the refrigerator. The overage will be refunded. If you need a receipt get in line when you check out. We did not want to wait and then discovered the overcharge upon review of the final debit from the Luxor. I do thank Guest Relations as Crystal was prompt and professional in her responses. As for the walking distance from the garage to the rooms once we knew where we were going it felt good to walk.
10,This hotel was the dirtiest I've ever been too. Dirty carpet trash around hotel rooms and more dirty carpet extremely smoky even where it is not smoking - even pot smokers in the hotel. Homeless people sleeping near elevators - very poor security - did not feel safe.
10,We landed early enough to get our room and make it to dinner and show reservations (we thought). The room we were given was dirty (unmade beds wet towels laying in the bathroom) and we waited in-line up until our dinner reservation to get the room switched. We ended up having to take our luggage to dinner with us and once we did get into our room we made it to our show with literally minutes to spare. All total it took us several hours to get checked in. Unacceptable.    To be fair the hotel did upgrade us to a better room and the rest of our stay was pleasant.
20,The casino is in a great location but the rooms do not have a fridge microwave or more than 2 pillows. It’s sad because it was so exciting to walk into their beautiful entrance and we were so let down by the service (we asked to be upgraded at our expense and were told even though they had rooms it had been a long day and he didn’t want to work right now). It’s hard to believe we live in a world where that is appropriate to say to a customer. I should have left and gone somewhere else but instead we tried to go to our room and got stuck on an elevator with a broken key box and as soon as we got to our room that was more that 2 football fields away from the elevator the lazy guy at the front desk didn’t program our keys so we had to go all the way back and do it over again with two small children who were exhausted. If you stay here get the upgraded rooms and don’t expect anything luxurious.
30,Our shower didn’t work but we had a schedule of events so after being on hold for 45 min I gave up went to our events came back tired called in the morning only to wait another 45 min. We got moved twice and we were only there for 3 days so that really upset me!
20,The Pool wasn’t open at all the bartender at Diablos inside of the Luxor was rude and perhaps even racist. The card machines in the food court at the Luxor were down and they were accepting cash only.
40,The hotel was very nice. We had a queen double room in one of the towers. Room was spacious and bathroom was very spacious. Comfortable bed and pillows.  Did not gamble but the slot machines looked fun. The food court didn't have many choices however the Excalibur hotel and casino is connected to the Luxor with additional choices. The location of the hotel will deter me from staying there again- it's at the end of the strip. My next stay will be somewhere in the middle of the strip. There are plenty of Ubers available with little wait. Overall the stay was enjoyable and if location is not a factor for you I'd recommend staying here.
10,After staying at the Mandalay Bay Our flight was canceled and we had to book a room for 1 night. The Mandalay Bay room's were triple the rate.The Luxor had a room. It was old and out dated. Never again.
10,Pools are all shut down in 80 degrees no hot water in shower room had no fridge microwave soap had 1 towel and digital keys didn't work for most guests very unclean. Casino is dirty  homeless people outside all over the front. Won't stay here again
10,Got robbed in hotel room while sleeping because the door wouldn’t latch properly after I got robbed security and maintenance came took reports and checked the door the said it was malfunctioning they stole my wallet and gold watch and Luxor dident do a thing about it and after all the reports we missed our flight and had to argue to comp a room because all are money was taken
50,Everyone was helpful and the casino was clean and service was excellent at all of the restaurants and bars. I’d definitely recommend staying here but definitely gaming here due to the cleanliness and care the staff takes in wiping machines down after use.
40,Rooms where nice  Location great  Able to travel through 2 or 3 Casino’s  Plenty places to eat and Shop  Lots of Entertainment  Amenities are very nice  The only problem I had was walls are very thin and I was able to hear EVERYTHING going on in the rooms next to me.
10,i was very unhappy with my experience at the luxor the rooms were both damaged basically and i do not like that i have to pay money for lights to not work in a suite at that matter. no house keeping came until the 4th day like i don’t have towels and sheets to be swapped i was there for 5 days
40,The hotel overall is very nice. The ball was dropped in several areas. We traveled from the east coast to celebrate our anniversary. Our room had to be recleaned and they brought us a broken fridge which we had to get replaced. Housekeeping changed out our towels each day even those we hung to reuse but never made the bed which puzzled us.
40,Fun and nice hotel close to walk to the middle of the strip. The rooms are a little outdated but still comfortable and clean. Easy to get around the hotel with good food super close to Mandalay Bay (both hotels have good night life)
10,Being an MGM property and promoting that they were within walking distance of the new Allegiant Stadium; I would’ve expected the property to be in better condition. Problems from check in to elevators to rooms.
10,All I should say is no shower door. Literally no door water went everywhere. The funniest thing was our bed sheets were upside down and the tag was hitting our faces while sleeping. Not to mention being over charged. Gotta love Vegas. Spend your money elsewhere.
50,Family and friends loved the food and the stay. We’re actually going again in June for my sisters bday very friendly staff I live the pyramid cafe. And the music was great. Rooms were clean and beds were comfortable.
50,I stayed in the east tower and the rooms were nice and clean. The hotel staff was always friendly and the casino had a nice selection of table games and slots. Blackjack was always fun at this casino with reasonable Buy in you would never struggle to find people to play with!
30,Nice hotel overall. Staff is friendly. Casino is nice. We stayed in a pyramid king room. Nice room but the bathroom has some issues. The shower floor is very slippery - slippery enough that I actually fell and stoved up a couple fingers pretty bad and have a nice bruise on my arm. And the shower only has half a door - so the water just splashed everywhere making a heck of a mess. And the parking-even though you’re paying to stay there you still have to pay $15/day for parking there.
30,The pros a decent room and a good experience with the food for breakfast and lunch.  Cons multiple times the elevator wouldn’t not work and it takes forever to get to your room. No dinner buffet just the Mexican restaurant. If I had to do it over again I would of picked somewhere more mainstream where you don’t have to walk forever or get nickeled and dimed by Uber every time you want to go to the main part of the strip.
20,For the price that we paid for the room the size was great. A few downfalls were there were no hooks to hang your wet towels when you were done. Additionally the shower “door” only covered half of the shower resulting in water being everywhere outside of the shower when you were done. Also the bed was a little hard to sleep on and the pillows were very thin and didn’t have much comfort or support. You would have to sleep on 2 pillows to get that head support.
40,"Be sure to understand if your room is located in the pyramid or in the other connected ""towers."" Smoking is allowed in this casino so be warned. The rooms were exceptionally clean but the mattresses were not that comfortable. The staff was helpful and accommodating. The buffet had a lot of options but did seem overpriced for guests. Side note: Nevada taxes people twice to eat. Game offerings were average. Cool factor was still impressive with the shape of the hotel and inner decorations."
50,This hotel's aesthetic is lovely and they are moving forward with digital enhancements to make your experince at Luxor even better. I think this is a great location for checking out what older strip Vegas is like and also see how they are upgrading and changing with time.
50,Luxor is a hidden gem. The location is great. Hotel staff was friendly and professional. The room was nice and clean and looked just like the advertised pictures. This was our first trip to Vegas. We're planning to return in the fall a will definitely stay at Luxor again.
10,"We checked in Sunday at about 3pm while on the check out line a fight broke out between 2 tentative guests. At this point we were about to leave not a good start. We stayed in the West tower every trip to the elevator was filled with rift raft that seemed to have stubbled in from outside without any resistance security was more concerned mask wearing than anything else. At no point did we feel safe walking to the elevator. Almost every time we entered the elevator there were either people acting like they can't find their key or just suspicious people in general. One evening a transgender female got in the elevator with us with blood dripping from his right arm as if he just shot heroin. By the time we left we refused to share an elevator with anyone. As far as the staff or just the shop employees everyone of them was trying to sell us something or trying to get extra tips from us. The Valet told me ""Do you want your car in the front give me a tip now and I will park you in the front"" I would hope this is not the type of behavior you would consider acceptable. We were hassled every time we walked the inside perimeter of the hotel by people trying to sell us show tickets posing as Luxur employees you can not differentiate who worked for who because their ID badges and clothing matched Luxur employees. As far the room housekeeping was very good clean room. The bad would include the TV remote (it didn't work) no coffee pot no refrigerator and although the thermostat was set at 60 he was very warm in the room. All and all we could not wait to leave. We would never enter this hotel ever again it was shameful."
50,Hotel was great I stayed in the pyramid room with 2 queen beds and had a great view. Only thing I didn’t like was in the bathroom it’s slippery in the shower floor I had to put a towel in to keep from falling
10,I won't be back. Room was dirty only 1 wash cloth and an open roll of toilet paper was sitting under the toilet. Floors were filthy. Bed was uncomfortable. No microwave refrigerator or coffee pot! 35.00 per day resort fee for pool which was closed fitness center I wouldn't use during covid and internet. 15.00 per day for self parking only they aren't responsible for damaged or ransacked vehicles! Food was overpriced for example a western omelet 17.00. Coffee was very good. Diablos restaurant had old food salad was brown. Drinks were ridiculously priced at $12.00 per drink and up depending on where you went. The strip herds you around like cattle. Taxis can only be found at each hotel's taxi stand and you walk forever trying to find it.
10,My suite was broken into within 2 hours after checking. Everything points to an employee involved. Over 2K of personal property stolen. Hotel Mgmt didn’t even call or reach out to even offer an apology. I filed a report with security and LVPD so Mgmt had to be aware. I will not come back to the Luxor. Beware you and your property is not safe at the Luxor.
10,Piss stain on sheets that should of been caught while prep room for next guest batteries dead in safe. Elevators are literally falling apart one panel we could pry away and see the shaft as we were moving.
10,half of the room lights did not work poor room layout no designated place to charge devices. The tub's maintenance hatch was falling off the wall. The refrigerator was not cold. The ac had an always on control only. All of this in an corner suite. I would rate this hotel at 2 stars not the 4 claimed.
50,It was an excellent stay. I was very satisfied.. Room was cleaned daily hotel was clean loved the casino. All the staff was so nice and helpful. The price was worth it loved how the pyramid look hotel was really nice
50,The Luxor is iconic and the property is so well maintained. The team works hard to turnover rooms and keep the property clean even with the high amount of foot traffic. My room was excellent the casino floor was cleaned regularly and the food court also did not disappoint!
50,Our overall stay was pleasant our room was comfortable clean & priced right. It was centrally located and contained several quality restaurants for dinner breakfast and all meals in between. Additionally the entrainment was 1st rate
40,We've been to Vegas 30 plus times our first at the Luxor. Had an Elite King Room. It comes with coffee maker and refrigerator. 👍 Room was made up daily. Had a really good time. We'd recommend you try the Luxor at least once. Would we go back definitely.
10,Well since day one of our stay in the Luxor we started seeing problems. The AC didn’t work the entire time of our stay after so many complaints we finally got the engineer to take a look at it after our 2nd night. Also the bathtub which it was the reason why we got a corner room didn’t work and was leaking drops of water all the time basically you couldn’t sleep because of the noise. They never fixed that as well after calling concierge more than 7 times. Honestly this is our worst experience we ever had in a hotel. Never again will visit this place!!!
30,checking. Room was not ready at checkin time and when I did finally get a room it was dirty. When I told the manager at the front desk about everything she said sometimes rooms aren't ready and that can't be helped then said she would comp 1 day of resort fees for the room being dirty.
40,One of the best values on the strip and still a fun place to stay. Good bars great shows places to eat (although could be open later for the night owls like me). Rooms have all been upgraded and probably the best shower head and enclosure I have seen in a hotel in a long time. Lots of power feels great when waking up.
10,I paid for the resort fees and taxes of $241 at the time of booking and then another $238 at check in. Also the loud music in the food court plays 24/7 which can be heard in the rooms above. There are no quiet hours.
20,I’m not happy with my stay and I didn’t sleep well with the stress it caused me. Okay the rooms were not properly cleaned. The drain water when up the shower drain and it smelled very bad. I have never experienced this before anywhere and it sad it had to happen to me an my wife in our anniversary.
50,Very nice rooms  good service  clean  had all amenities . Everything spoken in good clear english . Property was very nice and well taken care of . Only issue was escalators where down most of our stay . Make wifi better it was very shooty
50,"Have been staying at the Luxor for the past several years. Always had great service. Very convenient to walk to Mandalay Bay for convention. Rooms are spacious and clean; bed super comfy and great black out curtains. We get the 2 bedroom suite which includes fridge and coffee machine so makes 8 days in Vegas a little more ""homey"""
40,Mobile check in and room key was excellent never had to worry where our keys were. The entire hotel including our room was very clean and well cared for.    The location of the hotel allows a very quick trip to get to and from the hotel. It’s very easy to walk most of the strip from the hotel itself.    Prices for the amenities are reasonable. We had a good time and recommend Luxor!
50,We had a great time the staff are amazing and the place was immaculate. The skyloft was very spacious with great amenities. The views of the strip were superb. Definitely will be staying here again.
10,Was checked into a dirty room. Not happy pool was closed also. Had to walk to another hotel to swim. That was draining. Overall I would not stay here ever again. Wasn’t worth the cheap price I paid smh
40,We came for a couples trip and to see Garth. While the rooms weren’t fantastic they had some nice updates. We were disappointed that our mini fridges had been removed as we had purchased beer and liquor we wanted to keep cool. We had a great time in casino and the tables staff and pit bosses were great.
20,Definitely not impressed with this hotel. Understaffed for sure and seems generally run down compared to the other hotels. Getting assistance and follow through was rough. I will say though that Blue Man Group was amazing!
30,The elevators are good distances from entrance doors. We stayed there for a wedding and was spread out across the hotel but could not visit with each other bc the key operated the elevator and only allowed entrance to our particular floor. We had to go to bottom floor even to get a visitor from the same plaza/tower
50,I took my parents for their first trip to Vegas and the loved it. The room was clean and well maintained. They enjoyed playing in the casino and enjoyed the breakfast buffet. They will be returning in the later future.
50,Very happy with our stay. Rooms were clean and comfortable. Staff was helpful and courteous. Check in was easy and quick as well as the digital keys. Made out trip simple and enjoyable. Very satisfied
50,This Las Vegas Strip classic still offers nice clean accommodations along with an outstanding location and good variety of restaurant/bar options. Executive casino host Scott Altman is one of the best in town!
50,Went to Vagas for my Wife's birthday and stayed at the Luxor in a pyramid room. The room was clean and had a great view the staff was friendly check in was quick and easy. We will definitely be staying at an MGM property again!
20,Real old hotel on the strip MGM should be ashamed of this property. No mask inforcement. Smoking everywhere dirty and old. Its a Casino that cares only about the money made and dont care avout the hotel guests.
40,Upon arrival we were greated and helped immediately with check in. Staff was friendly and took care us very well. The casino was very nice and had good games to play. Hotel was very cool to look at and the Blue Man group were awsome.
20,We come to Vegas quite a bit and have this hotel before in the tower rooms. If you come stay away from the Parimid rooms not what you thinknyour gonna get. Out dated stuffy needs a total refurbishment from head to toe. You walk inside and you'll feel the darkness the cracks in walls and ceilings the whole place.
50,Great weekend get away! All of luxors staff was friendly and very easy to accommodate us during our stay. Had a blast playing roulette and enjoying some great food at Diablos cantina. Their margaritas are fantastic!
50,Great place to stay and play. We enjoyed our visit and will stay here again. There’s a lot to do right inside the Luxor. No need to go anywhere else - but we did. The rooms are nice and clean. It was a great trip.
50,My partner and I had a fantastic trip to Vegas for our anniversary. Our stay at the Luxor exceeded our expectations. The room was clean and much nicer than we were expecting. Great suite for the price.
20,Long story short staying with the Luxor cost me approximately $1400 instead of the approximate $700 I should’ve paid according to my confirmation. Before checkout and leaving the hotel I spoke with an agent to ensure my account was satisfied in full. Two days later my account was charged an unauthorized additional amount of $700. Upon contacting the hotel and researching the unauthorized amount I was told it would fall off and don’t worry about it. Whaaaaat?!?? What do you mean don’t worry about it????!!! My account is now in the negative because of your negligence and errors in processing these surprise charges!!! Takeaway…stay here if you want to unexpectedly pay double for a grand time in Vegas on the Strip. Im still trying g to get my account straightened…
50,Very helpful staff. Spacious clean and comfortable room. After a long car trip to Vegas it was nice to have a short check in and friendly person. Will stay there again and recommend Luxor to friends.
50,Stayed in tower king. Room was a bit dark but had everything I could ask for. Large shower clean bathroom coffee and very comfortable bed. Luxor is an older property keeping this in mind it’s well taken care of. If you only have a overnight stay this is close to the airport has multiple restaurants including fast food court Blueman Group and other shows and friendly staff.
30,Heather front desk was the highlight of the trip. She made my check-in easy & made sure I had a great room. Tower *East* Rm: 21313  The bathroom had circular water/dirt marks near the toilet. I used Clorox disinfecting wipes to clean the toilet light switches sink THAT FLOOR & all surfaces. There was nothing else I took issue with. The room was spacious and the bedding/towels/washclothes were clean.  However the front desk staff outside of Heather were rude/dismissive & condesending to my friends & other guests. Once voices got raised I noticed they called security QUICK. That is a turnoff bc ppl were not posing a risk to staff's safety. I've stayed at other MGM resorts & they don't do that there. I was fortunate to have a good room but I peep the overall EXPERIENCE & I'll pass. I booked through JetBlue Vacations. Roundtrip no layover flights from JFK to LV 2/6-2/9 for $344. Resort fees paid on check out about $119. I won't be staying at the Luxor again I'll chose another MGM resort.
30,Rooms were a bit outdated. They were clean for the most part. Did not have any issues with any of the staff during my time at the property. I would probably stay here again if I were in the area again. The beds were horrible though. Had to be the most uncomfortable bed I stayed in at a hotel. Too soft and sinking for my liking.
50,I had a great time. Registration Desk was quick friendly and unhurried. Service by housekeeping was great. I called Housekeeping for a blanket and within less than 5 minutes it was delivered. The fast food court had great selections.
50,We loved was an amazing experience. Everything was perfect the food court the rooms de employees. The rooms super clean the beds very comfortable the staff very friendly and make you feel you’re the must important person on the world.
50,Friendly staff at the VIP front desk. They make me come back again because my first time stay there I got a headache and they gave me some foods. Overall I didn't win but the staff make me happy! That's all it matters
10,Need an update elevator rarely work correctly and the staff seem to think their only job is to be there most dealer won’t even talk to you. Digital checkin was a hassle and still had to go to the front desk.
20,I was not happy with the cleanliness the wait at check in or the cost. Resort fees were ridiculous. I had to switch rooms because my room wasn't clean. My card was also charged 5 separate times and I was not told that this was going to happen.
50,You will be seeing me again ❤️ ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
40,The elevators should be updated because you have to use your room key card to go to your floor and sometimes it didn't work and that was so frustrating and the rooms don't have microwave and if you go out to dinner and bring food back you can't warm it up and it doesn't have a refrigerator
30,First time in Vegas. The hotel impressive to look at. Room was nice. On my 4 day stay they did not have house keeping service for my room on 3rd day. The hotel has a smokey odor to it. The rooms were not smoky smelling but you had to walk through it. I like the access to the other hotels and the many choices . I had a nice view from my window
20,They charge resort fees then when you get there they charge a $15 if they a day parking fee on top of that. Stayed a week. Come back every year for birthday celebration. Will not be staying  at Luxor again.😠
50,Great rooms !! Awesome games !! Amazing staff !!  Had a great time playing all the new slots. Drinks are great! Loving that back stage deli for those late night cravings . I definitely recommend staying at Luxor .
10,This is a very outdated casino on the strip. Many better options exist. The staff seems bothered to be there. The slot machines have their super bonus disabled. This is clearly a struggling property that is focused on the meager bottom line rather than providing experiences that are memorable for its guests. Choose Bellagio Caesars hell- even the Flamingo may provide a better experience than this “resort”.
10,Service was awful . Got overcharged more than one time and never got my room cleaned. Was there for a week . Elevators kept getting stuck . I had 3 separate rooms . Every night my mothers key card would not work . Rooms were filthy . Housekeeping couldn’t speak English so she couldn’t comprehend to clean the room. Don’t have a disability they gave you the furthest room from anything and anywhere. Valet workers made sure you knew they worked off of tips. All over experience this time was bad . Was in Vegas a month ago and stayed at the MGM it was better than the Luxor
20,Over promised and under delivered. Rooms were given a curtesy upgrade when we checked in but it was more of a downgrade. We reserved the kinds of rooms we did for a specific reason. So that was disappointing.Then they had to send a tech to our room twice to fix the heat (cold air wouldn't stop blowing from vents) and the tv which didn't come until the next day so my family slept with coats on the first night. Ordered $70 worth of Starbucks and the lady piled everything on the counter expecting me to be able to carry all the food and drinks. I asked for a bag and it was thrown on top of the pile of food and was gestured to pack up my own things which I did. I'm an MGM member and courtesy parking comes as a benefit but it didn't work when we arrived so we ended up paying valet the first night and it worked the rest of the time we were there and when we checked out it didn't so we ended up paying again. I was so disappointed because I heard from a few people that this hotel was great. When I told them about my experience they were shocked.
50,Great location love the ability to walk between hotels without even stepping outside. great selection of fun slot machines to choose from. Loved the huge breakfast buffet with mouth watering options. The filet mignon and mashed potato at Tender Steak House was to die for. I would highly recommend the Luxor to anyone.
50,East west coast game Trip the bus scene was great I like the convenience of the hotel  I wish the restaurants were all open but the restaurants that were open for very good we would come again hopefully they do it next year
50,The room was very clean the view was amazing I enjoyed my stay! Stayed up all night the food was so good! You can take the shuttle to Excalibur to get on the strip. I don’t really have any complaints.
10,The room was hands down terrible . Will never stay here again . Just because a hotel is by MGM doesn’t mean it’s going to be good . I had a better time staying at the Berkeley Hotel at the Silverton . The experience was so bad at the Luxor Hotel  that I checked out a day early and will never go back .
50,Very clean hotel all the staff were beyond friendly and helpful. Checking in I got a free upgrade and was allowed to check in early. The rooms were very cozy and clean and the bed comfy! I will definitely be staying here every time!
40,Best location to go see something at Raiders Stadium. My wife was not as big a fan as me but it was a lovely and somewhat affordable experience. Eat at the pyramid cafe. The bbq burger was amazing. Staff was nice but do mobile check the morning you are checking in. Drove from LA and was going to mobile checkin when I arrived but after midnight you have to check in at the desk and it took an hour.
20,No microwave or refrigerator. Staff was unprofessional and housekeeping will enter your room regardless if you want them to or not. I understand resort fees but pool and other amenities were not available. Would not recommend.
50,Our experience was for the most part a good one. The rooms were clean and quiet. The many options for dining facilities were clean kid friendly and the food was good quality. The staff that we did encounter were courteous and helpful. I would stay there again.
10,Cheap well tequila in top brand bottles. I know cuz I have a tequila bar!! Maids didn’t stock coffee & cups daily. Pillows were lumpy & very uncomfortable. The smoke in the casino was awful!! Poor ventilation-gambled elsewhere. Park MGM was smoke free & awesome!!
50,I stayed in the pyramid area last October 2021. I think it was room 122 so not high up. It was an incredible experience the food is good blue man group I highly recommend. But what really stood out for me was the paranormal activity I experienced the first night. I didn’t know when I was there that it was a hotspot until after when i looked into my experience. If that kind of thing bothers you. Make sure you unplug every electronic device while you stay there before you go to sleep. Especially the TV.
50,Nice room overall. Bed was comfortable and there was plenty of space.The tub faucet leaked when filling the tub at full blast and it took a long time for the AC to cool the room. only 2-slight negatives for an overall great room.
10,Electronic check in process did not work at all!!! I had to log all my stuff back-and-forth from the elevator to reservations for separate times to try to be able to get into my room…  When I tried to book 2 tickets into America’s Got Talent I was put on hold nine separate times and had to wait 40 minutes before they were finally able to secure me two tickets……  That is absolutely freaking ridiculous!!
40,I had never stayed at Luxor before but was going to Pro Bowl and wanted the convenience of the Stadium Walk. Mobile check-in was a breeze printed my own key and off I went...ZERO waiting in line. I was in Tower East. It was clean great view and most of all quiet! Spacious bathroom and love that it was a walk in shower. Casino machines were a little selfish but good variety of games. Ate at Public House after the game...decent fast big portions. Ladies working in the 24/7 store were all very friendly and helpful. All in all I would stay here again.
30,My stay was okay. There were maintenance issues with the television and a broken light switch. I also found a can of chew under the desk and the sink seemed to be dirty which made me doubt the room was cleaned.
10,Stained room and then the run around… lot more to it I’m just not big on reviews. It wasn’t good. I don’t look forward to returning if it’s going to be like that or anything close. Last thing you need is to pay for a headache in Las Vegas.
20,Do not stay here they have bed bugs and the house keepers have horrible attitudes. I woke up with bites from bed bugs!! The location is great but I would not recommend unless it is your last resort!!
20,The room was average but most of the staff was friendly and cordial. The check-in and check-out were horrible and I still have a charge on my account and no notice as to what the charge is for. We spent 45 minutes checking in and an hour trying to check out with an incompetent registration staff.
50,Took my family on vacation here and it was a very neat experience to stay in the pyramid. The kids loved it and it had a great atmosphere. Elevators were hit and miss but overall I would stay here again.
50,Mariana and Cassidy are the reason why I will return to Luxor Casino and Hotel. Mariana and Cassidy work at the front desk. They greeted me when I arrived. They provided me with information needed. They are very professional and kind. They made me feel like I was at home. Mariana and Cassidy are an asset to the Luxor Casino and Hotel.
50,Everything about our stay was perfect. The room the view the service the cleanliness of the hotel the price the restaurants the staff the casino even other guests seemed to radiate feel good energy during our stay. Nothing went wrong everything was flawless.
20,"It started when they bait and switched my room. All I wanted for my stay in Vegas was a hot tub room that's it. I compared all hotels with this feature and decided on the Luxor for it's location to the stadium. The room of course did not have one and when I asked for a room with a tub was told there was none and they were sorry. That's called a bait and switch and it's highly illegal. The pipes in the bathroom were so loud I could not sleep. the first night I actually thought a group of kids was walking the hall banging on pots and pans it was that loud. Every single night 2-3 times the same noise. Not a single good night sleep. The key system is atrocious you have to use your key to access your floor and more than half of the time it just did not work then the same issue with the door keys. Every day  same thing get in the elevator and you have to try 5-6 times just to push the floor button same thing when you get to your room the light turns green but the door just doesn't open it became a running joke. The $100 ""resort"" fee is straight out extortion and lastly they billed me an additional $300 after check out even though I supposedly paid the entire amount in advance charge back pending. In short stay somewhere else. there are 100+ hotels in this town this one is not recommended by this regular traveler for anyone. There's a reason they advertise $20 rooms it's about what you would expect from a cheap roadside hotel."
40,Nice staff room was dated (king pyramid) and no hi-def TV. Channels were grainy. Also no USB ports for charging. Fixed issue of no hot water in shower quickly. No loud noise and bed was comfortable. Super close to Allegiant Stadium.
30,The rooms were more comfortable than we expected. The staff were mostly unfriendly and unhelpful (with the exception of the check in desk). There are so many outstanding properties in Vegas that I don't think I would choose to stay here again.
40,We really enjoyed our stay at the Luxor. Staff was great entertainment was great and a lot of other great things to do that were very close by. Great shuttles to the game and other event. The only complaint that we could even make was that our room did not get room service one of the days we were there. Overall a great time was had
40,Super price room could have been cleaner but excellent to rest your head just a tad too far down the end of the strip for me mostly. Excellent staff though. Can’t beat price. Getting outdated and most likely need updates soon.
20,Noisy and expensive outdated room. TV doesn't work and leaky shower head. The tiles in the bathroom looks dirty and broken. Should have a refrigerator and at least some free coffee or water in each room.
50,Room was great lots of space very clean.  Was loud in the morning noise woke us up.  Problems with parking hard to find parking space and problems with gate opening. Customer service line very long and long wait to get someone to help us.
50,Great all around casino resort will be going back in December great staff in all departments great slots and great food there are great shows all so it’s on the south end of the strip and not any problems
20,When we got in our room smelled a little like smoke. I went to shower and the water wouldn’t get hot. We tried to connect to the tv because there was no other way to listen to music and the volume didn’t work.. well it did if you wanted to watch adult movies which we did not. The room also offered no fridge which I thought was kind of strange.. not the greatest experience wouldn’t book again.
40,Luxor is the best place to stay at with a reasonable price if your going to an event at Allegiant. It's about a 10 min walk out the back parking lot and over the bridge. It would be great if Luxor guests did not have to pay for parking
30,Stuck in elevator for 45 minutes. West tower. Pretty much ruined our night. Not even an apology from hotel management. Tenders steakhouse onsite is really excellent. Mobile check in is a quick and convenient option.
10,Place was horrible. Elevators shocked me every time I pressed a button and they kept shaking nonstop. The room itself had a messed up AC to where the heat wouldn’t work. Shower only had one door so you couldn’t even close it. No body wash provided at all. Water pressure in shower was way too high so the shower itself overfilled with every use since it wasn’t draining fast enough. TV very out of date with minimal channels. Restaurants we’re overpriced and quality of food didn’t come even close to the price. Checking into the hotel took almost 2 hours when I was told checkout was at 3pm. Rags and towels were rough. Overall horrible experience and wouldn’t recommend to anybody
20,Your better off staying at a motel 6 or something like that. One it will be cheaper and two it's the same quality. So don't waste your money here stay at a better resort. Maybe ballys or some Ceasars property. Seems like they care about there properties.
10,Rooms smell like smoke hotel very outdated service was horrible some of the staff rude. Elevators are outdated don’t work with new technology got stuck several times so if you have to wait for someone to hit button don’t use the app!!!
10,If you like broken meth pipes left in front of your room and random people smoking in the hallways while basic hotel appliances break pm you you will love this place. Had to tell the staff twice to pick up the meth pipe. The shower head broke and rocketed into my head while I was showering. There's no refrigerator just a huge empty cabinet space. And being on the casino floor was super sketch with random people walking around looking for a secret place to smoke.
20,After walking miles on the Las Vegas strip and drinking all day you just want to be able to crash in a comfortable bed. Unfortunately the bed (in a premier room) was very hard. The pillows were old. For staying somewhere for the night I would have rather paid less for the bed. Everything else was great we loved the locations of the Luxor and had fun in the casino but 3 nights on that bed was horrible.
10,The staff is rude to people about masks. We did not get the stay fresh room that we paid for nor were they willing to make it right. The refrigerator was dirty and full of someone else's things in it. We paid for a week stay in a corner suite we will not be returning to the Luxor again.
10,Hotel is very run down with multiple broken moving walkways that were clearly just abandoned as nobody touched them for at least 5 consecutive days multiple closed restaurants which limited dining zero enforcement of the mask policy pathetic sports book viewing area inconvenient distance between cab drop off location and East/West towers (cabs are not allowed to drop off at tower entrances) overpriced resort fee (why is the resort fee the same at Luxor as it is at places with much higher standard of resort maintenance and feel and offerings such as the Cosmopolitan?). Overall while on the cheaper side of strip costs the Luxor’s distance to anywhere you would want to spend time eliminated that “value” and made all the guests we stayed with deem this property no longer worth visiting anymore and this place should probably destroyed at this point.
30,Good stay if you are attending a convention at Mandalay Bay and are looking for an economical and convenient option. You can walk through the shops at Mandalay and never have to set foot outside. The hotel itself is tired though but is clean and does the job!
30,Be careful It’s all a bit outdated . The elevator needs servicing it will shock you a few times I hope your tub works mine was just for looks . I might stay again In a higher floor to see if their nicer up there.
10,I knew we were in trouble as we pull up and the security guy said they only have 1 guy at bell service. He had no clue on how we check in. After driving around the building for an hour because the signs for self parking leads you to the wrong hotel. We did the self check in and the app didn’t work. Now to the fron desk for keys. We get to the room and it’s not ready. Garbage all over. Used condoms laid around. It was a mess. They promised to put our wedding party together and straight up lied. The customer is never right at this place.
30,Like other places short staffed. Front desk took 15 min to answer calls. But staff was very friendly and helpful. Elevators were frightening. Rooms were very clean but did not have a mini-fridge or microwave.
10,Flooded bathroom noisy aircon and exorbitant (hidden) resort fees. Repair of bathroom and aircon took almost a day to be fixed. Checking-in tired and faced with paying resort fees in advance was like blackmail.
10,my stay at the Luxor was terrible. my linen was dirty as well as my sheets. the room was outdated for the money I spent for my stay would compare this hotel to motel 6. house keeping was not the friendlies. asking house keepers for clean linen was like asking yourself. poor customer service. HORRIBLE WILL NOT RECOMMEND !!
20,Very dirty  drunks passed out on floor on main walk way not a good place to have kids with for sure .offer in room food service then don't. No one answers front desk. Thanks only a couple people at front desk
10,Had 3 different rooms on my 4 day stay. The first room reeked of cigarette smoke and a musty odor. Second room was filthy. Third room was still musty and smelled of cigarettes but was a bit cleaner than the other two rooms. I went to nearest store and bought cleaning supplies to clean and santiize my room. The pyramid rooms are way overdue a major remodel. From the popcorn ceilings to the half door showers. The common areas near the elevators and the actual elevators are extremely overdue a thorough cleaning and update. Its a shame... The hotel is unique and could have been a much nicer experience.
10,The young lady at the front desk was very rude. Told me they sold the room I actually purchased and they would give me another one and if I didn’t like it I could stay somewhere else. It was a rough hour at check in.
40,I enjoyed my stay at the Luxor. Great staff that were very nice and helpful. Could use more lighting though out the property though very dark indoors.. The rooms are decent but the shower will get the entire bathroom floor soaked. Great place though.
20,Fair priced hotel. Good location. Great for a short stay in Las Vegas. Not far from the main LV strip. Offers a buffet everyday reasonably priced. The hotel staff could be a little more friendly. Mask policy not strictly enforced throughout the hotel. Many patrons were without masks.
40,nice hotel and good location  annoying that the key cards only allow access to your floor. i had family staying here as well under my reservation and i could not go to their floor without getting a separate key card
20,HARRAHS or Linq is a better choice. Very outdated. Casino needs to be updated as well as the rooms.    Our friends are staying here in April and we have already warned them. We won’t be staying here again.
30,I was in a “recently renovated” room but it didn’t have a refrigerator. There were only 3 average size pillows for a king size bed. The fan in the bathroom was extremely loud. We had the temperature set at 67 but it was still hot. I couldn’t get a players card because the line was always very long
50,I stayed here on a quick Wed. - Sat trip for our industry convention held at Mandalay Bay. I chose Luxor because it was cheaper than Mandalay Bay. I stayed in a King suite in the Pyramid the room was really nice. The Luxor sometimes gets a bad rap for the rooms but mine was pretty up to date and nice.
50,For first time there couldn't ask for more luxury room great price show tickets equal to quality of the facility plenty to do besides enjoy your luxury room food courts has great then theres also a connection to other casinos thats very convenient
30,I had 3 rooms. Rooms were dirty and had bad cigarette smell mold in the bathroom bathroom door wouldn’t close. Half pane In the bathroom sucks and water gets all over the floor. Housekeeping walked in as they were knocking.
20,Management terrible loud banging in hallway/next door stayed in a tower room and seemed to have construction going on. Also payed a resort fee for pool not to be open. Came for my birthday for the first time to Vegas and was totally unhappy
20,I didn’t have high expectations at the price point but I did expect to receive the items I requested from housekeeping in a timely manner. I was ignored unless I called multiple times. The hotel was great to stay at because I was traveling with my kids. The lobby was extremely crowded at times with minimal mask wearer’s.
30,This hotel is ok.. Good for the money. Better signs for the Monorail  And such. Descent value for the money. Had a lack of hot water in the evenings. Didn’t eat at any of the restaurants there. Cool design
30,MGM fails me MGM resorts send you three emails a day a check in all telling you to use the keyless system you get there and it doesn’t work the bed on one side was at least 2 inches lower than the other side of the rolling you either rolled off the bed or cannot roll the other direction they advertise free parking when your pearl member which is not true because I had to pay for parking
50,Stayed here for My daughters 21st Bday Overall great hotel starbucks had really limited hours Really clean rooms Lots of choices in food Too cold to Use pools but looked beautiful .  rooms super easy to acess
50,Great place to stay would recommend to anyone service was great they were good on early check in and all staff was very frendley and helped with anything we needed will stay there again next time I’m in vegas
50,The rooms are tinted so light pollution is no issue here. You can sleep in with the shades closed or see a bit of twinkling night light depending on which side you face. Facing away from strip is peaceful and there are mirrors in all the design concept. I believe this place is very good for those who enjoy going out of their rooms at night because the whole hotel doesn't really open until 5pm-2am! The esports arena is behind a lovely internet arcade with industry standard keyboards comfortable gaming chairs and next to a Wonderful pub called Public House. The rooms are non smoking and the sports booking area is as well. Masks are required indoors. Using cannabis is illegal on any casino grounds and you will be find for use of any type of vapor cannabis smoking in your room. There is a deposit for your room and $35 a day resort fee. As rooms are concerned this is the best value for older casinos as it gets. This resort is very friendly to lqbtqia+ community especially in summer on Sundays. Check the pool for details.
20,The room was not what was promised in the reservation photo; the Hampton Inn did a better of providing amenities; no coffee maker no refrigerator & very limited on toiletries. Looks like the Luxor was attempting to save money.
50,Was unable to book a suite online but front desk made it happen! Clean rooms great service and friendly staff. Great food. Diablo Cantina and Pyramid Cafe were some of the best quality of food we've had in our many travels. Overall an excellent stay and would highly recommend to anyone!
50,Great trip first time in Vegas and it was 🔥 . Great Experience it was my 50th birthday and I partied like a rock star. Gamble a little bit Had me some drinks and walked the strip. I really enjoyed myself until next time.
40,recently stayed at the Luxor for the east west shrine bowl. It was overall a great experience. The staff was helpful and provided good service. The room was clean. The only thing missing was a Keurig coffee pot which has become a staple in most hotel rooms. The room service was as needed but when called was very accommodating. I would definitely recommend in Luxor for its location to the sports venues and the airport.
50,Excellent Venue and location. Hotel very clean and up keep. Casino was the same. The buffet food selection was good and hostess where very nice. Ground transportation was readily available. I would recommend to family and friends.
50,Our flight arrived 8am Vegas time and we were allowed to check in earlier than our 3pm check in for no additional cost! The staff was friendly clean room we didn’t get a hand bar soap so we had to buy one but everything else was good!
10,Better to just avoid....so many better options on Caesar's properties ...long lines...Expensive parking charges for guests... cheesy bathroom and shower for a corner premiere queen suite...light bulbs burnt out...pot smoking in the corridors...zero security...
10,In Vegas for a tradeshow. We booked a 2 bed corner suite assuming it would be nice and a little more space. Our room smelled terrible and was dirty. Dust on the glass table you can see in photos we took. Staff was unfriendly. Not worth the competitive rate for the filth.
50,A very good experience with interesting elevators. The buffet did lack quality food and mimosas but service was good as well as some of the food we ate The shows offered spectacular though we not have time to see any at LUXOR.
10,Definitely not worth the price. Bathrooms old corroded moldy and weren’t cleaned well. I could never get front desk on the phone. Definitely won’t come back to this property. Mandalas Bay was a lot better.
40,We spent a week at the Luxor it was great for the most part would’ve been better if we didn’t go without water for so long and that the heat worked in our room other than that our stay was good. We had lots of fun
50,Hotel was beautiful and the service desk was wonderful. Easy check in and out. Restaurant had great food and service. There on business so did not have time for show or exhibit but would have liked to.
40,It will be very nice once all the rooms are updated. The first couple of nights we were in an older room. The next few nights in a renovated room - very nice. The staff (everyone) were exceptional. Easy walk to the Mandalay Bay to go swimming with the grandkids in a heated pool.
40,It's showing it's age but cost and location is what i liked. Very easy to walk to neighboring properties and the mono rail. No coffee machine in the room was a bit strange. great view from the top floors of the Pyramid rooms.
50,Sleeping at the luxor was an incredible ex The elevator ride at a 39ﾟ angle was also spectacular as well as the view and and the shape of the hotel. There was always something to do the food court the casino and the shops were very enjoyable. We will definitely be going back.
50,Beautiful Hotel with easy parking friendly staff great food and very nice rooms. Excellent value!! Great value and very good location with easy access to neighboring Hotels. Highly reccommend for the price!!!
20,My score is based on my business travel experience. I would never stay here on my own dime. You might as well stay in a Motel 6 across the street. The advantage is there is a casino downstairs. The rooms are old and run down. My company reserved the room and probably didn't pay much so keep that in mind. We probably got what we paid for.
50,Great place for family trip. Staying with check in. The only thing I feel there should be more people working the desk. I usually arrive pretty late and there is only one person helping guests. Would definitely stay there again.
30,Rooms were out of date and gloomy inside. The ceiling of my room 7070 had some sort of damage as if it was peeling off. The room was more pricy and the casino decor is gloomy. The bed was great hone hot gets a face lift.
10,"We had to check in late at 2 AM in the morning the the guy who was at the desk try to put me and my wife into a suite that we did not book ...we booked the corner suite with the hot tub and he put us in a regular suite and didn't say anything. So of course I'm irritated because again it's 2 AM in the morning I had to go down there and tell him that was the wrong room ...and then he said oh well that room is not available until tomorrow and I said ""how come you didn't tell me that when I 1st came to the counter???"" ... He said he did not know that it was supposed to be a corner suite.. Like come on really it doesn't say in the computer which one I'm supposed to get... so you just put people in random suits ...that makes no sense!!! We had to switch rooms the next day which was an inconvenience. They took off the resort fees but that was only after I went back down and complained. Had I never complained they would have been OK with putting me in the Is cheaper suit. This guy actually was hoping I was dumb I guess. And if a manager told him to do that (he disappeared to the back for a few minutes before he gave us the wrong room) that manager is to blame as well! They knew exactly what they were trying to pull!"
40,"Almost perfect. Was a little disappointed that since masks are required no one monitored them. I know it's impossible to get patrons to comply 100% but it's not a good sign when I saw some employees either not wearing a mask or having it pulled down. And seeing employees not telling patrons to wear their masks and/or wear them correctly when they do see improper use. A far cry better than my last experience. I swore never to be back but after ""calming down"" I realized it was my only bad (and it was very bad) experience in all the times I've stayed there which have all been 5 Star previously. So other than the mask issue they did totally redeem themselves and I'll come back yet again."
40,Best place to stay for the value. Not on the busy part of the strip but all resorts can be reached with ease using the tram. Great bars and the casino seems to pay out the best of all on the strip. Drinks on the casino floor are plenty. Enjoyed Excalibur and Mandalay Bay being connected to the Luxor. You really can't go wrong with this place
40,This was a spur of the moment decision to get a hotel room. The front desk staff was friendly and have great customer service. I was shocked when I got to my room it was better than I expected. Clean spacious and comfortable.
50,Very nice and centrally located to where our conference was at Mandalay Bay the two hotels are connected So it was a fraction of the cost but same service! Will definitely be back for the staff and people from valet to check in to room service
50,It was a great experience staying at Luxor great service and the room was perfect. Employees were nice and helpful. The cafe restaurant have a great food. The room was clean and comfortable. This hotel is better than Excalibur I used to staid at Excalibur but not anymore. Luxor is a great place to stay it was my fist experience at Luxor.
50,His name was Robert and the girl that was working beside him(21-23) I didn’t get her name; at Reservation we’re the best. Made our stay the most satisfying of all time! They make us want to come back- nothing else comes close.
40,Checked in with mobile app. Only problem was I still needed keys so had to wait in line anyway.  There was no tub only a shower. And no mini fridge. The price I paid was great until you add resort fees with no resort amenities.  Loved how I could just walk to the other hotels.
50,We were surprised to find the Luxor not terribly crowded clean and the rooms very comfortable. It was easy to get to Mandalay Bay and Excalibur without even going outside.most people were wearing masks and hand sanitizers and masks were readily available.
50,One of my favorite places to visit hotel room upgraded to one of the towers and was clean. not a bad walking distance from OYO MGM Tropicana Mandalay Bay and Excalibur. If you like the ancient Egypt theme this is for you
50,All as expected. Good food and close to the work event. We stayed 9 nights and 3 of those days was work related. We gambled and found the gambling to be a fair as the gaming in several of the other sites we visited. We also like that the motel was connected to several of our other favorite ones to visit. The entertainment shows in The Luxor was not as high of caliber as some but they are worth going to see. and well priced. Hope to get an invite to visit again soon.
10,Dirty rooms. Bring a black light. When we checked in the tub and shower was already full of pubic hair from the previous guest so not sure they’re cleaning process. The bedding was dirty and stained. Enjoy
50,My wife and I recently stayed at the Luxor in Las Vegas while I was attending a U.S. Marine Corps Reunion with my fellow Marines from Desert Shield/Desert Storm. The Hotel was wonderful from the time we pulled up to the Valet check-in process and a wonderful Hotel room that was comfortable air controlled and had a view of the Strip. The Hotel restaurants were fantastic service great and overall we gave our stay 5 Stars out of 5 Stars and 2 Thumbs up WAY UP! Thanks Luxor will recommend you to our closest friends!
50,My husband and I have been to most of the hotels on the strip and every time we are upset we didn’t just get a room at Luxor. It’s our favorite. The customer service alone is enough but it’s just a bonus.
30,The shower head flooded the floor of the bathroom as there is no door or shower curtain in the shower . Used every towel we had to mop up the water so we could use the bathroom . Housekeeping's answer was to point the shower head tword the wall away from the entrance . This makes taking a shower impossible . Also there is no security latch on the entrance door to the room .
50,My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our first-time stay at the Luxor for his birthday weekend. Although the line to wait in for check-in was a little longer than we wanted after a long day of travel everything else was top-notch. We can't wait to come back!
10,Almost none of the escalators worked. When I asked the staff for help with my 7 pieces of luggages going up or down the broken escalators I was given no help and broke over 100$ worth of items.The direction signage for how to get around the hotel was horrible and almost everything was broken.
40,Used rewards points to reserve a complimentary stay and the check in was very easy. The room was very comfortable as well. I only wished that the room had a fridge. The view from the room was expected so I couldn't be upset about that.
20,First room had a large wet stain on the carpet. Got switched to another room but AC didn’t work and the pipes got clogged. Didn’t know there was a resort fee when I booked it but May have overlooked it. Most amenities were closed due to “staff shortage”. It’s not a staff shortage; employers refusing to pay living wages is not a staff shortage.
50,My wife and I had a very good experience at Luxor Hotel & Casino. All staff were very friendly and helpful starting from when we arrive early checkin with front desk was simple and easy room service and all the staff were great.
20,Advertised as recently renovated. Parts may have been recently renovated but many parts were not. 30+ year old HVAC system in room were very noisy & dirty. Room cleanliness & amenities were not good. No USB phone charger coffee pot or Hair dryer. Caveat Emptor.
40,Hotel staff was great location was amazing. There were a few areas in the hotel not taken care of too good but overall very good.  Walking distance to the strip and the ATT arena since I had a concert to attend so very well located .
40,The stay was good Starbucks needs to be open all day. Staff is friendly. Rooms need to be remodeled. The elevator shakes too much that it's even weird. Over all it was ok for the time that I was there.
10,MGM properties are the worst they charge one of the highest resort fees then charge there guests $15 to park your car or $30 for valet parking. The rooms are outdated and are in serious need of remodeling
20,The hotel was cool on the inside seeing the pyramid and the sculptures inside. My main concern is that the rooms weren’t very clean. If you weren’t out of your room by 9:30 your room wasn’t getting cleaned for the day. Also there were bobby-pins all over the floor and even when I was out in time for the room to be cleaned the bobby-pins stayed right where they were. Also getting towels was an issue and we ran out of toilet paper at one point. I won’t stay in this hotel again.
30,From what I've heard the pyramid part of the hotel is quite run down and dirty. We stayed in the West Tower and it was clean and quiet. Overall it was a good stay. The room did not smell of cigarette smoke. The staff is constantly trying to upsell you and get you to check out another MGM hotel in Vegas in return they will give you vouchers for stuff. When we asked how long we could expect to be there at their presentation they said anywhere from 90 minutes to FOUR HOURS. No. I did not come to Vegas to be harassed by staff and listen to a pitch about a timeshare. Other than that however the staff were all very friendly. The Luxor is a great location. Close to a lot of shopping and other casinos. The casino area was always clean. We didn't eat at the Luxor so I can't comment on the restaurants.
10,It’s not worth it. The hotel looks nice on the outside but that’s about it this review has to be 200 words so But there isn’t much more to talk about the hotel is not worth the price and is not better than the other options on the strip
30,Soaked carpet leading to my room on 2nd floor almost causing me to bust my tail. There was a caution sign. Great! I assumed it'll be taken care of. It wasn't my entire 3 nights. The 4th floor same location. Same. Disappointing
40,Rooms are very clean we were never bothered. Safe in the room was nice. Ice and soda on our floor was nice. And cheaper than in lobby. No fridge was a bummer. Location is OK. Had to walk or Lyft to get most places. Free tram to next hotel was a benefit. Clean casino. Had to wait 20 minutes to check in at midnight (2am my time.)
10,Room smelled musty the entire weekend! Considering we only in the room a few hours to sleep we didn’t want to be inconvenienced with having to move to another room. Housekeeping should really pay attention to these things and rooms should not be issued to customers in these conditions.
40,I've always heard rumors that it was a little run down but I was really fairly shocked by how nice the room was for the price. Had a great time on the casino floor drink ladies came around fairly often.
50,You will not be disappointed! Luxor has been one of my ALL time favorites! The just keep getting better and better. No place is perfect and I can say I’ve had a few hiccups before but overall it is the BEST to me.
40,It's been a while since I stayed at the Luxor. It was clean and friendly. Nice rooms. The only poor review is the check in process. I felt I was in a line of snails. Could be short staff however I remember the same problem before covid.
20,Guest service is poor takes forever to check in them they don’t even give you they type of room you reserved. Then try to tell you the tower rooms are an upgrade. The tower rooms are horrible. Never got medical refrigerator that was needed and had to move rooms 3 times.
40,Nice hotel with great amenities.. but it was tough to navigate nothing was open after 11pm.. as for the room the bathroom didnt seem like it was cleaned fully and the hot water lasted about 5 minutes.
20,Stay at the Luxor because I have never stayed and always wanted to stay in the pyramid. When I arrived I was offered an upgrade because it was my birthday. When I got to my room I instantly had an allergic reaction because of all the dust that was in the room. When you looked around you could tell that they were barely cleaning. There was a collection of dust on one of the sprinklers in the room. The bathroom pipes were terrible. When you flushed the toilet water would splash all over the place. The water in the sink would take forever to go down. The beds were not comfortable at all! It felt like you were sleeping on a cardboard mattress. I was not happy with my stay and will not be back.
50,The View was so nice the check-in was not cool the mobile app was over all it was pretty nice money well spent we park all over was good so we didn't drive around for hours the luxor hand down was a great pick
50,The room was CLEAN spacious & modern decor. It did not have a refrigerator or microwave the suites only have them now. I wish I had known that before hand but Always come prepared. The Front desk Staff was VERY pleasant. Ask for Cleo! She gave great restaurant options 3 in order of price range. I loved that part. She wrote in it our key info. She gave excellent directions to self-park it’s kinda tricky if you aren’t in an Uber. Even the housekeeping staff was super helpful delightful & conversational. They assisted as much as possible without having to be asked. The food was good often when ppl come to Vegas they don’t like the food. The Luxor did amazing. Even the keeping the free drinks coming while we were in the casino. They kept the ashtrays clean and the bathrooms were clean clean especially during this time.
10,Room had everything broken. Nothing seemed to work properly. Waited 5 hours for tvs to be repaired. AC/heater was broken so we had a very cold weekend. Room very outdated. Room had power strips something i had never seen before not even at Circus Circus. Wow.
10,Luxor stay I was a honestly bummed out I had to score it this. We got to our room and someone’s clothes were in there also there were stains all over the pillow we asked to have something be done and it took them a while I called the front desk and they just called to check that they were coming to change the sheets. Then someone left there purse in our room. I just wish maybe that we could have gotten a different room or compt or something.
20,My trip was not great. The Pyramid Room I was in (21st-22nd) was horrible. Everything was outdated-old dusty & rusty; calcium & lime encrusted b/r fixtures just a mess. Not worth the price I paid. Water pressure sucked & needs an upgrade. TV wouldn't display FireStick either. Changed to tower room #2321 (for 22nd-27th). Walked in room reeked of cigarette smoke. Asked maid in hallway for air freshener but never got any. Discovered the smoke detector was covered with a plastic bag so whoever was in the room before me went to great lengths to not get caught. I can't stand smoking & people who can't follow simple rules. Smoking shouldn't be allowed in casinos at all in any area. Since maid was a no-show tried calling down but no success-line just rang. Forgot to inform the front desk too. Turned on the air conditioner (wishing I could open up a window) but it didn't help much. Just kept the air up to mask the smell. It even smelled like cig smoke in the hallway at times. Just terrible. Very displeased with the overall experience I had. The staff (for the most part) was nice & friendly. Needed firmer fluffier pillows on the beds. They get flat real quick. The resort fee & tax were very unnecessary due to the fact that almost everything was closed. Why pay a fee if you can't enjoy any of the perks?!? Money wasted for sure if you ask me. The rooms look better in ads than in real life. These casinos need to step their game up if they want to get good feedback from people...
10,The elevators are a pain to use. It doesn’t matter what floor you select it will take you where it wants. The hotel stinks. The room was hot and air would only stay on for about ten minutes then the whole system would shut off by itself. The toilet wouldn’t flush and shower backed up every time it was used. And there is no fridge in the room.
40,Everything was great! We are M Life members and had a discounted stay. We stayed in the corner suite in the pyramid. Everything was clean service was good the slot credit didn’t last long the resort credit was unusable. No place we visited that was listed as participating would honor it. Disappointing. But overall a great stay. We brought out 19mo old. We technically stopped for a couple nights on our drive from Indiana to San Fran. Our baby loved the lights and the area was quiet and she slept a well. Loved the huge clover shaped tub. She was in heaven.
30,Went for a girls trip overall we had a good time in Vegas. Hotel location isn’t proximal on the strip but if you don’t mind walking a bit more for the value this may be your cup of tea. Casino area at night was very lively on Saturday night with a variety of music.
40,staff was GREAT plenty of affordable food choices inside the casino & around Hussongs Cantina is definitely a place worth visiting while there. entertainment choices inside as well and the staff knows what to recommend should you need some suggestions.
50,Room was clean and staff was super helpful own thing was bad was buying soda are water was high price in side the casino but on the strip was cheaper but it was a lot of eating places and things to do in the casino
30,Just don’t rely on them helping you if you experience problems. All problems are your fault. Room was okay AC barely worked. But slept great because of tequila. Don’t use mobile check in they told me my digital key didn’t work because I wasn’t on their Wi-Fi but even when on wifi it didn’t work causing me a 1 hour delay getting into our room. I spent $20 for early check in to check in after my normal check in time.
50,It was an incredible experience and the staff was phenomenal. Our stay was so welcoming we wanted to extend the stay but had to depart due to business. We will definitely visit again. We will return soon.
50,I love staying at the Luxor great and friendly workers.. everyone is so helpful and pleasant. Also the food at the Casino was great as well.. Loved the drinks too.....Only thing I did not like the parking situation.. You have to pay 15 dollars a day for parking. But overall everything else was excellent!
20,our room was very dirty upon arrival and never really was cleaned correctly our entire five night stay. The casino area was nice and the people in the restaurants and such were very nice and helpful. overall a MEH stay due to the room being so dirty.
10,We stayed at the Luxor and originally reserved a room in the pyramid. We wanted to stay in the iconic structure. We were never told the room wouldn’t be available the entire stay. We were upgraded to a “tower” room which was really sub standard. I’m really disappointed with MGM as this is not their usual service method. We should have been notified earlier the pyramid was unavailable not at the check in counter when the reservation was made almost a year in advance.
50,I love the location. Close to everything you need. Rooms are okay and it looks updated. Bars stay busy and one bar has a DJ. The Backstage Deli is a must! Usually open late and really good food. Players club section has been simplified and coshares with Cashiers area.
50,We had a great time at the Luxor! We chose the Tower Premium King Rooms because another reviewer stated it was quieter. Not quite but who really sleeps in Vegas?    The Pyramid Cafe has endless Mimosas and Bloodies for $19.99. So worth it and a great way to start/end the day.    If you book a Tower Premium King Room be careful. These rooms are on the end of the halls beside a stairwell. Our last night we awoke to someone trying to break in to our room (9th floor) with a screwdriver. Cameras are not located at the end of the hallways nor in the stairwells. Luckily we scared him as he must have thought our room was empty. He escaped down the stairwell. Security was called and they walked the halls and stairway but he had disappeared after our threats.    Again we had a great time and would just advise everyone to be aware of your surroundings and use the deadbolt.    Be prepared to walk a lot.
20,Disappointed in the Luxor it used to be sort of a luxury option but any more the Luxor is showing it’s age and most of the luxury options have been removed from the whole experience. The staff is friendly enough but that can’t help making the whole experience more of an off the strip cheap hotel.
20,Poor Luxor used to be such a beautiful place. I don't think they have updated anything in 20 years. Floor of room was grubby bathroom needed caulking cabinetry was peeling elevators have been beaten the heck out of mattress severely sagging in the middle. Workout room was nice. Sorely in need of an update.  Staff was nice.
50,Love the decor. Room was nice. I could hear dog barking. Lots of slots to choose from. Would stay here again. Easy to order food to go. Waitress were all nice and helpful. Easy to get taxi no lines. Loved my stay.
10,We had to move five times the heater in our rooms didn’t work and there where cum stains on the couch the one room that we ended up staying in had one ac heater unit that worked and one on the bedroom side that did not work I had moved five times so we made it work
50,Its always a Awesome stay at the Luxor! This is the only Hotel I book when I visit Vegas. The Rooms and service are very nice. Wish I had more opportunity to visit Vegas just to stay here at the Luxor!
10,Cheap rooms and unfriendly staff no fridge in even expensive rooms  parking fee not even coffee makers in their expensive rooms every thing has extra fees  lots of noises in rooms dirty hottest and showers  dirty and smelly rooms  no hand sanitizers in any place
20,Lack of resort amenities. Poor cleanliness in room and hallway. Check in/out was easy. Over priced for what was available. Mattress was a little too firm for my tastes but wife rented well. No hangers or fridge in room to create a more relaxed stay. Hallway/room smelt like marijuana all weekend causing migraine headaches. Water leak in hallway caused slippery conditions on tile.
50,The room was nice and clean the bed comfy and getting on public transport from the hotel was a breeze. One issue occurred during our stay the water in the shower quite the morning we were leaving. The Luxor compensated us by covering the resort fees for the entire stay.
50,This is a great place to stay for a weekend getaway with a great location and excellent service. The rooms are good sized and the view is great. I will definitely be staying here on my next trip to Las Vegas!!!
40,Excellent clean hotel great staff very good food. our only problem was the our room was cold. Couldn't get the heat to blow hot air. Other then that I would recommend thus hotel. We had a wonderful time. Even won a total of 1000 bucks in the casino.
10,We checked in without an issue. When we returned to our room one evening we received a notice saying they would have scheduled water maintenance. No issue. It was between 11pm and 6am (overnight). Ok - no problem. Well the next morning we went to shower and had no water. Our water didn’t come back on until 8am. Then we went to shower and the hot water was cold. No hot water. So I called the front desk. No answer. I called housekeeping. They never sent someone to check. I stopped down to the front desk and they said they would refund 4 days of resort fees. Ok - I was happy. I understand issues happen. When I checked out they argued that only 1 day of resort fees could be refunded. Ugh. Not recommended.
20,No heat  Refrigerator did not work  Extra chargers on your bill  Talk to customer service and she said that’s not her fault we should have self parked to have a cheaper bill. Definitely unprofessional…..
30,There could be more updates done to this hotel here and there you could smell sewage. The bathroom in the casino area by the buffet alway smelled bad when I walked past. So I would never go in. Location is great and overall the service was excellent.
40,Over all not a bad hotel. We got a great deal on the room. The hotel was clean and had plenty of options. The room was a bit less tuan clean. It could have used a good dusting. Othervthan the lack of hot water in the hotel one morning it was a good stay. I would stay here again.
40,We stay at Luxor whenever we are in Vegas and over the years we have had consistently good experiences. The staff is overly friendly and helpful. The restaurants have excellent food and quick service. It is convenient to walk underground to other shopping areas the Mandalay Bay convention center and the tram stops at the hotel as well.
10,The check in process was ok but very slow. The casino was fine and the food options for the morning and evening we’re good. As soon as we walked in the room it was dirty. Rubber bands were on the counter hair all around the floor by the shower and trash pieces behind the toilet. A tile had fallen off the kick area under the sink. The carpet is sad and needs replacement.
40,If you wanna stay in one of the iconic hotels in Vegas and cheaper rates this is the place to be. although it's old and some furniture are dated. It's clean and convenient from The Strip. It has 24hrs casino and restaurants available at the ground level. The elevator is unique as it travels sideways and you can feel dizzy because of this. On our 2nd night there was fire alarm at around 3AM which lasted maybe 30 mins and when we open our room theres this huge water leakage all over the place. Some guest need to be relocated as their room were flooded luckily ours is fine but they need to install the blowers to dry off the wet carpet infront of our room which is very noisy all day. As an Asian i would like to see theres an open asian resto there was one but unfortunately it was closed maybe due to covid restriction or had been affected by closer am not sure. It was a good stay it would have been great if theres no flooding happended.
30,Hotel was just ok. Two bedroom suite was run down. TVs worked some of the time. Bathrooms were poor celling was falling down mold. Casino we clean and staff was nice. Mlife at the cage was great very helpful.
40,We needed a stop over in Las Vegas and we decided to take a few extra days when we saw the excellent price for the rooms. Despite a hidden resort fee that didn't pay off due to the pools being closed in the winter it still was an excellent price for a large and clean room and very good service by friendly staff. Watch out for extra fees for things like resort fees parking your car as well as transport fees from and to the airport since there are no hotel shuttles.
20,Hotel is dirty and run down. You get what you pay for... In this case not because with their ridiculous resort fees it's not even worth it. Had several days of hot water issues. Had a similar problem on a trip earlier in the year. Next trip to Vegas will be to a much better hotel. Not sure what is happening with the MGM properties but they all seem to be having issues.
40,beautiful and friendly hotel good service even when one day they did not do room service. I would still go back. as a recommendation change the pillows I felt a stone on my neck I had to sleep without her
20,The room was dirty ac didn't work so the room was hot and muggy. The hallway had a water leak so there was a gross smell. Shower was moldy. I stayed there from Monday until Friday night and not once was the light at the top of the pyramid lit up. I looked every night.
30,room looked clean and bed was comfortable. The 1st night the music was very loud until the wee hours of the morning. it was a very smokey hotel so if you have allergies be aware. The one bigger problem was the toilet as you had to flush it 3 times just to get 1 piece of paper to d  go down. it's an older budget hotel so was not expecting much but it meet our needs
10,Horrible stay experience staff didn’t care. Wasn’t giving my rooms that I reserved. Plumbing is horrible. Rooms smelled very old and stale. Only compensation that I was giving was $10.00 dollar game play that didn’t even work. Would never stay here again. Not only me but half the wedding party was very disappointed with the Luxor.
20,I had a great offer for complimentary rooms resort credits and freeplay from the luxor.  I had a terrible experience last time I stayed but I booked a 2 room elite tower suite and crossed my fingers for the best.    It was... better(?) than my last stay.    The towers are a LONG walk away from any food or drinks and room service is unavailable for the foreseeable future so youre going to have to hoof it.    The tower rooms are nicer than they were 6 Years ago so the remodeling they did helped however there were no box springs on the beds and they were sinking into the slat bed frame and impossible to enter or exit without a bruise to the thigh or shin.    The bathrooms were spacious but poorly lit and for the better. When you looked closely there was so much filth...  Better not to look.    The sinks and toilets were very clean but how do you clean all the cracks in the tub and shower really?    I stayed mid week and most higher end restaurants were closed but Diablo did have some great chicken fajitas!    The lobby Starbucks is the fastest I've ever seen thank goodness so I did have coffee!    The hotel is really worn down.  Its a great lower cost choice for families and football fans but not a spa destination at all.    The elevators all have broken panels exposed wires if they are operating at all.    So. Much. Trash. Everywhere.    Everywhere.    But it was worth a try.  The bartenders were fun and fast the service Staff was attentive and kind.  10 stars to them!    3 for the hotel itself currently.    Might try again in a few Years just to see how it looks lol
50,For an older hotel on the strip it was kept very clean. Engineering staff very friendly especially Alex and Hanna. They were able to resolve TV and AC issue right away. Valet staff was also friendly and quick.
30,The hotel was great ended up just throwing away the baby bottle but our room was not cleaned properly considering how there was a baby bottle in the couch when we arrived was not happy about the cleanliness of the room.
20,Is good for three nights and had an issue every night I stood with TV AC and water wasn’t working I tried to upgrade my room multiple times during the weekday and wasn’t able to. I enjoy gambling at the Luxor but most likely won’t stay there again
20,"Be sure to check your room. Our first room had no A/C and our ""upgraded"" room had a personal bar of soap left in the shower and garbage not picked up underneath the desk. Made me wonder if they even took the time to change the sheets."
10,A bed with urine and rude staff. I had to move rooms because there was piss on the bed. The bathroom was covered in pubic hair and marks on all of the mirrors and glass. I'm a disabled combat veteran and I wouldn't recommend this place to my worst enemy.
50,The Luxor was conveniently located for my meetings. The amenities shops and restaurants are very good. I enjoyed the convenience of the no-key check in / check out The housekeeping staff were helpful and all contact with hotel personnel and reps was positive.
40,Doing the best they could dealing with useless Mask mandates forced upon nevada like one of 1the all 10 democrat governed states still requiring them killing business for no scientific reason luxor did a great job making due. Trying hard to give patrons a close to normal experience
10,Someone broke into my room. Clearly an inside job with maintenance or cleaning crew. Room was opened at 4:30 and left open. Nobody from my group was there. Stole $128k of things from me. Do not go here.
10,At 11:45 we got to our room and exhanged gifts for a wedding renewal. At 12:00 we got a knock on our door from security Nico who said we got a noise violation for LAUGHING. Mind you No one was drunk. That he can hear us laughing from hallway and we will get evicted. We specifically told front desk day 1 that there will be a get together to cut a cake. Which then they never had any record of it day of. Horrible place to spend birthday. Never again. Excalibur is 100% more friendly.
30,"Get a couple hard copies of the room key instead of using the digital key from MGM app. The app kept crashing and made it impossible to use the digital key. The staff and service was ok. Excalibur had better service and staff than the Luxor. The staff that were greeting in the booth across mini mart were so rude.(Coming from the Uber/Lyft extrance) We asked where we can find our rooms. "" You can read the signs right? Do not get lost. If you do just ask of people with Luxor name tag to help you.-Staff reply"""
40,Need to get better pillows for the rest.  Have to go get a massage now due to lack of head support while trying to rest in the room. Beside that would like to see more signs for the food court. Those were not mentioned.  Only reason we ended going upstairs was to the Mandalay shops and to go over to the casino over there.
40,This property is very conveniently located to all attractions restaurants and shopping. The hotel is immaculately clean and cleanliness is maintained by the minute. Staff is very thorough and remain invisible (which is a good thing).
10,Was charged and almost $40 a day resort fee at checking. The check in person was very rude and unhelpful. Hallways were constantly dirty. Casino lacked TLC: there were empty cups bottles and dirty ashtrays everywhere.
50,We stayed in the newly remodeled Pyramid and it was great. Beautifully decorated clean and the staff was very friendly and accommodating! Close to lots of great restaurants and shops. We will be back soon!
10,The bed was comfy the room was a nice size and the bell hope service was great. The bathroom looked as though they just swapped out the linen though. The tub looked dirty there was a pube hair stuck to the clean towel rack. The shampoo/conditioner samples are terrible (bring your own). The towels are small and rough and im pretty average in size. Then to come home to a daily resort charge of $79.36.. that was the icing on the cake to never stay here again.
50,The whole experience had a very good vibe! From the casino floor to the Steak house(Tender) to the rooms. I will definitely come back. I've stayed at 12 or more hotel casinos in Las Vegas and I really enjoyed my complete experience at the Luxor
50,Great ppl environment rooms r always clean give good deals and machined do hit. And their quick 2 accommodate you n any way possible. Rooms are always clean. If not they will give u another rm. Stuff r helpful n friendly
20,The check in process was horrible. Waited on line for 35-40 mins to check. One staff member was telling her life story to everybody who went to her for check in. The hallway in the east tower smelled like mildew. Dead roaches on the floor. King size bed looks like a queen size bed. No microwave or refrigerator in the room. Homeless people roaming around the hotel. I will not stay here again
40,Can't beat the price Comfortable pillows and bed. Friendly staff. Completely happy with our stay Don't get mistaken its still a bit dated but we barely spent time at the hotel for we were walking all over town
20,Being on hold for 30+ minutes when water off  Nobody said anything  Digital key didn’t work for parking all week  Housekeeping had come in when we optd out  Controllers in the room didn’t work  We couldn’t take a shower until 10-11 am
40,We've stayed all over Vegas over the years but never here. We are glad we did and will be back! The stay was perfect and the entire staff was incredible. The rooms were clean and well maintained the bed was cozy and the food options were great. Vegas has changed so much & the changes aren't always for the better so we didn't go in expecting much - we were pleasantly surprised. We will definitely return!
30,The old Luxor was a model of luxury and this certainly wasn't. The elevators were rickety. One of them had a room keypad that didn't work and it seemed that was the only elevator that came every time we push the button. The room is themselves need renovating and the lack of even our coffee pot in them as a covid preventive measure seems ludicrous in light of the fact that there is smoking everywhere in the casinos. They don't seem to worry about the exhalation of the smokers spreading covid as much as a coffee pot that presumably the housekeeping staff would have washed. Overall our stay was adequate but certainly not quite what we had hoped for.
50,Our stay in the pyramid section of the Luxor was surprisingly quiet and amazingly comfortable. Staff and surroundings at this property on the strip exceeded our expectations. FYI tip there is a second Starbucks location that can save you some time in the morning
30,Good customer service at check in. Decent price for late check out. Starbucks was a plus. Room smelled like smoke nothing special easy quick clean place to sleep for a night. Easy check out process no need to go to front desk
30,First I want to say the staff was great! Our room was clean however definitely needed some repairs and updating. Location not the best for connecting with shuttles monorail and walking. We were attending the World Market and it was not convenient and the staff wasn't even sure where that was. However happy to find out.
30,Room was dirty upon arrival had bad odors and constantly had migraines due to the smell of marijuana coming from other rooms near ours. For paying for resort fees they don’t really have a lot to offer!
20,No room service. No coffee maker in the room. When asked for one was told they were only for Premier rooms.  Took forever to get hot water in the shower. Overall not impressed. Next trip we will stay at another hotel
50,You won’t go anywhere else been going to Vegas’s:7 to 9 times a yearsMGM properties are always well maintained and the service is one of the bestMGM properties will always be my first choice always !
40,I traveled to Las Vegas for business The Shot Show. I wanted a location that was following Covid protocols and providing a safe environment as much as possible. I wanted to stay in a location with all the amenities but off the beaten path and incidental crowds once I returned to my hotel.    The Luxor was a perfect choice for my needs. Most importantly the customer service at checking was magnificent and housekeeping assisted me whenever I called! I loved the Egyptian motif and artwork was beautiful. I will most definitely stay at the Luxor hotel in the future.
50,Hotel is very clean and up to date. The hotel is connected to others and offers a variety of food And services. In all the hotel is Amazing friendly staff and convent location. Really enjoyed my stay!
50,Stayed in a 1 bedroom tower suite for 3 days. Tried using mobile check-in for the 1st time and was simple. Got a message at 1pm to say room was ready and to get digital key on phone. This proved helpful as I was shopping at the time so on arrival at hotel I valet parked and took luggage and shopping straight to the room.  Room was a large living room with a couch and 2 chairs with a small table. A dining table with 2 chairs tv a mini fridge and a sink.  Bedroom had king size bed with another TV a chair and a bench at the bottom of the bed.  Bathroom had his and her sinks with a bath and a separate shower.  I ate at the pyramid cafe diablos cantina and public house. All were decent quality and reasonably priced.
40,The rooms could use a few things like USB ports but kept up quite well. A pleasant stay in the middle of a lot of fun. Blue Man and the Titantic along with Bodies were all part of this trip. Very enjoyable shows.
20,"See my previous comments.  Parking charges was a surprise.  Fire alarm test at 6:30 in the morning was an awful experience. There was no coffee maker no fridge and no microwave in the room - and our room was ""premium""???"
20,This hotel did nothing to enhance the Vegas experience. First I had to switch rooms because my television was broken and the toilet leaked in the washroom. The new room wasn’t any better and the bed was highly uncomfortable. Then the food was bad in the food court and the cafe. They were understaffed as well which is understandable seeing as we are in a pandemic.
20,Upon arrival to our room I found that the curtains were falling off the wall and someone had use the commode and left a bowl. It took me three trips to the front desk to transfer to a different room. The desk staff was not very helpful but fortunately a nightmare Andrew came to our rescue after the third trip to the front desk
30,Unimpressive at best. Rooms are dated and plain. Elevators were in sad shape and in need of maintenance. Pretty boring options in the food court. Wifi was terrible. Over all not a place I would go back to or recommend.
20,Shower was a mess flooding on floor  No staff to come to clean room  No fridge or micro  Nothing special  There are so many places off the strip that would be better bang for your buck.  Of course check in was a good experience cause I didn’t have to talk to anybody all I had was an electronic card which the service is spotty with the Wi-Fi so a lot of times I was sitting there waiting for my phone to connect so that I could even take the elevator up to my room and even get into my room at times
50,Great bed. great view bring your own coffee maker micro and cooler they don't have either. recommend staying on first floor elevators go up on an angle makes you feel dizzy. Self parking is inexpensive. Unload your stuff than go to self parking ..your feet/back will thank you.
40,The Luxor pyramid rooms have been re-done  the shower was great. The pyramid rooms are really quiet ; do to the hotel design. The heat in my room did not work  I didnt really care so i never reported it til I checked out. be prepared for quite a few restaurants and shops have reduced hours . Vegas 24/7 is a thing of the past.
50,I enjoyed it all food was great staff was amazing and the room was nice! I didn’t have any problems whatsoever. Strip wasn’t far at all. Check in was made simple and easy elevators are super facts no long waiting.
10,I did not feel I was treated as a VIP nonetheless a platinum member. Very rude staff in fact the front desk clerk told me it was in a “a ghetto hotel where they usually do not fix problems like mine”. I have usually received outstanding services at other MGM properties I am not sure why this one was so different but apparently from talking to other guess this is the norm of the Luxor
50,Our stay at the Luxor is always a great time. The rooms are nice and the staff is friendly. I love the ease of check in using the Mlife app. The staff at the bell desk is always friendly and prompt. You always feel important when you stay at the Luxor.
10,Dirty Dirty room  No where to hang your towels No coffee maker no refrigerator. Dirty carpet  Thin blankets. and on and on. Go somewhere else not Luxor! They rather keep the Refrig in the basement then to give to customers room. Charge you extra at the check in desk and for what?
40,Luxor was better than expected. For the price as compared to other hotels I was optimistic but pleasantly surprised. Staff was very nice rooms were better than I expected and overall I would consider staying there again.
20,Bathroom was missing towel hooks&shower leaks lots of water on the floor. TV might not work with the paid movies service. Wrong room bill summary showed on the TV. Overall close location and decent distance to the strip if you are ok with driving and parking at other resorts.
40,booked my room in advanced. got checked in no problem and really quick despite the long line. staff super friendly and helpful. they accommodated my sister for the small issue she had. we was on a family birthday trip. we all enjoyed ourselves
30,Spent 4 days on business and had fresh bedding every day. More time could of been spent on cleaning some of the old dust off the furniture as it was deep enough to write your name on it. With sanitizing that needs to take place in our Pandemic world this was not! otherwise nice stay. Mask up and be safe.
10,Our check in early was not honored our rooms had hidden fees we were not told of resort fees charged but not sure for what. Masks not always enforced. Rooms filthy bowel movement in one of them. The dust was so thick and the floors did not appear to have seen a vacuum in awhile. The bedspreads had stains all over and gave me the impression it had not been changed. We called housekeeping and were given $25 vouchers and moved rooms. That being said the rooms main areas seemed a bit cleaner but the bathrooms far more disgusting. All I can say at least these rooms did have bowel movements in them. Do your research to stay further onto the strip this is really out of the way from the main strip and Fremont.
20,The prices are low but the place is starting to look pretty run down and dirty in some areas. The entrances are dirty elevators are somewhat damaged and garbage cans are often overflowing. Every day there would be piles of dirty sheets and towels piled in the hallway for hours at a time. The food court and Diablo restaurant were shockingly bad.
50,We really enjoyed our stay at Luxor. The staff was incredible from casino floor to the salon. The rooms were clean and comfortable. It was our first time but would definitely go back! Keep it up guys!
50,The Luxor was super cool to explore. It was a little more mellow than other casinos which I liked. Loved the tilty elevators and how friendly all the staff were. It had everything we needed and more. Would love to come back!
10,Luxors been around and its a staple hotel on the strip. its an Icon. but man! the inside is ok but the rooms were not what I have imagined at all. I could have just stayed at Ballys or Linq for the same price. Quite not happy with the experience.
50,I will be staying here from now on the location the staff my room and everything was nice I do wish they had a fridge and microwave in the room however that won’t stop me from staying here again in the future my new favorite hotel
20,Part of the bad rating is the length of time it takes to get to the elevator for your floor then our room was almost as far as you could get from the elevator. Not fun when dragging suitcases and sports equipment. The overall design is just poor. Common spaces such as elevators were dirty. Our room did get cleaned everyday which was nice. However the rooms are very outdated .
40,We stayed at the Luxor on business. I thought the room was a good value. Our room was clean except for a few bobby pins under the desk. The beds were comfortable and it was quiet. We stayed in the pyramid and had a nice view of the strip. We would stay here again.
20,The rooms were damaged and no amenities at all were inside. I stayed on Luxor before and they used to be the best but I do not recommended at this moment. They need to do a little extra work on the rooms !
40,I'm a repeat customer staying at the Luxor. My overall stay was very good with only a few minor issues. Most of the gaming employees were very good and the only major issue I had was with the limited hours of the buffet.
20,We were scheduled to stay 7 days we had to leave early after 5 days and were charged full price for the remaining 2 days. This wasn't obvious in any of the check-in information. The shower pan was broken in at least 3 places the shower door had a bad case of corrosion the bed was worn out and sagged in 2 places the tv had signal issues  no coffee pot or small refrigerator
50,Would stay there in a heart beat. Continue to keep up the excellent service. Wish some of the promotion were ready available on your website. overall great experience but I should not expect to recieve nothing less than excellent
20,We stayed only 1 night as a layover on our way to our final destination. Chose the Luxor for proximity to airport which did not disappoint however I think we were given one of the worst rooms - tired dirty  smelly and most of all NO toiletries not even hand soap. We had not brought any with us as we were trying to travel light. We asked a maid but she didn’t speak much English and said she did not have any!! So we had to go and buy some. No coffee machine or water. Bathroom in need of a deep clean.    Overall the hotel is tired and desperately needs a refurb    We stayed in a pyramid room
40,We had a wonderful stay. I’d recommend looking into finding a way to keep the water from spraying onto the floor from the shower and fixing the moving walkways but otherwise it was an absolutely wonderful trip! Great food selections GREAT room size and comfort!
50,Our stay was exciting and fun filled. Our room was upgraded to a tower room and the extra walking was good for us. Enjoyed Blue Man Group and Diablos Cantina. Easy access to other cool casinos and shopping in the area. Very clean for Las Vegas. The ice machine worked really well too.
50,The Luxor in Las Vegas was everything i had hoped for as someone who was just going to vegas alone to get away from everything this was the perfect location for me. Pretty views and easy walks from the casino floor to my room. Solid Stay
40,Check in was goo & helpful staff. The room was nice & loved the view out the room & inside looking down onto the courtside. Room was clean & beds were great. Came for a convention & took in restaurants & entertainment along the way. Better than average hotel but not the best on the strip.
10,Sofa was disgustingly dirty and stained. All furniture and tile is cracked and scratched and stained. None of the staff knew anything about conventions being held I.e. location. Buffet was good but in the basement.
20,They only give late check out to theor low tiered rooms which is stupid if you want quality and accommodating staff and clean rooms stay at the Delano instead. The beds at the luxor are lopsided and hard too.
20,Parking was constantly an issue with pearl/military rewards card.  Rewards card kept getting frozen couldn't use any reward points while visiting.  Room was decent however the shower sucked! Shower didn't have a door only a forward glass panel which meant 1/2 the shower was open permanently. The water temperature was barely warm at best. A 4ft glass panel was in the direct path of the shower know which meant you had to walk into the shower brace yourself to blasted by cold water when turning the shower on then run out before experiencing hypothermia!?  I visit Vegas 3-4x a year I guess it's time to start looking for a new get away hotel.....
50,Comfortable affordablestylish decor in the rooms friendly staff. Blue Man Group was awesome-l would see them again.Nice selection of food choices also. Easy access to the strip and connecting hotels.
10,Our bathroom sink was clogged. We attempted to have it resolved mutiple times but nobody answers the phone at the front desk and there is always a very long line to talk to someone at reception. It was finally fixed on day 2 of our stay. Then the person in the room next to us tried to get in through the adjoining doors one night at 3am. Our 7 yr old daughter was with us so this made us feel extremely unsafe. Front desk didn't seem to care one bit. This wouldn't have even been an issue if they had put all 3 of our rooms together as requested from the beginning which we were told was done and then wasn't. We also called back in November to confirm the pool was going to be open for the winter only to be disappointed upon arrival because apparently they decided to close it for the season this year. Overall just a terrible experience.
10,Had to park at Tropicana d/t no parking. They tried to sneak money on my bill. Heat/AC was broke in room. They charge hotel guest for parking and then do not even have a place for you to park. Room was dirty with items left under chairs. Elevators erratic stopping at random floors.
30,Check in was a breeze room was ready right away. We were in tower room. It was a looonnnng walk from check in to room and it just happened we were the last room at the end of the hall. Lol room was average nothing fancy. Bed was not the best I’ve had but we slept well because we were so tired. Asked for a fan and promptly received one. There was no hot water when shower time came ;( Called down and they send they would send someone up. We have up and got in bed and at 10:30 they knocked on door (almost 3 hours later) we declined. The next morning the hot water worked. Idk if it was just over used or what the issue was. Overall I would not choose to stay here again but for those on a budget or wanting a quiet resort it would be good. Definitely older and dated. It was a little far from the action of mid strip and not near as lively -not any nightlife etc. the crowd in casino was thin and older. (I’m 48- and they were older than us) lol We stayed here one night on a comp night with M Rewards just to try something new.
30,Bathroom experience was terrible…the hand held shower head was just wrapped around the shower rail and made a mess everytime it was on…you had to let the shower head hang while you washed so you would get cold and again the mess…the shower had only a curtain no door so the entire bathroom floor was a mess…i almost slipped once when i stepped out cause there was literally a puddle outside…the stuff was great though! The beat thing about my stay was the customer service through the hotel casino and restaurants…except the bartenders they kept ignoring us lol
10,We going up for one for my mom funeral an this was the wrost ever. This trip to the luxor was the worst ever I was going up for my mother's funeral she had passed away and they were having a funeral service for her today
10,No bottle water NO COFFEE POT no microwave no fridge upgraded room had 3rd floor view of parking lot! Disappointed! Ck in line 45min! Hallways were nice room ventilation was terrible. Basic 2 egg meat 1 slice toast breakfast for 2 $55 after the morning coffee you have to get dressed and walk 1/2 mile to pu at starbucks $13... more benefits at Motel 6!!!!!
40,Property is good rooms could have been a bit better as I did find some small hairs in shower and bathroom floor but everything else ok. Door for main entrance did not work for one of our two rooms and it took maintenance a good 30-40 minutes to arrive and open the door. Lobby and casino area is dated and needs a refresh and a minimum change the lights to brighter ones. Staff was not really around offering to take drink orders only at tables and not at the machine slots.
10,I was overcharged well over what the cost of my stay was. Never staying at Luxor again. Furniture is outdated even in the new rooms. Elevators also weren’t working well during my stay and staff were nonchalant about the matter.
30,First room had half of a shower door. I requested another room. The Second room had hair in the tub like someone had just shave and the razor cover was on the tub. The tv also needed to be reprogrammed. They ga e me another room which was nice. No issues. They also credited the resort fee for one day.
50,I’m Very satisfied my with stay at Luxor. I’ve stayed here every time I have come to Las Vegas and never had an issue. Always very clean and friendly. I like that it’s close to the airport it makes coming and going super easy.
40,Great customer service hotel was in a good location. I liked the fact that hotel wasn’t in the middle of the strip seeing as I was there for more of a business trip. The hotel itself has plenty to offer and I didn’t mind the walk/ drive to the center area of the strip. Parking can be an issue on weekends.
50,We stayed Jan 17-19th. The room had some updates to it and was really clean. The room was ready upon our arrival shortly after noon. We used the MGM app to check in and for the room key. This was such an easy process. No line to wait in upon arrival or check out. This was the easiest stay I have ever had at a hotel. The only down fall was the room has no mini fridge. So you have no way to keep anything cold if you would like. The room does have a safe in it as well. Other reviews talked about how horrible the service was they had and how dirty the room was. We never had an issue with service and the room was very clean. I would differently stay here again.
50,Staff helpful and friendly. Would stay again in the future. Mobile ap problems and staff assisted. Rooms clean and spacious. Room service provided at customer convenience. No problems with staff and building.
20,We decided to stay at the Luxor because it’s a 4 star hotel with dirt cheap rooms… we should have read the reviews first. The pyramid theme is cool but the hotel itself is dark and outdated. And the smell. It’s awful. Not enough air circulation to offset the cigarette smoke so they pump this awful flowery perfume into the air. Even thinking about it makes me nauseous.    The tables were so expensive - much nicer hotels have much cheaper and better machines/games.    The staff messed up our reservation when they gave us a free upgrade (water issues in the rooms we paid for). We were excited initially but they’d actually double booked the room and not only did we disturb the people who were already there we thought we might not have a place to stay. They gave us meal vouchers that paid for about 2 meals for the two of us. Appreciated but a bit lacking.
10,The elevators require you to scan your room key before you can choose a floor to go to.    Unfortunately the key readers did not work properly on any of the four elevators I tried and we were stuck on the elevators several times. A number of other guests also experienced the same issue alongside us.
50,First trip to Vegas. Hotel was very clean room was bigger than I expected. We even had a mini fridge which was a welcome surprise! No complaints at all about our trip definitely. Mattresses were comfy and housekeeping came daily!
40,This hotel is lightly dated but for the price you can’t beat it. Downfall in the Pyramid Premier Queen suites are no mini fridges or microwaves. Beds are extremely comfortable got the best sleep of my life I believe. Elevators are a bit sketchy but you get used to it and make sure to get a plastic key card because they won’t usually accept the mobile key. Overall would stay here again.
50,Everything was smooth. Digital check in was awesome staff friendly room clean!!! Location is great in proximity to other attractions. Connected directly to Mandaley Bay and Excalibur gives you other dining and shopping options as well.
50,I am still amazed at the quality of the mattress and pillow for a mid-level resort. I slept better than ever before at a hotel. The pyramid window is a nice unique experience along with the inclinator elevator. For a value price on the Strip I think you can't go wrong here. Also unless you NEED to speak to a person for check-in I highly recommend that you use the app to check in and out as well as for a digital key. The app will let you know when your room is ready and directions to the room. Your phone acts as a digital key in the elevator and for your door.
50,When we are in the 702 we stay at the Luxor! It’s not the most centrally located hotel/casino but we like it anyway! Rooms are newly renovated and the place has remained affordable since we first started making trips to LV over 10 years ago. We love visiting the other casinos but stay at the Luxor. We tend to have good luck on the tables too so that helps with the whole vibe!
40,Rooms were well kept and the housekeeping staff was wonderful.  Location was decent for walking the strip.  Casino atmosphere was nice and staff was very friendly/professional.  Did not enjoy the restaurant selections but would definitely give The Luxor our business upon return.
10,Took a trip to Las Vegas with my girlfriend whom has asthma just before Christmas. When we arrived in the room my girlfriend commented to me about a breathing issue the next morning she noted the issue at this time we had no idea why. On the morning of our last full day in Las Vegas in had rained all morning and we heard water dripping I turned on the lights in the room to discover rain entering the room via the window and running down the ceiling light. We called the front desk and they advised us that it was ongoing issue that they knew about they stated that they would send somebody up to our room with towels nobody arrived and by this time two hours later the ceiling was starting to fall down. We called again and this time they said they would move us to another room while waiting for them to arrive to move us I investigated around the window by removing the curtains and to our astonishment we found mold around the top of the window which was dry meaning it had been there for at least 6 months. My girlfriend asthma breathing problems was due to the mold in the room. We have been home now for over a month and MGM resorts have done absolutely nothing for us which is pathetic and this is why I’m writing this review to warn other customers that maybe thinking of staying at the Luxor Las Vegas
40,Nice place to stay on strip. Elevators were difficult to use with room keys sometimes. Casino was decent but it was a added bonus that casino had 2 walkways connecting 2 other casinos so we could go play at them
10,Carpet in the room was very dirty nothing to hand up your towels in the room Very loud noise from the ice machine right away the room. No room service cheap thin bedding had to can for another blanket
30,The hotel was nice enough. But the location was not ideal. Each time you took a taxi it cost you a minimum of $20. The atmosphere was very subdued and it didn’t seem like there were many people winning big! I much prefer the atmosphere downtown.
20,Very disappointing experience. We were disrespected from the moment we arrived. There is no COVID safety protocol that is enforced and most guests are maskless. The housekeeping staff repeatedly left trash and dirty towels in the room. All complaints were as though we were an annoyance. The front desk was dishonest about the availability of suites for an upgrade and basically gave us their worst/mediocre room.
10,First room was covered in 2 inches of dust. Tub and shower did not drain black dirt was coming out of the drain. Second room was slightly cleaner. The tub stopper was broke. Safe was broke. We found a belt in the armoire which means that the room was not cleaned correctly. No maid service on any of the 4 days that we were at the hotel.
50,The o my thing would be that you have to rent a refrigerator other than that.. everything was great! Not too loud and walls weren’t paper thin. Mobile check in and out was super quick and easy! The casino was great restaurants were delicious! All in all was a great experience and would definitely book again! Can’t wait for the next trip!
10,Paid for a West Tower suite to only get a Motel 6 service and hotel room. My suite was not properly cleaned or sanitized correctly. The bedsheets had hair and we’re stained badly. They clearly don’t care about Covid regulations nor the health of their guests. You pay to have a nice clean room and walk in the entrance and your room floor is sticky and stained. Our room had a thick cigar smell- but yet the suites are “Non Smoking”. The room’s Heater did not work. My room was freezing at night. My allergies all over the place with all the dust and cigar smoke that roamed the entire suite. Had to go down to CVS to buy medicine just to get a good night’s rest. The room was rundown and frames were damaged. Housekeeping steals. They stole my Gold Chain. I called Lost and Found and no one answered. I had to go in person to ask to be told no one had turned anything in. I went to Front Desk and they told me housekeeping has a different lost and found desk where hotel guest’s items are turned in if found. Had I not gone to Front Desk I would’ve been robbed. Management did nothing to address the theft because it magically returned. Do not book here if you care about your belongings. Nothing is safe and no one is helpful. The room maid walked into my room twice even though we had put the Do Not Disturb sign. They make you feel unsafe in your own hotel room. Some elevators didn’t even require a room key to go up. Half of them went up without a room key at all. This will be the last time I ever stay at a MGM Owned Property.
10,No need for an alarm clock because the the kackeling cleaning staff and their music will wake you bright and early slamming doors and surprisingly never vacuuming once except not sure what was cleaned i looked at the same garbage in the corner of the hallways for all 4 days of our stay. What was supposed to be a couples get away turned into the vacay from HELL!!!! First time we stayed off the main strip in and MGM property and not a Caesers property never again...always choose Caesers over MGM!!
50,I brought my son for his first time and he's ready to go back. It was so much to do in the Luxor that we didn't get a chance to do or see. Public House was my favorite as we were there during the wildcard games for NFL. Great atmosphere throughout.
30,Every day we were there the check in line was long and they only had 3 or 4 staff at the front desk. This is unacceptable. They need to hire more employees or pay better so people will want to work and not sit around on unemployment because they claim they are scared to work. Liberal states are the worst for getting people to actually want to do their job.    Bed was soft and I sunk in it and there was no way to keep the fan on the manual setting on the climate control for white noise. Someone rolled a big cart down the hallway at 4 am and woke us up. I've stayed here before and it was much better. Will probably be a long time before I stay here again.
20,There is a distinct stinch throughout the hotel. The rooms need to be updated and cleaned thoroughly especially for the nightly rate charged. The hotel is not located directly on the strip. Seek reservations elsewhere.
50,Loved the atmosphere and the luxurious feel at this hotel. We had a soaking tub in our room and it was a great experience. We had to re-clean it more before use especially due to covid. I felt better disinfecting it prior. Overall great experience and environment.
30,While the staff were awesome. The room was nothing better than a Hampton or LaQuinta. When I booked it did not say I was going to be in a tower and assumed I would be in the main pyramid building. I stayed there for the pyramid experience not a Hampton inn experience. AND other resorts on the strip have free parking.
10,Bath tub not cleaned in first room then shower backed up and electrical outlets did not work in room. Switched to new room and bathroom was not completely clean but better and stayed in the room. Co-worker had a dirty towel on her bed and had to switch rooms also. Cleanliness was in question.
50,We had a very good time there. The rooms were great the bed was wonderful. We rested very good. We had a suite and it was nice to have a living room to sit on to relax and watch tv when t down at the casino.    was wonderf
50,Great stay. Clean rooms. only problem is the shower. It only has one door so when your showing water gets all over the floor. And I almost tripped coming out. My child almost fell coming out as well. Other then that no complaints.
20,MGM Detroit MGM Las Vegas MGM National Harbor Borgata - All these properties should be embarrassed to be affiliated with the Luxor. Maybe I had a bad room I was definitely not impressed. Having stayed at all of the locations above maybe my expectations were set to high? Luxor may be in the family but it definitely is not up to the other properties standards.
10,Rooms where not cleaned. When requested no one came to clean. Request for a room change was not granted. We came to get married with 10 friends and family no one had a good experience. DO NOT STAY HERE!!!!!
20,Bathroom had visible hair in the bathroom and I stayed 3 nights room was never made I did not need it done everyday but at least once would have been nice I never called cuz I figured someone would come but never did
40,Our stay was okay our bathroom wasn’t properly cleaned. It was urine on the seat. I informed a cleaning staff she asked what room but didn’t seem to really understand. I cleaned up myself which was unpleasant especially due to covid
10,We went up for a raider game besides the hotel being close to the reader stadium I wouldn’t stay here stay away the hotels buttons from the elevator horrible they need to redo the whole inside of all of them at the front desk is rude they wouldn’t help my elderly parents get a physical copy because he didn’t know how to use the app the gate person for the parking Was giving my dad an attitude because it also didn’t know how to use the app to open the gate it’s like it’s your job just open it you know where the system
50,My room was very clean. I was impressed. I was inpressed with food court. Very clean. And food was so delicious. Luxor coffee restaurant for breakfast. Amazing. Highly recomend even if you stay in other hotel to come for breakfast
40,If you need a room and you want to be in the heart of Las Vegas stay here. Online app makes it so you can check in skip the line go right to the room and start the party! Easy walk to Mandalay and the Stadiums. Good bars and foods. Save on the room rate and get the best of Vegas!
40,We came there for my son’s wedding. We only stayed one night but will be back for a longer trip in the future. Check in was easy and staff friendly. We only ate at the buffet. Food was good and staff wears great! Look forward to coming back.
50,Would stay here again. West tower room was very clean. Hotel and casino staff was very friendly that Diablo restaurant was very good. We went and mobility scooters in the hotel was very scooter friendly.
20,I wish we knew that we don't have a view we booked for 4nights and no coffee maker fridge we had to request fridge but charged $25. You always get to Starbucks get ur coffee and way way far walking thru elevator to ur room. Wish they got atleast coffee maker to start up your day!  Before I forget their pillow was so junk. Sorry to say
40,Like Luxor. Rooms are getting a little dated compared to the Mirage Park MGM New York New York BellagioAria Mandalay Bay etc. There is a wide variety of restaurant options. All are very good. The Buffet is excellent.
40,Enjoyed our 4 days and 3 nights but the property is a bit dated. We stayed in the Pyramid which is one of the older properties on the strip. Everything was fine. We enjoyed the MGM Sports Betting APP which was a huge plus for this trip. The casino was fine but pretty smoky (I think worse than others due to age).
10,We chose the Luxor because it was the same location as the Blue Man Group show. I regretted the decision quite quickly for several reasons. Staff were super friendly but that was basically the only good thing. Elevators looked like they were falling apart room looked like the refrigerator was pulled out no water or coffee in room (water in machine cost $3) room service was very pricey and water from shower got everywhere. It wasn't the absolute worst experience but I could have had a better experience for the same price at other locations.
20,Room was poorly cleaned. Lobby and guest restrooms were out of soap and were also not very clean. I had a great steak at the casino restaurant. And the bell service was pleasant. Digital keys were not consistently working.
50,We had a great weekend to spend our birthdays (husband and mine). Great price and had a good time visiting Las Vegas and all it has to offer. Only thing that would've been nice is hours posted on some of the eateries.
30,We had a good stay and found room and casino floor to be clean and well kept. Check in was very slow for being error-free and would be good to increase frequency of drink service to players on casino floor.
50,We chose the Luxor based on value we liked that it was not in the middle of the strip but a short Uber ride to everything we wanted to experience. The hotel was clean staff was friendly and easily accessible
20,Rigged Keno machines. Keno machines will not pay anything no matter how much money you put in or how long you play it. I tried for four days thinking well any minute now and nothing not even a little to continue playing a little longer. the Chumash casino machines give you really good odd it is always packed
40,Luxor could use to make some upgrades but we were still satisfied with our stay. It was clean and the staff was polite. Only issue we experienced where long waits to check in and not particularly thrilled about the resort fees daily parking fee or the hold placed on my card. The hold for damages were more than the price of the room for 3 days.
40,Vegas isn't the first place I think of as a family destination but alas a gymnastics meet brought us into town and so we drove 12 hours to show our kids what happens when adults have the option to make bad decisions... We needed a 3 night stay and I didn't want to blow the bank a central location to divide and conquer with the kids (keep the little one busy) was non-negotiable- so Luxor was a trusted brand with a price point that was manageable. The room was a bit dark but clean comfortable beds the lack of towels was immediately rectified view was a bummer (driveway) and the gold finishes on the bathroom - definitely a statement from the '90's; as a parent my biggest gripe - was the lack of a small fridge in the room and a broken ice machine on the floor. The casino is what you'd expect - smoky: cigarettes and other... but otherwise PG fine. We don't gamble no show so I can't speak to entertainment. The location for the price is the biggest selling point with a healthy dose of Vegas-kitchy. The parking garage at night was a hot mess which should give you an idea what check-in looks like - word of advice use the mobile app and save yourself the frustration (we did.) Once we found our room (another source of frustration because it's so fun to drag kids and bags after a long drive in circles) we knew our way around - but know that there isn't a cold cocktail upon reception and porters waiting to take your bags and meet you upstairs. It's definitely a far cry from luxury but you get what you pay for... we still had a good time but I'd definitely liken the experience to more Southwest Airlines over Lufthansa.
40,Thanks Luxor for a great family trip to Vegas. The AGT show was amazing! The Luxor is a great place to stay and close to many other attractions and hotels. The staff was friendly and rooms were nice for the price.
10,Lock up anything and everything the staff goes rummaging through your belongs. It’s very confusing to navigate. The staff had major attitudes and although not outright rude the all seemed tired and not very welcoming. When i spoke to security and the manager on duty they literally laughed in our faces.
50,Friendly staff beautiful room and reasonable price for the room. Hotel is very beautiful and great location. The restaurant has the very best food and like the attraction they have at this hotel. I didn’t have to go any of the other hotel because this hotel has everything to keep you entertained.
10,Wanted to have a great experience but instead saw 2 roaches in the tub. No toilet paper not enough towels. Keys didn't work several times. I have always wanted to stay in the pyramid. We travel at least 4 times to Vegas and this experience at this casino made cry. The room was not at all what I expected. The channels on the tv didn't work. I wouldn't recommend this place to any family or friends.
50,Checked in on a friday afternoon while it was busy. Staff made the experience smooth and pleasurable. Stayed in a corner suite with the soaking tub. Best desicion we have made in years. Room was clean and comfortable.
20,Booked the room because it was the cheapest. It wasn't the worst but it definitely was not up to par with the experience I wanted as my first trip to Las Vegas. Some great staff get overshadowed by one very rude front desk worker trouble with room keys / parking every day of the trip. I would pay a little more and go somewhere else next time.
40,Recently stayed here for first time and it wasn’t as bad as some of the reviews that I’ve ready. Staff was friendly got to ck in super early and besides a cpl small issues with room it wasn’t that bad at all.
20,We stayed a weekend here and the check in online was definitely a good choice because people overcrowded the front desk so you better do your check in online and everything else is average I'll like them to consider changing the shower head because it waste's a lot of water and there's no way to lower the flow of the water the gambling floor is decent and there's easy access to the self parking lot.
50,Just Great Service. On the overall Luxor Hotel. I will recommend other company partners to enjoy a stay with your services. We are now planning new events for the Vegas area throughout our company departments which i will say proudly are going to have your hotel as a choice for our guest as well.
30,The rooms were a big disappointment. I could hear every conversation and luggage wheel rolling down the hallway. Heard lots of banging through the night and had to wear ear plugs to block it all out and get some sleep. The room was pretty dark and dreary but I was not there much so that wasn't a big deal. Otherwise it was an OK place to visit. Will definitely expect a different location if I am forced to stay here again.
10,We came for a trip the 13-16 of January I come about every month or so to this hotel only honestly cause I’ve loved it in past but we got to the hotel pre checked in to have room ready by landing so I pre checked in in portland to give plenty of time we get to Luxor our room wasn’t ready it was fine we were starving we finally get up to room 2 hours after arrival and then we open our first room door it’s so dirty nothings wiped down no toilet paper no towels nothing in it honestly we called for house keeping and went out again they also discovered tv being out of service so they called to move us so we waited til about 5am for second room got into our second room and it had people staying in it prior to us coming in and we ran out thinking we were walking in on someone so at this point I’m boiling and exhausted they got us into a third room and the keys were programmed for us correctly so we had to fix another issue no one would get management for us so we got keys and dealt with being there the only thing to ease our stay they provided late check out an hour after regular check out how amazing right! We will definitely not be returning to Luxor anytime soon
40,I was a bit nervous going to the Luxor with some of the reviews I read. For my experience I was met with friendly staff throughout the resort a clean room and good amenities. The only downside would be the location as it’s at one end of the strip.
20,The Alarm went off for an hour our last night there. We received no instructions on what to do and received no apology or comp. We will go elsewhere on our next trip. Was not impressed at all with the Luxor.
20,This was my 30th birthday trip to Vegas to enjoy the ending of my twenties. The hotel room we stayed in was very poorly taken care of. There was not a working plug in in the bathroom. No fridge to place insulin in for my elderly aunt. The workers outside the building woke us up at 8am. The glass panels in the bathroom do not keep the water in the shower. All in all I’ve had better experiences elsewhere.
50,I had a very nice and clean double queen room. Housekeeping was excellent. Room was in excellent shape. The Hotel is kept up very well. Saw numerous housekeeping personnel in Casino always making sure that the Machines were clean of cigarettes.
50,Great huge clean rooms easy mobile check in great eating spots! Close to Allegient stadium! We didn’t need to drive anywhere! This place had everything we needed! Wasn’t rowdy and cocktail waitresses were everywhere!!!!
30,Carpet dirty and bed size and quality sucks and CS takes forever to answer phone. Was playing on hold forever just for them to hang up and I called back to get my answer but the place had closed waiting for them. And that first deposit is just really paying for 1 night stay they should just tell you that up front
40,The location is a great spot and there are so many options for food shops and entertainment inside of the hotel  The only downside is there are no microwaves anywhere nor any refrigerators and their self parking seems to always be full making the walk back to the room endless
20,This was the first and last time we will stay at this property. The staff was great check in was a breeze but the good ends there. The rooms are sub-par. The shower may as well have had a metal hose coming out of the wall. Everything metal in the hotel area shocks you! The buttons for the elevator door knobs light switches Everything! The toilet in our room constantly backed up even with no toilet paper and the sink water smells like sewer in the morning. The biggest thing is we never felt safe with our children walking from the elevator to our room or vise versa as the railing is low with absolutely no fall protection! (We were on the 25th floor) Furthermore your guest room key only allows you to access the floor you are staying on which is no big deal unless you have multiple people in your group staying on different floor. Not a huge deal but a pain in the butt for sure.
30,The Luxor was fine but nothing special. It is far from other casinos which made for a long walk some nights. We were excited to take the tram but it only goes 1 stop further. The rooms were updated and clean but it was difficult to get to your room based on the layout of the pyramid and you had to take a specific elevator to your floor. We came with a big group as well and because you have to have a room key to use the elevator to your specific floor it made it difficult to see friends we came with at their room. Overall it will work but would probably pick somewhere else on our next trip.
20,The check in process was horrid as I explained earlier. Then we got to the room and there was someone else's dirty used rag on the floor sticky and gooey stuff on two of the tables. The sink didn't drain. There was pubic hair and a woman's black hair on the toilet seat (I have red hair) and a gooey booger substance in the shower floor. The bed pillows had very visible (a thick layer) of dust and clothing lint on them. The bathroom mirrors were dirty as hell. Overall extremely unacceptable experience. I called the front desk and they took over an hour to make any sort of response to the complaint. Finally they gave us another room to switch to (in the middle of the night! ) and actually made us go back down the the front desk to retrieve the new room keys. This whole thing ruined pretty much the entire trip because we lost an entire night if sleep over this. That affected the rest of our trip!
20,My hotel room was dirty and the bathroom was disgusting. My room smelled like smoke and my neighbors were very noisy. My tv barely worked. My elevator barely worked and would take me a few times to get to my room and sometimes I would have to go to the 1st floor a few times.
20,Take time in cleaning the rooms to an exceptional extent. When I pull back the covers I shouldn’t see stains on my sheets. When I attempt to use the room towels I shouldn’t be pulling strands of hair. It’s really disturbing
30,Wanted to treat my wife to a Vegas trip. Haven't been to Vegas in over 6 years. Trip turned out ok. But not what we were expecting. Room should have been up to par. Not looking like it was with shower door water damaged and putty that looked like a 2 year old applied it. Also the chair with stains on it. Who would want to sit in someone's crap. I know I wouldn't.
50,We were greeted at Valet by the kind professional staff. They were quick to collect our bags and park our car. As we entered the hotel/casino everywhere was clean and very inviting. Check in was easy and the staff was very informative helpful and answered all of our questions.  We got to our room and was very pleased with the space and cleanliness that the room offered. It was very quiet and comfortable. It was a perfect space for family!  The hotel/casino had many family friendly options to choose from for entertainment and dining. We did not need to leave to find other entertainment or eating options. We attended the exhibits that are located within the hotel/casino and enjoyed our time thoroughly. All the staff that we interacted with were very patient kind and helpful.  We will definitely stay at the Luxor again.
50,Girls getaway. Stayed at the Luxor. Room was spacious and clean. Excellent value Staff for very friendly  Great location Easy to get around strip.  Had a very enjoyable Spa day. Lovely facility & very relaxing
40,It's a cool place the elevators are a headache. Not a bad hotel at all. The restaurants inside are pretty good and it's set up to where if you did not want to leave the hotel for anything you could enjoy being inside.
20,the lobby is nice but everything outside of that feels old and dirty almost unsafe. the level of workers is very low probably because they can't find anyone to go back to work so they have to settle for the bottom of the barrel. we had bad service almost everywhere in the hotel so I ended up gambling and eating at Caesars down the strip.
50,The front desk had excellent customer service the room was renovated and very clean and room service was consistent with fresh towels and soap. My only critiques would be a much needed re model of the elevators. Other than that it was an excellent stay.
50,The Luxor is all you need for your stay in Vegas. Not super fancy and that’s a good thing! Priced right. Friendly staff. Great food- drinks - shopping. You really never have to leave but transportation is at the curb if you need to do some sightseeing.
10,We paid extra for the fancy tower rooms and they were supposed to be better. No way! Rooms literally had garbage/candy wraps on the floor from last person who stayed. Found cut finger nails inside bathroom. I wish they at least bothered vacuuming the floor. We re in middle of the covid and everything in that room was nasty. Oily spots on night stand dust everywhere. Oh and there s barely any hot water in shower. One of the rooms had a broken AC unit. Constantly blew cold air in middle of January. I tried calling the front desk twice but each time kept on hold and finally gave up. It s sad bcs Luxor used to be my first choice hotel in Vegas. I am done with this place. They need to get their act together.
20,"While it may have been awe inspiring back in the day it is a relic of its 1980s lineage and tired uninspiring and underwhelming like the forgotten asset in a chain as the owners choose to categorically ignore maintenance and upkeep thereby drawing the commensurate crowd. While on the strip it is so far south the location is the worst of all hotels. I left after one night rather than stay the second despite it being free/""comped"" and waste another at this also-ran that was once unique now just dilapidated. Even a member of the front desk had to admit the same."
10,Was first given a used room then upgraded to a smaller room. Fire alarm for over half an hour in the middle of the night with no explanation for the reason or what we should be doing. Whole hotel wasn't very busy but somehow still wasn't very clean.
30,Yep lamp didn’t work soft drink machines at either end of the floor were serving drinks at over 70 degrees. Expected a much better experience than I got. Rooms were good sized and clean but age was beginning to show.
40,I stayed at the Luxor for the PPAI Expo. My stay was very enjoyable. The staff was friendly and helpful. The only thing I didn't like was that there was no refrigerator or coffee maker in the room. Everything else was very nice.
10,Been using MGM over Caesars for years and felt I always chose wisely. Especially with MGM perks.     Well my first trip in two years and three cancelled trips - and I had a huge bag of Myvegas goodies. No black out dates on rewards but of the 10 I got to claim none.  Blacked out the whole week!    I also had three freeplay rewards didnt get the $100 as was over two Mlife bookings; makes zero difference to them but used as excuse to further ruin rewards and holiday. They made the exact same amount just a way to screw you out of rewards the greed of it.    That's if you joined the huge queues to be let down and if it was open. Twice it shut for lunch I kid ye not telling countless folk to come back in an hour. Pathetic.     So onto the Covid elevators. Don't expect a security person to make sure the dirty lowlife law-breaking verm to put a mask on you must take the elevator with countless maskless on each trip. I came down with Omicron and destroyed what was left of my holiday. It was hellish.     Noone hrre gives on turd about the law breakers running wild in their property.     On leaving totally hacked off I asked to speak to casino host given my gambling and closed pools and other crap only to be told there's no-one there.     I'm utterly fuming and they deserve 0 blips. My crowd will be booking Caesars next to try them out and to punish these charlatans.     When it comes to water the fluid of life expect to be spit-roasted if you forget to buy outside. Go over the road to the petrol station to avoid dry bottom proddage.
30,It is past due on remodeling. Prices are extremely high. Diablo mexican resturant is good but cost a pretty penny. We stayed in tower 3B the carpet is nasty the elevator is filthy. Room maid were good
30,Several things added to this score.... During our stay on the very floor we stayed on(19) there was police commotion with banging on doors and what looked to be a raiding of a room with at least 10 officers present on at the time we walked past. It made us feel unsafe as well as confused.    The lower score also relates to mainly unsafe elevators(inclinators). I feel as though they weren't very well maintained. They were visibly dirty and we waited long periods of time for them to even show up (on the lobby or on the floor of our hotel room)    The secondary reason for the lower end of the score was due to the fact that it was difficult to get from our room down stairs seeing as there is only one choice of elevators and only one access point to get to them.    The layout of the rooms only around the perimeter also made it seem like an extra long walking distance to and from.    Aesthetically the hallways looked disheveled.... Random paint covering cracks in old wallpaper didn't help the overall vibe of the hotel.    Lastly I would say the room wasn't anything special it felt somewhat underwhelming with a lack of simple features for today's technology. Outlets barely held in our phone plugs because they were so loose.    There was no access to USB or other simple features like a mini fridge to store medicines or food left overs. The lack of microwave to reheat food was also a bummer.    The outside window was either very polarized or possibly dirty because we could hardly see from it which is kind of a bummer because the lights of the strip are gorgeous to watch.
40,I always enjoyed my stay at Luxor with the Raiders games now in Vegas the resort handles the in-coming game smoothly the self-parking was a bit hectic but normal for game-traffic. The check-in experience is a lot smoother with the MGM Resorts app so if you don’t have it I definitely recommend using it to check into your room to avoid the front desk and wait in line.
50,best place to stay in vegas for raider games home team atmosphere and the stadium walk was a must experience for any fan not to mention the hyper x arena saturday at the speed way was great fun with the kids and only $10 best value in vegas for sure
50,The location Is next to the Bud Light football pre-party  and an easy walk to Allegiant Stadium to watch the Raiders. The hotel is connected by indoor walkways to Mandalay Bay and Excalibur hotels which gives you many dining choices.
30,Only reason to stay here is because how close it is too Allegiant Stadium. Rooms are okay but overall casino floor is dirty and needs to be renovated. Slot pay was terrible but you win some and lose some
20,This hotel was an alright experience. The room smelled like smoke and a couple things did not work. I most likely would not stay here again when there is so many other better hotels. I had an issue at check in and it took us going to 5 people to resolve the issue. I mean if your business center and meeting rooms are closed/booked. You need to find a way to accommodate guests with work calls. I was frustrated with their lack of customer service but one team member Diana/Diane (I forgot her name) was amazing at the front desk! She tried to assist me and check me into another room for my call but I couldn’t move since I was already on my call. The experience at check out was great and they were accommodating but I would never stay again. Room was basic and a lot of things were just okay here.
20,The views were wonderful and the bed comfortable but our soaking tub was dirty such that we couldn't use it and there was what looked like pet hair all over our couch. The surfaces were also generally dusty when we arrived. We booked a tower suite for our anniversary and it was significantly darker than the photos online but that is personal preference I guess. For the price it was not what we had hoped and the couch was not cleaned after we asked. There was also only small shampoos and no conditioner which seemed unnecessarily sparse. The cafe on the ground floor is nice though! Would try somewhere else next time unfortuantely.
40,The room was so far away that I almost had to pack food to get there. Nothing they can do about that it's just the was the place is built. Cafe for breakfast was great. Room was cleaned every day (I had heard that you had to ask to have the room cleaned). Slots was okay - didn't win anything worth while. Steak house was super good. Is it really closed now?
10,I’ve been staying here for almost 20 years and it’s been going really downhill fast the past 5 years. The rooms are disgusting the staff is ignorant and they can’t seem to figure anything out. Pay the extra couple bucks and stay somewhere half decent.
20,We had to walk quite a distance from the elevator to our room which provided us with a very quiet restful sleep. The hotel room is clean but very plain no coffee maker no fridge only two bath towels and only shower stall. The associates at the Mlife desk were not very helpful or hospitable. One night it was a challenge to get the gate to lift so we could leave the garage. Once our garage key was reset there were not further issues. Slots are average some days I could play but other days I couldn't win at all. Some people may be very happy here but with so many other choices we will try a different hotel next time. We visit family in Nevada often. We have been to Vegas 4 times in the last 9 months so we need to find a hotel that fits our needs better.
40,I stayed here mid week room was nice and very reasonably priced. Nice bathroom with walk in shower and separate large tub. The casino here is a bit smaller and the air is smoky. It’s a short walk to both Excalibur or Mandalay Bay abs they have much bigger casinos. Overall a nice place and the pyramid is so cool.
50,Everything was wonderful enjoyed our stay in the pyrimid room and enjoyed walking the hotel and looking at all the exhibits.Getting taxi cabs was a little difficult but that was the only complaint that we had.
50,We had a great time at the Luxor and the staff was amazing. Being close to Allegiant Stadium was a bonus.  We stayed for six days and had the best time. The hotel was clean you could find masks all over the place. Can't wait to go back again.
50,I really liked the theme .It was very clean and organized. Staff was well dressed and friendly. Room appeared to have recently underwent renovation. Diablo s was a very nice restaurant. The Titanic museum was very nice also.
40,I define enjoyed myself stay without a doubt but the one thing that I unequivocally did not like was the fact that the state of Nevada allows patrons to smoke within the designated Casino areas. I do understand that patrons have to right to enjoy themselves but however and in being frank I SIMPLY HATE SECOND HAND SMOKE OF ANY KIND.
50,We stayed in the pyramid. I've read other's reviews saying that the towers are nicer. I stayed in the towers so many years back that I honestly can't remember. I will say this - staying in the pyramid is just plain cool. We had a view of the Mandalay Bay from our room. There's a great view of the casino from within the hallways and the room was excellent. I don't know why anybody would opt for the towers over the pyramid but to each their own. Whenever I stay at the Luxor I'll always go for a room in the Pyramid.
10,My gold chain went missing. Damaged suites that reaked Marijuana and cigar smoke. Third time staying in the towers and never had such a bad experience. Definitely won’t be back! As a local I’m disappointed angry and sad.
50,Big Ass Fun!! Yesssssss!!! 🤲 I’m considering a position in customer relations.. wish me luck 🍀.. thank you. Selena Strumwasser I can only say that everything was perfect. I won some money playing slots.. such Fuchs . I can I say my vacation was splendid. Thank you ever so much I’ll be returning soon.. yahoo!! 🥰
40,Used the mgm app never had to stand in line for check in. App worked just sometimes took some time to load up room key function for elevator and room access. Overall went well. Would stay again when back in Vegas
50,Room for clean everybody was very nice . They did try to change my room I’m disabled and was by myself. Which I told the person on the phone when I booked it. I had 2 knee replacement and was all the way to the end of the hallway. That was very hard I am older.
50,The experience was great…..as usual.  The ambiance is pleasant and relaxing w/ care taker for the air to be fresh and smelling good.  The place is super clean and refreshing.  The staff responding wonderfully and professional.
50,Worth the money spent! Called because we arrived early (drove in) a day early. They allowed us to revise our days and gave us a great rate! Loved the easy check in on the phone and easy check out. Parking was a breeze. Thank you!
40,Family had a great time other than being woken at 1:30 in morning due to alarm. Everything was great and rooms were extremely clean. Everything was close enough for my wife’s 80 year old grandfather to walk to. The food court was more expensive than I thought and they do not accept the MGM reward card. Parking was convenient and with the MGM card it was free.
50,Great location and a great price. Hotel staff is friendly and it is the PERFECT location if attending the Raider games. Great food near by and easy access to tailgate parties stadium and gambling. Thanks
10,Old and not maintained. TV's don't work no alarm clock in the room very few outlets and no USB ports. Most restaurants are closed so very few dining options. My stay was comped and I wouldn't stay here if they paid me $.
10,Need to update hallway elevators and rooms. Staff was friendly and helpful. Elevators looked like they would fall apart any minute. Rooms were weathered looking no fridge or coffee maker. Mattress was old and intetented. Hardly any shampoo. No where to eat breakfast until 8am.
30,overall slight improvement in cleanliness could have made a huge difference. A mini refigrater would be a nice addition also. And more then one towel would have been nice. Elevator card redears were not functioning also in west tower.
10,This Casino is really going downhill. The state of my room upon check in was absolutely horrific. Do not pay for the self parking unless you want to call the front desk every time you can’t get into the gate.
10,Over priced for an outdated room. The carpet was filthy receptionist was rude parking is overpriced shower drain overflowed room smelled like cigarette smoke and the air conditioning did work properly. DO NOT STAY at this hotel!
30,Whilst the hotel main areas are okay the rooms leave you a little disappointed we were in a tower room (most recently refurbished) but the room was a tad on the tired side. Stained carpet shower cubicle leaked.  Bed however was extremely comfortable.    Had issues with cancelled flights on New Year’s Day and the staff were not interested in helping us trying to find a bus or car hire really unhelpful and dismissive of our plight. Very poor customer experience.
50,Went to las vegas to visit family and to see what has changed since our last visit 15 years ago. We where amazed to see everything. The Luxor was a perfect place to be. It has a great location with a walkway to the new stadium. And easy parking for guests or alternate parking for the stadium. We'll be staying there again.
50,We were at Luxor to celebrate our son’s birthday we were all very satisfied with the whole experience  We are already planning a summer vacation  It has been a very pleasant stay at this wonderful hotel
40,The openness was different. Musical sounds on the ground floor can be heard to the 10th and probably higher. It felt like an older hotel that has gone through upgrades to compete with the more opulent hotels higher on the strip. The bed was comfortable.
20,Check in went great expected to get a StayWell room when we up graded base on photo shown. Did receive that thay put in a stay well but filters need to be changed took 3 times asking. We stayed 3 nights. Communication was awful for restort credits how it is to be used etc.
40,I stayed there for a trade show at the Mandalay convention center. The location was great staff was friendly and the rooms were clean. I really did not spend a lot of time in the room - but slept well on the comfortable beds.
50,Check in was packed to the gills but still only took something like 20 minutes. Really nothing. The room itself was spacious the AC worked great but the room lacked a fridge. Also the view both from the balcony near the door and the window were great.
30,Our overall stay was pleasant. The bed and amenities in our room were nice and elegant and I did not notice any significant filth. However I should mention that the carpet in the room is outdated and the carpet outside is dirty and at times ripped and ugly. The casino floor is nice though I thoroughly enjoyed my gaming experience.
50,My wife and I were returning from a visit with her family over the Christmas holiday and decided to stop in Las Vegas. We selected Luxor because we had never stayed there. Valet parking luggage handling and check in were all quick efficient and friendly. The only down side was the M Life desk said we had free parking but it most certainly wasn't.
20,We stayed here in 1994 when it first opened....now it could not be more different. The quality has dropped off a cliff. Having said that it probably still represents good value for money and a unique experience for anyone wanting to try staying in a pyramid shaped hotel. It is not expensive and it is busy....so it has atmosphere. The structure of the building is still very impressive but it is now full of cheapness.
40,Beds need to be updated no support. Maybe another tower had newer ones. Traveled for 2 weeks at hotels and this seemed to be the worst bed. Whoever did the caulking in the shower area did a poor job. We were happy with everything else at casino restaurants.
10,this was the worst experience ever..consistent though...customer service was horrible..rooms were a complete mess..never got accomidated with nessecities like hand soap towels nothing...tv did not work ..i complained 3 times and nobody ever came to fix these issues..and your casino was a ripoff..the whole time i was there not 1 person won anything just took everybodys money...crooks
40,Great price check in was efficient. Housekeeping did Great job. Loots of restaurants with excellent food. Casinos had lots of games and betting. Rooms were spacious lots of adventure and sight seeing
30,I have stayed at the Luxor in the past and will stay again due to the fact that I am a season ticket holder for the Raiders. Typically this is a great hotel. However my recent stay was less than stellar. I was put in what appeared to be a construction area in the back of the 1st floor (1028). The hallways were filthy with debris housekeeping bags from the previous day and a disgusting latex glove that remained on the hallway floor for the duration of the 5 days I was there. My room was also not cleaned after my 1st nights stay even though it was vacant from about 10am to 4pm. Finally after the 2nd night's stay it was cleaned.
20,Besides being a filthy room we were greeted with water that was cold before we went on a date our first day of arrival. Keep in mind this was at 5PM. Why would the water be cold? The room was very dirty even through it was an updated premium room. We had a nice view of the mountains and parking garages but being on the 30th floor we could barley sleep with the sound of whatever machine was above our heads turning off and on all night. Also the elevator or lift machine is a shaky nightmare. This hotel is fun don’t get me wrong but for a honeymoon which is where I picked to stay you might want to shell out a little more for better quality stay over all. I’ve heard the tower rooms are nice there but there was no tub which is what my wife and I wanted 🤷‍♂️
30,When I checked in the hotel staff was minimally staffed and I was not helped that much. I asked about some of the shows and I wasn't given any information or where I could go the concierge desk was empty every time I checked. The worst part was opening the dresser drawers and finding marijuana in there which led me to question the cleanliness of the room. They offered me a new room but I didn't feel like moving that late at night. There was no safe and where there was a safe the door was barely hanging on and there was an empty hole. The shower glass is not enough to keep the water from pooling on the bathroom floor. The casino was fine and the buffet was legit.
20,- No conditioner available  - No room service  - No fridge in the room    The overall experience was not a good value. For the same price I could have stayed at any hotel that offers the above amenities. It was a weekend and the tables were all full and we had to walk around looking for free tables which took a long time to open up.
40,Booked for a long weekend to find out it doesn't include resort fees plus another $50 a night deposit a night. Found this out at check in. Otherwise a decent room if you only plan to sleep and relax after sightseeing. Wife disappointed there was no tub. Pools closed in January.
20,Stayed in pyramid for raider game this past weekend. Stuck in elevator a couple times. Outlets in room above desk kept falling out of wall. No hot water in shower. Sink drain closed and wouldn't drain but that issue was fixed. 50/50 on rude to helpful employees.in my opinion food was very expensive for our first Vegas trip in our opinionespecially in the current state of our country.Atmosphere was greatstructure not so much. But that is only mine and my wife's experience/opinion. May be different for others.
10,Well this was not what I would call an amazing experience at the Luxor. First time at Luxor... The following were my personal experiences.    1)There was LONG hold times to get to the front desk (20 plus Minutes)  2) The outlets were broken/worn out( I had trouble keeping my chargers connected)  3) The soda machine by the ice maker had warm sodas  4) You only give ONE bar of soap...Most hotels give a bar to wash your hands and a separate bar for the shower.  5) No coffee pot in room.  6) No refrigerator in room.
50,Our stay here at the Luxor is always a great time the staff is always friendly the housekeeping always do a job keeping the rooms clean and they do a awesome job when we call for towels or anything else we might need
40,If you’re a raider fan and this is a hotel you must stay at. Awesome atmosphere great vibe and the staff was amazing. My only downfall was the room air conditioner did not work we did not complain because we were just there for a night. But definitely going there for every can’t wait!!!
40,Girlfriend & I were trying to do Vegas for a few days for as cheap as possible. Luxor was a nice stay for a pretty good price compared to some of the other rates further down the strip. Booking at least a month or 2 in advance is good advice since the prices increase as the time comes closer. Luxor is cheaper than other hotels because it doesn’t have as much of an indoor ambience as the other hotels and is not very close to the main sections of the Strip so you’ll have to either walk a lot or pay for rides to and from the hotel. Besides a couple very minor maintenance quirks we really enjoyed our stay and managed to stay under our intended budget.
10,Time for an upgrade at all levels. Dirty and unkept. Location is good but that is about it. It has seen good times before. Not sure I will ever go back. Oh ... the steak at their Public House restaurant was a good bang for the buck. Very tasty.
30,We stayed 3 nights and the staff was either rude or just inconsiderate from the front desk to the shops and stores inside the hotel. Considering the money we paid per night and the cost of food and drinks we were really disappointed and not stay there again
50,Ha had a marvelous time the hotel is beautiful it is big it is lovely but the idea that the pyramid corner suite did not have a microwave in it that kind of blew me but beyond that everything else was marvelous
50,This place is awesome! Rooms are a bit dated but has all of the needed amenities. The check in process was fast on the app and loved being able to make my own room keys. Lots of convenient stores and they make it easy to charge it to the room.
30,There was nothing wrong with the hotel itself however the restaurants and food and vending areas were not available throughout the day they closed very early which made it to where you had to leave the hotel in order to get something to eat. The vending machines in the hotel area did not work.
50,What an amazing experience overall the check in was super easy and so was checking out. I had no problems at all. I would recommend staying here again. It was also so easy to go to the raider game as we just had to walk over the bridge.
40,Great Value. Bad room location. The room had no shower towels ask for an extra pillow prior to checking in and didn't receive that either. But overall experience was fine. Just the room was very loud. In the very corner. And didn't receive any of the requests but not a big deal only stayed for 1 night.
40,Overall was a good experience. Slightly underwhelming compared to other resorts on the strip. It could probably use an update. But everything was clean and staff was friendly and helpful! Would recommend this place
50,The Luxor did not disappoint. Check in and check out were fast. There's was a ton of stuff to do that almost didn't require us leaving the facility. The staff was friendly and attentive. Just wish I won a jackpot in the casino. Then again...you have to play to win. We will be coming back!!!
30,Rooms in pyramid were sub par. Would not stay again. I would gamble in the casino. I was however intrigued by the ‘inclinator’ elevator. I know that there is a new section but would opt out of staying at the Luxor.
20,No fridge in my room. No complimentary bottle water. I purchased some when I realized there was no water.  MGM did not honor $30 Food & Beverage credit per night. Waitress were great at providing drinks in a timely manner while we played. The Public restaurant and food court had great service.    Several people outside were arguing almost fighting after the game and no security anywhere. My family felt unsafe that we went inside to avoid any drama.
20,The trip was raw the staff was raw and opionated room moderate clean no water no fridge and I was treated like a vagrant and was not happy about ot lost my phone on a machine and security wouldn't help
50,Excellent staff and ease of checking in and out online. Valet parking a bit pricey but The Luxor Hotel rates 5 stars! The staff handled the Chargers v Raiders and most restaurants stayed open late. Thank you to everyone!
10,Sewers plumbing needs work. Two people only got 3 pillows.  Poor internet connection. Inadequate capabilities for electronic device charging. Toilet had to be flushed several times before it would empty.
40,Quick trip good experience quick check in got into our room quickly close to everything Uber ride area very convenient room was really nice and clean only issues with room was shower set up and water gets all over floor heater wasn’t working very well.
30,For a few hundred dollars the hotel is fine definitely old AC was broken the day we arrived to our room six hours later it finally started working finding the room was awful signs are not easy to find
30,Convenient hotel on the strip. The good: The Titanic exhibit and Blue Man Group were both well worth the cost. The food ambiance and service at the onsite steakhouse Tender were awesome! We arrived during the week and enjoyed the less crowded more low-key environment. The bad: We had problems with our room heat which kept resetting to 65 degrees. Sleeping was a challenge when once every hour or two it was necessary to jump up and reset the thermostat in order to stop shivering under the thin covers. The shower had awesome water pressure but it had no door so every time we showered the bathroom floor ended up with big puddles of water on it. Although we paid for self-parking our room keys never worked the parking gate - even after we had them remade. Every time we left the site we had to call someone to operate the gate remotely. It was doable but an unnecessary hassle. By Saturday night the casino was filled with a younger crowd and it was very noisy.
40,Great spur of the moment trip. Great place to stay. Love all Starbucks inside and great late night food court. High pressure shower make sure you put a couple mats down. Little scary on the rickety elevators. We would definitely stay again.
50,RaiderNation showed out in Vegas baby all day everyday let's get it!!! Playoff bound watched one of the greatest games the NFL ever produced... Raiders lose everything is a 1 star lolol they win it's all 5 stars
30,We stayed at Luxor right after Christmas this year. The staff was friendly. The first room we had hadn't been cleaned. There were drinks in the fridge and the bathroom was a mess. Walking to the room the wall paper was falling off the wall. We got a new room an upgrade (I guess? Only thing that seemed like an upgrade was that we weren't in the pyramid) but at least this one was clean. But we lost out on having a fridge. Will probably not be staying at Luxor when I return.
30,The bathroom shower needs a closing door as the water runs out and one can easily fall on the floor. The bar should offer top shelve when playing at minimum a $1 but they only offer complimentary well drinks.
10,The elevators are very unsafe the best and pillows were very uncomfortable. We woke up with backpack and a stiff neck. The digital key didn't work. I was charged for parking but neither the barcode or the key worked so I had to pay again.
50,This was my first time in vegas. Really interesting hotel. nice ambiance. All in one place. Easy to digital checkin so can avoid big lines at hotel and also easy access to room. Enroll into Mlife rewards give access to most of benefits.
10,The place is falling apart. Specifically the elevators. Unbelievable to me that the state hasn’t shut this place down. The elevators have loose panels exposed wire non-functioning floor displays incorrectly functioning floor display tally light burnt out card readers that don’t work. I was just there last October it was the same way then. You don’t care about the safety of your customers.  Furthermore No air ventilation in the rooms. The heaters have no adjustment other than on and off. The temperature control knobs were broken too. Also there were many homeless roaming the food court in the Luxor and excalibur. One homeless wanted to eat dinner with my group and try to sit with us
20,Service was great in the overall casino; restaurants tables bars bell service and front desk. My room was apparently remodeled. However the shower tub seemed dirty due to the black stains and mold. There were no clocks in the room and the room service was unavailable. There wasn't even coffee in the room - had to get dressed and wait in a long Starbucks line for coffee in the morning.
40,The customer service was outstanding in all areas. We had our shower break but was serviced and completed within 45 minutes. Wish it were more towards the middle of the strip but that is a minor setback. The food court food was not good but all the other food places were fantastic. All the coffee was hot!
10,Water wouldn’t drain after taking a bath there was a used condom sitting on the drain from prior guest. TV also didn’t work. Staff offered room change or said someone would come fix it. We opted to have it looked at and no one showed up
10,The place is dirty and falling apart. Service.. meh. Value. Meh. Food was OK at best but really expensive. Staff was very small and not that friendly. At least a super eight would have a coffee maker in the room and a continental breakfast
40,Nice accommodations room is a bit noisy since its facing the airport    Room is nice but the bed is too soft and only three pillows.    A little stingy with the towels in the bathroom so that was a bit of a disappointment    Over all a good stay
50,If you are in Vegas and looking for stay at the BEST... Luxor is the Place. Clean resort staff is very nice and friendly. The comforts of a great spacious room is here. The Food options are the BEST.. My Favorite is Public House. I will always stay here.
20,Came to vegas with friends and family for my 40th birthday for New Year! We expected a crowd and for it to be busier than usual. The hotel is pretty much the same as it’s always been but service this weekend was TERRIBLE! I didn’t get my hotel room cleaned the entire 5 days I was there. I had to come out and ask for towels when I heard the housekeeper on the hall! I tried calling the desk and the phone just rang snd rang! When I did ask the housekeeper in the hall for service to my room she was very rude snd said “I can’t clean your room I have too many check outs” then she slammed the door to the room she was cleaning! I couldn’t even go to the desk and report it the lines were awful!
20,Stayed in the towers and room was nice. Was my 21st birthday so staff were nice enough to upgrade my room which was nice - my friend was staying in the pyramid and hated it. I had my iPhone 13 and passport stolen in the hotel casino and staff did absolutely nothing to help I spoke to three different managers and no one could care less. As a 21 year old girl who was half way across the world this was an extremely scary experience so be careful with your belongings if staying here. Staff could not understand me and acted as if I was speaking a different language but I’m English so don’t understand the issue - if I return to Las Vegas I would stay somewhere further into the strip as it was a taxi journey to most places which was around $30 each time
10,My bag was stolen from my room the staff was not really empathic at all. The hotel is rundown. The manager put me in another room but was not empathic at all. The cell key entry was not working sometimes as the hotel didn't have good reception.
10,Pyramid rooms need to be updated. Mattress spring was bad. The showers leak water on the floor with a poor design. Furniture definitely outdated. I wonder if this is going to be the future Allegiant stadium parking lot. If staying here only stay in the tower.
20,Trap elevators that randomly get stuck.    Pyramid rooms feel like straight out of 2022 B.C.    Incline elevators resemble pyramid traps from Indiana Jones. Complete with trap doors missing buttons and randomly takes you to a mystery floor.
10,Just awful to much to list. Room was dirty. I requested connecting room for handicap purpose. The towel smells. Room smell. Room service knocked on my door and ask me when I was leaving at 9am when my checkout is 11am that day.
40,Great time definitely check in on the app and save tons of time and you won't have to wait in a line for over a hour. Love the pyramid shape tho and the casino was very spaced out and welcoming even tho I lost all my money lol
20,I have had good experiences in this hotel in the past so this was very unexpected. I understand that some things are out of your control but some compassion for a trouble would’ve been nice. I would like to 1 day return and have the good experience that we I had hoped for and expect from what was one of my favorite casinos in Las Vegas
10,The room was amazing but it was a mess we found old food in the fridge old limes under our tv stand drugs (yes real drugs) around the room staff was rude. I couldn’t get in contact with a host for anything the buffet was ok but the food wasn’t all that good.
10,I booked a room for my nieces 21st birthday and was very sad to hear her tell me that there was mold in the bathroom no standard coffee pot no mini fridge the elevators were constantly filthy and the monorail wasn’t operational when they tried to use it. Very bummed that this was her first experience at a Las Vegas strip property. I would definitely not book a room here again.
50,The rooms are nice and big. Bed was very comfortable. The maid did an awesome job cleaning our room and even left us bottled water. Atmosphere of the casino is welcoming. Good restaurant choices. It’s not centrally located but it was perfect weather to walk the strip.
50,Wedding weekend with my new wife. We had a great time and even when things went wrong the staff took care of us. I also liked how easy it was to check in. The phone app is amazing. They did a great job.
30,Rooms are so so. Not very clean. Common areas are not clean either. Staff are friendly but they are short handed. Front desk does not answer phones. Had a problem with the noise in AC and had to walk down since after 20 min on hold no one answered
50,Always more than expected at the Luxor prompt room service many games/video slots cards and dice tables I will recommend this Hotel and casino for your next visit and I will definitely return to this location for future visits
30,Luxor is amazing and has lots of unique qualities to keep your mind and eyes in awe. The staff is friendly and the games are good. I cannot comment on the dinning facilities as I didn't dine at the Luxor. The sports book and the bar located across are primo!
40,We got a great deal on the room which made me nervous that the hotel was going to be run down. On the contrary it we very well maintained. We were only there for a stop over but we would stay there again and hopefully do more exploring around the hotel property.
10,The room we checked in was smelly and it was so easy to notice and the staffs could have not given the room. It was provided regardless. Changed to a new room but it was a long walk to this new room on a new year night. Spent most of the time walking between rooms
20,There were only 3 front desk personnel working to check in quests. Took over an hour waiting in line to check in. Additionally we were given a special needs room which the shower was not mounted on the wall. It was ridiculous to shower having to hold the shower head. Finally maintenance feels the need to bang on pipes and the walls at 8 in the morning so the sleep quality was bad. This was booked through Hyatt website which we still haven't received our points for the stay.
20,There was a construction debris container parked outside of our room to capture the leaking water from a ceiling access panel. The service person who attempted to make a water leak repair on 1/3/22 failed to check his work and didn't return! Also please find a piece of furniture to house the refrigerator. Placing it on the carpet is just tacky.
50,Check in on my phone was a breeze. My room was ready before noon.. The room was very nicely updated. Everything seemed to be brand new. Sparkling clean. Decent service and good food at several of their restaurants. Would definitely stay there again.
30,The dog relief areas are too far from the room. It was hard to keep the dogs from going potty while taking them that distance. You should put people with dogs in rooms close to their dog bathroom spots so that the distance is minimized.
50,Luxor has been my hotel of choice on numerous trips to Vegas. Always clean rooms friendly and helpful staff and plenty of gaming choices. I like the location as well easy access to other properties and transportation.
40,My stay at Luxor was great i didn’t have to wait in the long line because I was able to check in at the kiosk which made my room available to me much quicker. The front desk representatives were very helpful as well.
50,My wife and I enjoyed the room and friendly staff and for the price you just can't beat it.  our room was always clean and well taken care of. We will be back for sure. The Casino was good and the food was amazing as well.  We had a great experience there while the NFR was going on.
40,Every time we travel to Vegas we always choose the Luxor. We always have great service from check in to check out. The beds are comfortable and rooms very clean. Our last visit was Dec '21 we were comfortable with the safety precautions put in place. We will be staying here on our next visit to Vegas
50,The rooms very clean and staff very helpful Highly recommend. Will definitely stay here again for future trips. Restaurants clean and staff very courteous to my needs. I especially enjoyed the shows and the casino.
50,I always stay at Luxor and have a great time. Room was clean and ready very quickly. Staff is friendly and helpful with questions. Enjoyed eating at the cafe and other restaurants in the hotel. I would recommend Luxor fir your next stay.
40,Our stay at the Luxor was wonderful! We had a nice room and it was very convenient since we saw the America's Got Talent show. Plus we ate at two restaurants in or near the Luxor and they were wonderful!
50,Took my boyfriend for his birthday(first time in Vegas) and it was such a great hotel to stay at for our first night there we absolutely loved how easy it was to check in and check out of the hotel. We will be looking forward to booking again!
10,The bathroom was filthy to the point I  felt there’s a possibility I would not shower. The tub I was looking forward to the most only to discover residue toothpaste and hair outlining the inside of the tub. There was trash underneath the frame of the bed and the room had a stagnant smell. I had a better experience in old town then at an overpriced casino on the strip. Really disappointed!
40,An amazing hotel and casino. Stayed in the pyramid and the rooms could use a little TLC. Rooms showed a little wear and tear and the hallways were a little dusty. Other than that this place was amazing.food was great drinks were strong and the slots were loose. What else do I need to say? Will be staying here again soon hopefully when the weather's better so me and my husband can enjoy the pool.
50,Had a good time very clean and up beat environment a good place to be. i have a very good time Diablo bar is very assume Margaritas and appetizers. Body Exibits is also very cool and interesting. Casino can I say more FUN FUN FUN!!!!
50,Had a great time at Luxor. Nice clean room. Very friendly staff that went above and beyond. Great restaurants. Titanic exhibit was really cool to experience. Massage at Nurture Spa was amazing. Will definitely stay again.
50,Food court is good. Building design & decoration is really attractive. Need little improvement in rooms like cleaning & microwave if possible. Overall experience was good. Close to the airport & good location
40,Felt very safe with the covid protocols in place I saw security hand people who weren’t wearing masks and politely tell them to wear them or they had to leave. Clean facilities and nice staff. Glad they were concerned about the virus.
50,I was very pleased with my stay. Excellent customer service. My room was very clean and the hotel was very nice! Beautiful Egyptian theme. Whenever I am in Las Vegas again I’ll definitely would stay at The Luxor. Thank you.
10,Do your self a favor and book any other hotel. If you want a bang for your buck check the MGM Grand. Luxor is cheaper but the small difference in price does not make up for the quality difference. Luxor has a stench in the room everything is dirty and seems like no one cleans a thing there. The walk to anything on the strip even just getting to the strip alone makes it not worth it let alone the terrible quality the hotel provides us with.
50,when my friend and i had a little bit of an issue with his members card at a slot machine myriam approached us and asked if everything was okay and if we needed further assistance... she nicely showed us what we we were doing wrong and fixed our issue she was a great individual with a fabulous personality. we eventually continued to chat while my buddy gambled. overall she took care of us in a fast manner and this is why mgm resorts needs more and more myriams' from the slots department around. thank you.    - rq
10,To be brief Luxor was in a state of disrepair. The elevators were falling apart the panels on them were falling off showing the electrical switches. The hotel smells like sewage which is incredibly pervasive everywhere you go the smell follows. It was generally just not well maintained we got stuck in the elevator for about a minute then the doors decided to open.
10,My room was very dirty. I requested new towels and bedding which was brought to the room at 2AM! I requested a billing statement which showed zero additional charges but my credit card was charged $260 by Luxor without authorization or any explanation. You always just get automated messages and are referred to online submittal. Where is customer service???
40,We stayed here for one night only. If you don't want valet parking you have to walk A LOT to get from the parking lot to the front desk. And you will walk through people smoking in the casinos. The check in line was huge and slow moving because there were very few people checking guests in. The people at the counter were nice. We had reserved a room in the pyramid but we ended up getting a room elsewhere which was very disappointing. You have to pay for parking even if you sleep there.    The room itself was dated and okay.
20,Not the best experience at the Luxor. Rooms were dated. the parking experience lacked in many ways. I checked into the Luxor via the phone app which went pretty smooth. However once we arrived in the Luxor and particularly in the parking garage the internet connectivity was terrible. I have Verizon so it wasn't the carrier. Our parking pass was on the app and there were a few times that I could not access the parking pass so had to park the car and walk because we couldn't get out of the parking garage. This was very frustrating. I think others experienced the same as it took forever for 3 to 4 cars to exit the garage. I would not stay here again.
10,The worst trip ever scam. So I paid for the most expensive room available when I get there no one informed me that they were going to change my room or inconvenienced me I arrived New Year’s Eve after three delayed flights was extremely tired and late for the festivities I just put my luggage down and left I flew all the way from New Jersey no running hot water my last day there toenail clippings on the carpet pubic hair in the Jacuzzi dogs barking all night went to go eat in the Buffet I counted more than eight dogs there scattered throughout the restaurant if that is not a health sanitation and cleanliness hazard I don’t know what is tried to reach out to management and basically they keep giving me emails to contact but yet I never got a response back the worst place ever I usually stay at the Bellagio wanted to try this hotel out the worst mistake ever
40,My stay was very pleasant. My friend's room was broken into while we were attending a show so be wary of security. Disappointed with MGM that the David Copperfield show was cancelled without notice. To their credit they booked us for another show.
50,Luxor was amazing. You could stay here and never leave. Plenty to do for adults teens and younger kids. Staff very friendly. Hubby loved that he could smoke in the casino area. Only downside was price of snacks at the convenience store.
50,When I stayed at Luxor hotel the environment was amazing and the staff was nice and friendly. Also the room that I stayed in was clean and the room cleaner were fast and made the environment of my room feel like I was home. Also when I met the host he was nice and say that he would give me a discount the next that I would come . If you have not come to this hotel I 10/10 recommend it to your friends and family.
10,To start with the room we stayed in you could hear people in the other rooms next door very loud also people would be hollering from there balcony during the night and it would echo back into our room. For some reason when the heat would run it would smell like burnt toast. The second night we stayed there we woke up too a fire alarm going off but there was no fire. There was a water main that broke so we lost our water pressure and part of our power went out of our room. So we left our room and went down to the front desk and they decided to move us to the tower rooms. When we got to our new room it was much nicer but the heat did not work so we waited for a technician to come up and repair it. First two nights pyramidlast night tower. No more nights planned in future.
50,I stayed for one night. Easy check in and out using app on my phone. Easy to open door using app. Bed and pillows were very comfortable. Only suggestion is to put in USB ports in case you forget or don’t have an AC plug.
40,I had a great stay as usual at the Luxor. I needed to check in early and the 1st person at the desk did her best and gave me a reference number and said to go to VIP after an hour or so. We went and had breakfast at the Pyramid Cafe ( my fav) and came back. There was a room! The only downside was the rude people at the bell check who kept yelling at us for not knowing their job ( I don't do this every day you do).Other than that a great visit.
50,This is the second time staying at this location. The hotel is very nice and clean. The staff are very friendly and knowledgeable. I would defiantly recommend the hotel to family and friends for future stays.
40,Room could have been cleaner. The minute we walked in there was a strange smell bathroom glass door wasn’t cleaned well and furniture wasn’t wiped well. Receptionist could of share other commodities in hotel we had to walk around to find places and services offered.
30,What made my stay average was the customer service from the cleaning crew ladies. As for the room itself was expensive so they said they remodels the rooms but now: NO Fridge NO Coffee pot NO Microwave Not even a pen and a sheet of paper and MOST important NO SHOWER DOOR.  How can you even dare to say they remodels the rooms when most of the basic amenities have been removed.    But yes of course they raise the price to the top    SO MY STAY WAS LESS THAN AVERAGE.    YES I WILL PASS THE WORD TO LET EVERYONE NOT TO STAY AT THIS HOTEL / CORPORATION UNLESS THINGS CHANGE........
20,This hotel needs a lot of work room has a lot of work elevators needs repairs… service average not bad but would could be better to at least lift the hotel experience…. I would not recommend this hotel to my of my friends
10,The couch in my elite suite was as dirty as you can imagine. The water was disgusting. My bathtub was broken and so was the couch and my bed. This was a horrible experience. I reserved one of the best rooms in the building and was completely let down
50,Enjoy the wonderful stay in a clean safe environment. Plenty of amenities nice food court and plenty of Starbucks The staff was friendly and courteous. I felt welcomed and appreciate it. And will return again
40,Too much smoke for it to be kid friendly the check in staff was nice but the checkout staff not so much. Smoke almost gave me an asthmatic attack. I know you can smoke inside but how can a non smoker like me who spends money very well sit at a game table with 4-5 people smoke a cigarette each person I can’t even enjoy it. Thin about the people who don’t smoke nicotine & especially around foods
40,It’s a giant pyramid shaped hotel with a casino in it. What more do you expect!    Easy to get to from the airport but right at bottom of the strip which is both good and bad. It’s a giant hotel and like the rest of the mega venues on vegas it lacks any sense of intimacy or personal touch. But it’s great and does what it says on the tin!
40,My stay was really great the hotel is really big you don’t hear anyone or the craziness that’s down stairs which is nice. The room was nice and clean the heat worked which was good since it was a bit cold in Vegas in December
20,Wall paper falling off in large sections (2 foot by 2 foot) in the hall leading to our room. Room was not very clean water marks where drinks had been on table and night stand reusable glasses had finger prints and water marks on inside and outside. Shower door would not open and clos properly you had to lift it up to get it to function. A dog was barking down the hall.
50,It was my first time visiting Las Vegas. We had a wonderful experience.    Our only complaint is about the buffet the meat was cold.    Everything else was excellent. Very impressed. Planning on going back.
50,Loved our stay at Luxor. Preferred place to stay while in Vegas. We saw Carrot top at the Luxor and loved the show. Will definitely go back to see him. The room was spacious and clean and the beds are super comfortable
50,"I ordered a hamburger fries chicken quesadilla and mr pibb. My son ordered a hamburger 2 chicken bacon ranch wraps and mr pibb. Each meal was $6.25 before tax. Only ""need for improvement was a little bit more chicken in the quesadilla""  Thank you for the memory. I ate with my son his first meal in his first apartment."
20,No microwave coffee maker in the room. Plus we had no hot water when we checked in in the evening. Plus if there is football game you will have a hard time finding parking...or getting to your hotel.
10,The rooms are dated and you will get the smell of cigarette smoke even in a non smoker room. The elevators are extremely shaky and unstable honestly anxiety ridden. Plus someone from the staff may pop into your room unannounced even if you have the DO NOT DISTURB sign up. Would NEVER recommend! There are soooo many better options on the strip and we ended up choosing this one from lack of knowledge.
10,Terrible experience  Plumbing was bad room stunk of sewer  Someone entered my room at 1240 am while I was asleep    Bugs on the counter    Iiiiiiiiiiiiiiii iiiiiiiiiiiii iiiiiiiiiiiii iiiiiiiiiiiiii  Hated hated hated  This this this  Stay stay stay
10,General area of casino and internal areas is nice enough but rooms are disgusting. Paid extra for a corner suite and didn't help. Broken furniture. Mold above shower. Broken floor tiles next to tubs. Poorly cleaned and sticky fridge. Broken bathroom door. Staff is impossible to get ahold of. No hot water for multiple days
40,Easy check in and check out as well. Staffs were helpful and friendly. Great room services even though under Covid. I didn't have my room serviced in NY and Miami earlier this year. I was surprised.
40,Nice hotel! Could use an upgrade on slip and slide shower and need faster elevators! The tub could use some jets! 5 days and never a host on duty! Was helped at MLife Rewards but didn’t get anywhere until I went back and found Ishala who told me about the promotions I had that I didn’t get when I first arrived since the first associate didn’t advise me properly!
50,Everything was clean staff friendly plenty food options on the strip of vegas were everything is enjoyed the show cases room was big house keeping great as well as the service within the hotel enjoyed my stay will be back
30,We had issues the whole stay with our shower drain and water almost overflowed. Have to turn off water to allow water to drain. Also Guest Services made statements that issues with parking fee will be resolved as an M Life Member with complimentary parking privileges but never did.
50,Perfect strip location great slots FANTASTIC restaurants all at an incredible value. So much fun. The room was a little outdated it was a corner king suite that we expected to be very nice but we were disappointed there. That being said we slept great!
50,"Luxor is an great place to stay for a family trip! There is plenty to do fun shows nearby such as Blue Man Tournament of Kings Copperfield and more. It is also near a lot of great ""affordable"" shopping. This is our 2nd stay as a family and we have stayed at many hotels on the strip. Luxor provides a lot to do especially if you have kids and are on a budget! Also the beds are very comfortable! I recommend the Two Queen Suite with Tub in the room!"
30,Don't think I would ever stay here again you're again the parking lot and the bridge To the hotel with filthy and smelled like urine. I was harassed by a homeless homeless gentleman on my way to the bridge. My room did not have a working heater and it was 30ﾟ that night...all I was offered was 2 extra blankets
10,I chose this hotels because I read all the reviews and I see was almost very positive . But wasn’t for me . Never staying or recommend this property no any one or my colleagues .. 😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡
10,Me and my fiancé lay in the bed before enjoying a night on the town . We wake up he has lint in his hair and all over his clothes. I called the front desk put me on hold came back and said we can send his clothes to be dry cleaned but he will not get them back today . The only problem with this was we didn’t bri g extra clothes as we usually do . We take a lot of pictures and didn’t have a extra fit ok . We go down to the front desk the manager ask me how can we make this right I’m like I don’t know . He gave us a $50 food voucher and supposedly 1 resort fee off the room we haven’t seen that as of yet but he never said we will have someone change the sheets and comforter… We come to Vegas 2 twice a year and have always stayed at the Luxor. We stayed our first time in the pyramid and after that The Tower . Some how this year for New Year’s Eve we get the pyramid with lint…
50,We made an overnight visit and the Luxor it’s staff made it very enjoyable and with such a quick trip we didn’t waste any time! I look forward to my next trip and the Luxor will be my first choice. Thank you!
50,Had 3 day break from work headed to VEGAS to play and unwind. Was happy to see a pleasant crowd order everyone wearing a mask. And still I had a great time. Played in comfort people kept their distance and did not mind wearing their mask. Does not impede having a good drink and then eating at the restaurant.
50,Though extremely busy all staff I encountered went above and beyond to provide a very gracious attention to my every need. I will definitely stay here again. Very good value and I would definitely consider staying here again because if the staff
50,Just finished a two week trip at Luxor.  The only building on strip with character. All others are typical square bldgs.  And the staff there was so great. Been there 5 times in 7 years. My bartender in the Aurora bar knew my drink as soon as he saw me. We have in all our trips there only had 1 issue and they fixed it above my expectation.  We will be back soon
50,If you have a chance to see a show we recommend Carrot Top. He was hilarious! Everyone in our party was laughing non stop! We are breakfast at the pyramid cafe and it was delicious. Valet staff were awesome very helpful. No issues or complaints! We will be back.
50,If you have a chance to see a show we recommend Carrot Top. He was hilarious! Everyone in our party was laughing non stop! We are breakfast at the pyramid cafe and it was delicious. Valet staff were awesome very helpful. No issues or complaints! We will be back.
10,The most expensive experience of my life and I’m 53 information on third party was not given as to extra expenses to the hotel staff not understanding money not refundable why would we need to pay for something that should be included in the price that’s like ordering a taco and not getting a shell WTH
30,Parking situation is not good it’s crowded and a long walk to and from hotel. When the Raiders have events. They close out section of Luxor Parking for the event leaving hotel guest driving around for hours til someone leaves.
50,I was there with my 21 year old son for the LV Bowl. We had a great time. The room was clean and the staff was friendly. We got in late so there was no wait for the check-in. That was fortunate because the cell phone app that is supposed to assign a room never did! we arrived at 8pm so I was hoping to go straight to the room. It was fine that I needed to go to the front desk for the room because the line was VERY short. HOWEVER..... We walked by the lobby many times and it is usually a VERY LONG line.
10,our room is not yet ready when we ger to the hotel room it was all messed up dirty and stink! you have to walk from your room to the casino i would never check in here again even if its complimentary!
10,Staff tried to overcharge Was a one day trip turned into all day in line trying to get my money back from someone who somehow makes up things and is in charge of taking peoples money never again will I stay here thank you for a bad trip
10,Very run down hotel and rooms. Our ceiling had water damage everywhere. There were no mini fridges in the rooms for leftovers or beverages. No coffee pots in the room. The elevators were always breaking down. The bathroom turned into a small lake every time the shower was used because there are no doors or curtains and no bath tubs to soak in after walking miles on the strip everyday. To top off the whole bad experience we were woke up at 5am to a fire alarm malfunction on our last night and going off for a good 20 minutes before it was silenced. We had late checkout but got out of there early at 10am because it was so bad.
50,Staffs at the front were super friendly. And the lady who cleaned our room was always kind and asked us what we need. And digital key is so good that I don't even have to worry about forgetting keys to my room.
20,The Luxor was really disappointing. The rooms are very dated which we could live with but they also haven't been cleaned very well in a while. There was a severe sewer smell in the lower levels of the hotel (casino bars etc) that got to be overpowering.
50,The hotel was just an amazing site to see the room was unbelievable I just hated my night couldn’t be longer but I’ll be back in April until then I will be back in April with my daughter and her girlfriend and I won’t her to really enjoy the experience that I did not have!
20,Needs tlc. Outdated rooms. Room stayed hot. When showering the whole bathroom would get wet to the point ceiling would be dripping water . Getting ready with water dropping on your head extremely annoying rooms need a makeover
20,"Paid for a ""premier"" king room and got a room with a roof view no coffee maker fridge or microwave. Called to at least get a coffee maker since the was in the description and we were told ""sorry not all rooms have them"""
40,Family spent Christmas holiday in Vegas. Location by Raiders stadium is nice if you participate but is very busy if you do not attend the game. The rooms were very nice and many renovations are taking place within the hotel. Connections between the Mandalay Bay and Excaliber is nice to try different things.
10,Dirty room. Uncomfortable bed poor amenities and unbelievable wait for guest services and front desk to request anything (over 45 min)!! I coulda spent less time waiting on the DMV line. Asked for tooth paste they said no asked for glasses they said no. Thankfully they were okay sending me clean towels.
10,Booked in the wrong room from the start staff rude to change to requested room. Rooms were not cleaned well mold in showers. Our flight cancelled had to stay another night worst room yet. Pretty sure half-a$$ cleaned messed up bed last person room key still on desk.The worst was the smell of cigarette's /cigar mildew and BO combined. We have never stayed in anything like this before. Usually stay at the Mirage but tried Luxor because family was staying there. Never again.
40,love the staff very helpful and friendly. check in is very slow.  Hotel is a little dated elevators very slow. i would like to see coffee pots and refridgerators in rooms.  the Backstage Deli is absolutely wonderful!!
30,The shower in the room. I don't know how this has been overlooked. It looks beautiful at first sight but upon actually trying to use it it is almost impossible. There is no door and shower head is so big and powerful that it just sprays water all over the bathroom (the entire bathroom) and it doesn't move around so you can't point it away from the opening. Trying to wash is a joke. You can't get away from the water so the soap is spray doff before it even gets on your skin and then is sprayed all over the bathroom as well. There are better ways to design a shower...
20,Rude staff dirty rooms malfunctioning equipment. Good luck trying to get anyone from maintenance to come and fix something. No staff is willing to help. And if the phone works in your room front desk never answers anyway. And don't expect your room to be ready or clean when you arrive
40,Pyramid corner double queen suite was awesome. VERY clean right down to the bathroom grout. Spacious with nice furniture for relaxing. Well maintained and not run down at all. Good housekeeping services. They brought us extra hangers and blankets. The common areas are not as posh as some other hotels but the suite was a lot of bang for your buck. The suite had a larger than average mini fridge and comfortable beds and bedding.
10,The room was not clean upon checking in. Requested my room to be cleaned but was told that they did not have staffing to do so. My room was cleaned once during a 3 day stay. Took 6 hours and multiple requests to receive clean towels.
20,New Years Eve 2022 will not be back for 2023 Staff was not on the same page with each other. Normal folks such as ourselves don't gets comps. Asked for a late check out and was qouted a large amount. Wheb downstairs at the lobby the guest infront of us got compted late check out. We are just a cop and a teacher. not high rollers.
50,This was the first time my friends and I have ever been to Vegas. The Luxor was an amazing place to stay we’re glad we chose this hotel. We seen the blue man group show the last day of our trip at the Luxor as well it awesome highly recommend that show for family or a group of friends.
20,My best opinion would be to describe this as a budget/low-end Las Vegas property. The parking is a disaster inconvenient a moving target for determining what entrances are open and where spaces are located. The guest room while clean and having a reasonable view had bedding worse than many roadside hotels from the 80s. Four small flat pillows beds lacking any modern cushioning tiny wastebaskets and no refrigerator nor microwave. The staff are friendly and the shower was very good.
10,I stayed in three different rooms and all of them had an issue. First was duty the second the faucet was leaking the third the blankets were duty and some insects bited my leg. This was a terrible experience and I used to love this hotel and I used to suggested my family members to stay there.
40,We picked up some family members who flew into Las Vegas from the great white north. Rather than face a long drive back home we decided to stay the night. We got rooms in the actual pyramid which the grandchildren (from the great white north) seemed to like. Very novel. Our room had a good view of the nearby Excalibur and other places in the city. The room was clean quiet and comfortable. I also like the location; we’re close to a lot of other attractions at the south end of The Strip.
50,It was a great overall trip. The parking was easy. The rooms were great. The check in staff was wonderful. We had booked an adjoining room; but they were unable to accommodate this request. All in all we enjoyed our stay.
20,Needs more workers and to have everything running 24 hours of the day just had a bad experience checking in took 40 minutes and my room was switched and I paid the same price  not satisfied with this hotel
30,My husband and I stayed December 26th thru December 29th and someone said in the beginning that I requested no room service when I clicked every Box that said I wanted room service and I requested it every day and set it up and no one ever came and I had to get her on towels clean our room. My husband and I stayed December 26th 3rd December 29th and someone said in the beginning that I requested no room service when I collect every Box that said I wanted room service and I requested it every day and set it up and no one ever came. We has to clean our room and make our bed took 5 hrs to get new bedding and towel 's
50,This is a great location with a friendly staff. Perfect location in walking distance to many properties. Bartenders are the best and the deli has really good food for a low cost. I always stay At the Luxor
40,I liked the rooms clean and with enough space. The only bad part is the line for check in maybe it would be better to have another register open. Customer service was good and I would want to stay at Luxor again thank you.
10,The decor was horrible the food was terrible it was dirty. I can’t think of one good thing to say. I’ve always wanted to stay here and I was so disappointed. I will never stay here again. Just terrible overall. Including the staff!!!
10,Filthy dirty room were not ready for guests. It was for bye family trip and we got stay well double bed 2 rooms and it was so dirty and no towels no shampoo or soap. Shower booth got clogged and water wont drain for hours. They moved us to upstairs and same problem on last day of 2021. They offered to waive resort fee and self parking for ruining whole family’s new year’s vegas trip.  It is piece of xxxx place to stay.
30,No coffee machine in room or vended nearby  No refrigerator in room  Upgraded from cheapest room to 425 sq foot version would expect these amenities that were not present in this room.    Room WAS clean and bathroom was OK
30,Extra comments already added. Hotel is nice. I love Egyptian decor and culture. Everything else is added on what improvements can be done.  Extra lock on door can be useful. Everything else was not bad at all. Very exciting place to be
40,Decent hotel but too many children even on Casino floor. A little walk to get to strip. Facilities were not bad. Great shows available as well as exhibits. We were glad we left on New Year’s Eve as it became very crowded with lots of children throughout the strip area.
50,Very clean updated room great water pressure the bed was not lumpy and the shower was spotless. The mgm app made all aspects of the trio contactless check in check out digital key card made this easy as pie.
10,I had not stayed at this property in Vegas for a about 8 years or so. It also seems to be the last time this property was cleaned. The popcorn ceilings hold more dirt and dust than my 4x4 after a desert run. I am a Raiders fan and was lured by the proximity to the stadium BOY WAS I WRONG! The hour I saved by not commuting to the stadium I paid painfully at check out. I spent hours in a line with about 20-25 guests as there was one employee working the check in desk with about 5 employees looking at him not even cheering him on. The guests expressed frustration to the manager but this only fueled their ability to do anything but work. This was a horrible experience and we’ve lived through COVID so this is saying something. Trust me stay at another property and commute to the game the Luxor is not worth it.
50,Very clean very friendly staff. Well located on the strip and close to the Vegas sign.  Extremely satisfied with the Amenities inside the hotel especially at least 3 Starbucks! :) convenient tram outside  To travel to Mandalay Bay or Excalibur
10,Staff was not friendly at all the entire stay. We had multiple issues and they were unwilling to resolve let alone even acknowledge with any empathy. Seemed very disinterested and not at all focused on the customer.    We also had a room on the third floor with blaring noise throughout the night and it was not another guest it was the hotel.    Overall there are many better options.
10,Luxor used to be our favorite hotel after 2 years of not allowed to travel I was so excited to return to Luxor. Well my experience was very short lived when I seen no hand sanitizer in the lobby or in the casino. My room had black hairs on the bathroom floor even after the second cleaning. Yuck The casino had no wipes for the machines thankfully I brought my own. Security!!! What happened to security there were homeless people walking all through the casino pressing the cash out tickets on the machines I seen this at least 4 times during my visit. So again no one was wiping the machines down and no one was escorting these people that were obviously on drugs. We had to leave a day early due to unexpected issues. The lady at check out basically said to bad you have to pay I always remember Luxor clean kind and happy place to stay.  Sadly we will be moving on to another venue next time.
50,Stayed over Christmas. Rooms were clean and in great condition. Had adjoining rooms and they were spacious. Greeter location. We paid to park at the Luxor for our stay and the parking pass was valid at all MGM resort parkades which was nice if you wanted to go to different locations in the strip you didn’t have to pay extra to park.
40,Luxor is always one of our favorite properties to stay at due to the location and theming. But the one caveat I have has to do with the shower stall. there was no door or curtain so when showering the water simply gets everywhere and basically floods the bathroom floor. not sure what to make of it really. shower only has 1/2 the opening enclosed. But still just a good place to stay.
10,Dirty and old . Need update . Carpet and bedroom are dirty and old . Hard to sleep . Uncomfortable to sleep at night .not friendly staffs for service a drink .I am not back to thi hotel for my next trip.
10,Took over an hour to check in at midnight on a Tuesday. Bathroom ceiling falling in with mold in the vent and shower. Bed just a mattress on a board and very uncomfortable. Staff notified but nothing was done about it. Housekeeping leaves bags of trash and laundry in the hallways all day so navigating the hallways are difficult when people are coming towards you in the hall.
10,I had a one bedroom suite in the east tower which is a far walk. The shower kept flooding it didn't drain . Our ac /heater did not work . We had broken cosmetic mirror in the bathroom.cleaning staff would make the bed but leave the trash . I do have to stay water pressure is awesome.
30,None of the escalator seem to work if you had a broken ankle like my wife you're out of luck the people movers didn't work everything closes at 9 to 10 everybody's trying to hustle you inside the Luxor even the business owned by the Luxor. management doesn't seem to care the food was good Johnny Rockets NOT. The pyramid was fabulous stunningly good.. some Italian place bepos or something like that was really good
50,This was our first time staying at the Luxor the hotel was clean and made checking in very easy! We utilized the digital check in system and got right into our room with out a problem. No lines no waiting and we even got our room 5 hours earlier than check in time! The room was so big we were pleasantly surprised! We will definitely be staying here again! Thank you Luxor!
40,We checked in using the MGM app which saves a lot of time. Got to our suite but it was not what I had reserved. Went back to the lobby to fix the error. I was put to the front of the line but told that because of the NFL game the fight and the rodeo in town the suite I had reserved was not available until the next day. OK great customer service honest mistake. We decided not to change rooms even though we were offer help in moving. The hotel was generous with comps to make up for the suite error. We love this hotel.
20,I understand this is an older casino but there needs to be some down time to deodorize the whole place. From the moment you get close to the hotel all the way to your room there is the smell of Mildew and cigars. This should not be. This casino needs to be thoroughly cleaned and deodorized and have better ventilation and filters installed. I shouldn't smell the cigars from the casino in my hotel room.
30,Waited a while to check in; however we did get upgraded to better room per the employee that checked us in. Bathroom needed a refresh. The tile was chipped outside of the shower and it just looked pretty old and outdated.
20,The room is very small and not as clean as other hotels. The property needs a renovation for sure as the facility and environment look like a motel for me. The self parking is also a headache as you need to walk a long way. I usually stay at Waldorf and Conrad but happened to stay here for just one night as I have never stayed here before and I got a FN from Hyatt to spend. I would not suggest this one.
10,Black water that smelled like sewer bubbled up from our sink at midnight!!! I wish I could post a video. It was like a horror movie. It would go down and bubble up again. Called front desk who called maintenance. Took about 45 min for them to get there. They said they knew the room next to us had a clogged drain and it was backing up into ours. So was that sh!t water? The entire room smelled like sewer. Then he left and called for housekeeping to clean up the remains of the black sh!t water. Took another 45 min. It was a 2 hour ordeal. I didn't factor being up 2 extra hours in my next day driving plans:( Only after complaining did they comp the room. Still had some 30.00 resort fee or something and the 15.00 a day in parking. Pool was closed because December. After working in Las Vegas at a casino I feel they could have done more. I mean when we can stay at any hotel why would we go back there? Also I dreaded the elevators. Shaky and very loud.
10,Very disappointed. Rooms are very dirty and old. Mildew on fixtures. Stains on carpet. Dirty hallways and very crappy elevators. We were given the wrong room after being told that no more were available. Had to book online.
50,We really enjoyed our stay at Luxor. I do like gambling at Luxor and the convenience to Mandalay and the other casinos in the area. Food selections in the area is good. I do wish the cafe stayed opened to later at night.
20,This hotel is aging badly and they don’t care because they continue to make a profit and have rooms booked. If you just want a clean affordable place to sleep its great but other than that go stay at another mgm property.
30,First impressions do count! As you walk up to the grand entrance you are plagued with dog poo and drunk people sleeping in the shrubbery.    As you would expect the reception is elegant but very dated we arrived as a busy period started and had to wait over an hour to checkin. The wait could have been shortened if they utilised all of the available reception points.    My room was large but dirty we found sweets pens and other items lying about the room. The carpet was filthy my wife stood on a sharp tack. The bathroom is old and needs to be modernised.    Most corridors leading to rooms are dirty and need to be derp cleaned the public rest rooms are a disgrace.    The most shocking thing of our whole visit was the price of basic necessities like water expect to pay over $5.00 per bottle. A very very average meal which consisted of a burger 6 chicken wings fries and two sort drinks left my wife and I with little change from $50
40,Luxor has a really cool theme (ancient Egyptian) and the inclining elevators were an interesting experience. One of them rattled quite a bit on our way up but we got up and down safely. We stayed in a premier Queen suite; the room was cleaned daily and our towels and beddings were fixed daily. The room was spacious and clean. Our shower however did not have a door or a towel so water got everywhere on the floor when we used it. Not really sure why they designed it that way. The bed was also way too soft I felt myself literally sunken in. Other than the bed and the lack of a shower door our stay at the Luxor was quite satisfactory.
20,So much to review but stayed 4 days and NEVER once saw anyone cleaning anything literally. Floors were sticky machines were dirty and could not response from any host on site to questions we had. Also got food poisoning for 2 of us out of our group of 3 and only ate at that casino. Was VERY disappointed. Definitely a newer hotel next time and spend a little more money.
40,Exceptional Value. Clean and comfortable stay. Except for housekeeping who said there was no housekeeping service. Our entire 3 nights stay there was no housekeeping who cleaned our room even when I requested housekeeping when I called. Other than that it is a great place to stay.
20,I am a fitness trainer and that was A LOT of walking way to much to ever be considered a vacation  It’s not about the money it’s about getting from the car to my room and how convenient it was?? Thank god I made it the night. It was an experience
20,Expensive and not worth it at all! Find a better hotel to stay in and one that doesn’t have a resort fee! Hotels are ripping people off with these fees and you even have to pay for parking here! So very disappointed!!!!
30,The bed in the room was very stiff and you could feel the coils. Also at one point I had a question but was never able to get through to the front desk. I also tried EVERY single other option but the emergency connection and still did not ever get any live person on the land line in the room. Over all staying there was not the best but their shows aren't too bad.
30,If you like simple this is where you should stay. We stayed in a Tower king room. The decor is various shades of brown beige white and gray with straight and circular lines. Spacious 2 large closets mini fridge outlets near where one sits and sleeps. Room supplied with just one bar of soap no bath mat no extra towels. Housekeeping fulfilled our request for more towels and soap so didn't have to live without for long. Mattress was very firm. Great if you like that but not for me. I awoke with an aching back in the morning. The electronic check-in is nice but you will still have to connect with a casino cashier for any slots credit and with a desk staff person for any meal credits.
30,Rooms are clean and in good working order. Beds were comfortable I slept very well. Cigarette and other smoke were over whelming in the casinos. Mobile check in was confusing. The cell service was spotty and getting the necessary info to come up was slow or timed out constantly. There was no customer service available unless you went to the check in line behind 100 other people.
10,We purchased tickets for the Blue Man 5 pm show on 30 December 2021. When we arrived at 4:25 valet parking was backed up. At 4:50 we were informed that the parking garage was full due to the Las Vegas Bowl ticket holder’s parking in the Luxor garage. When we ask the Valet attendants if we had any options the only one was to purchase a Premium Parking Pass for $40. Given that we had no alternative we did so. We were able to see the start of the show after running to the venue. Afterwards I discovered my credit card was charged $58. They added an $18 daily parking pass to the Premium Parking charge previously quoted. We were robbed; and will never enter the Luxor again! Why were Luxor clients not given priority access to the parking garage?
40,Luxor has always been a cozy place for my wife and I to stay at.  Only issue we had this time around was our pillows giving us upper back pain/soreness. Oh and I guess this was more particular to our room but our toilet area smelled a bit too.  That did affect our overall stay but everything else was pretty nice. Staff was friendly. Hotel (the rest) was nice and always clean. Everyone pretty much followed cdc guidelines versus California which is great.
20,Arrived early. Room was not ready which I expected. My issue was being told room may not be ready by check in time. However a more expensive room was available. So I took the more expensive room which by the way had no fridge
10,1st time in last time I will overstay there were service I had to ask for my shoots to get changed after all night of me smelling nothing but smoking cigarettes which means my shoes were never cleaned which I can only imagine how they are cleaning their rooms check in and check out service system is horrible they make you wait in line the next day if you happen to mix tender trip to reach change out keys and you still have to wait in line in the extra hour or whatever time period the wait time is there's no Customer service immediately etc.
20,Trash left from previous guests between bed and wall shower not mounted on wall. Very poor check in as lines were long and only 3 people working the front desk. Maintenance felt the need to bang on pipes and working at 8am
40,I liked Luxor and would stay here again however I didn’t like that there was a roach in my room and stains on the sheet which made me feel dirty and uncomfortable sleeping there. Aside from that I really enjoyed this location.
10,"Front desk staff were rude upon arrival. Waited 30+ minutes for Bell hop. Went to front desk to request early check-in so we'd have a place to put our bags was treated very disrespectful by staff and told that I would not be getting early check-in and I would need to wait in line after 3:00pm like everyone else (even though I paid for early check-in and had checked in already on my phone).    Original room was absolutely filthy dirty unvacuumed floors dirty surfaces (cup rings dust crumbs) and stained imprinted dirty sheets.    When brought to staff attention staff member apologized that it wasn't ""up to my standards"" and claimed it was an accident. Our room was switched to an ""excellent upgrade"" and I was sent on my way with incorrect but very specific directions to the wrong elevators.    Our ""excellent upgrade"" had a thermostat that would not shut off for longer than 5 minutes. The room stayed between 79 and 84 degrees regardless of settings. After three hours of trying to cool the room enough to sleep I called the front desk. No answer after several minutes (no answer when calling from original room earlier either). Walked to front desk and asked to speak to manager and was threatened by female security officer along the way to be escorted off the property for not wearing mask. I explained that I had washed my mask and it was soaking wet hanging in my room that I didn't have one but would take one. She didn't care and proceeded to threaten me as I walked away.    When asked for a manager at front desk I was told I could stand in the seriously long line like everyone else and wait my turn. I refused since I was already checked in... (the two girls at bell hop were too busy chatting and using their phones to here me out for needing a manager). I was interrupted and told to proceed to the Mlife line instead.    Finally speaking to front desk I received an apology and offered for my early check-in fee to be refunded (funny I was told I wouldn't be charged anyway since you guys weren't allowing early check-in)... I was then offered a resort credit to drink at the bar... refused since I was trying to go to bed. Staffmember told me an engineer would be sent to the room right away to change their settings on the thermostat. I waited for over an hour and a half before finally being woke up by a phone call in the middle of the night to which I answered and nobody was there.    Honestly the worst of MGM properties I have ever stayed at and will NEVER recommend this property to anyone I know."
10,The original room I received did not have any heat. I set the temp to 80 degrees and it just blew cold air all night. I got a replacement room and the heater in that room also did not work I just gave up at that point.
30,Room was updated in the pyramid clean and quite. Only issue is that parking can be a pain with no indicators in the garage to show where vacant spots are located. Pillows are not the best and tv is not HD internet is fair but overall room was clean and fine as a base to move around the city.
10,Casino restrooms had sinks that were not working and had no water. Casino restrooms Soap dispensers and hand sanitizer dispensers throughout casino were not filled during the 2 night stay that I was there. Went to the front desk and asked for a manager and she did not seem to care one bit of my concerns she actually said she was the front desk manager and not casino so I asked her to pass along my concerns Mara Matthieu is the manager I talked to.
20,Our mistake of going to Vegas on Christmas since nothing was open. We decided to stay in our room and watch movies. No room service was available which is another unfortunate circumstance... But as we lay in bed our room was attempted to be open by a Luxor employee and when I approached I noticed she had her purse on! Never in a million years should an employee enter a guest room with a personal bag. That gives me the impression she was intending on entering our room and take my stuff.
20,Left a woman jacket at room which was a new presente for my sister in love with a $85 cost and claim it to lost and found and have a negative respond building all around look old and not operating especially elevator derty and old smell in rooms Parkin lot very long delayed to get out hard to find a parking space even when paid at check in
50,Spent 4 days at the Luxor - Room was very clean and staff very friendly Many things to do at hotel/casino and very easy to get anywhere on strip. Just not sure who designed (and approved) the shower - no door so floor gets soaked. Overall a great stay!
10,Stain on sheets rude customer service missed cleaning rooms. Long waits to call the front desk. If you have a family member who needs wheelchair assistance.  You can forget it! Not going to happen. Their in house cleaning lady who answers the phone is nasty and will talk to you any kind of sway and hang up on you.
20,No mini bar no refrigerator and no microwave. Buffet not near the quality to cost. Expected way more for the prices. Very limited tables running but this is city wide. I have stayed in multiple properties in Vegas but not satisfied with my most recent.
30,The buffet food and the quality of the food is below average. Compared to this it is very expensive. Every day is the same. There was no difference between the Christmas menu and the rest of the week menu. It was just a lot more expensive.
10,Used to like this hotel. This last stay was awful: dirty bed sheets clogged bath noisy AC digital check in did not work as expected. Hard to get information from  Staff long lines at check in. This was my last stay.
50,Great property and great staff  huge shout out to staff and members in Luxor that helped me and got me covered  I love the titanic exhibit and fantasy show too. It is a great Egyptian style hotel with every inch worth of exploring.
20,"Booked through Priceline in Sept and had a bad experince with The Luxor informing us that they could not put us up in a King suite for the price quoted and were offerred the Excalibur instead...hindsight being 20/20 we should have taken it. Upon calling the Luxor directly we were told by ""Steve"" that the king room we requested was available but at a higher price so we rebooked a King suite overlooking the strip...or so we were told. We ended up in room 16030 which overlooks the Mandalay Mall roof. The room had no amenities found in less expensive hotels and motels. Shower pours water all over the bathroom floor due to poor half glass wall design of the shower."
50,Great hotel awesome room. our trip was short we stayed in different hotels during our stay but Luxor's rooms Casino cleanliness were awesome will definitely visit again. Hope they reduce their parking charges at least for disabled peoples.
10,Was offered something that did not meet my expectations not happy would not go again due to it I had a room with all my amenities but offered a complimentary upgrade that was below standard calles room service no one answered not happy
10,We were told when we booked pools and hot tub would be open. This was incorrect. Box office staff member blew us off and told us there’s nothing really to be done with small children. She did not want to help us at all and we had to go to the concierge at mandalay bay to get any help.
30,I wasn't satisfied with my rooms for the first time I always stay in this hotel you guys need to provide the real details before everybody's stay it was my friends first time in Vegas very disappointed
10,shaky elevators very dingy looking you must pay for parking in the self park garage wether you are a guest or not...tables are not guest friendly you gotta have lots of money to play black jack. I had a better stay at the Tropicana for half the money Jesse R.
10,Very outdated. Not clean. Do not recommend. Can find cheaper price for better quality room. Wall was leaking by room. Smelled really bad. Almost slipped a few times. Not very safe. Some of bathroom tile had scotch tape holding in place…Wow! Never again.
20,Room was very clean. But it needs a refresh . Furniture and carpet needs replacing. First one bedroom suite in west tower so dark.  Moved to one bedroom suite in pyramid. Much nicer. But needs updating again.  Fridge working fine but empty.
50,Second time staying there is excellent great service a lot to do with out leaving the resort no matter the time always something to do we will stay there on our next visit and we’ll recommend to our friends and family.
40,Luxur hotel is a good package of Casinohotel and almost good location on strip makes it easy and enjoyable stay at this place.  there are some unnecessary charge like $15 parking/day and pool and spa for $40 which wasn't even open in cold December but overall it's ok Hotel for people want to be close to all amenities.
50,Loved the location for a Raiders Game. Staff was amazing! Very helpful at check in. Restaurant was very accommodating for changes to food order. The check out was very easy. The rooms were great for the price. We stayed in the tower but family was staying in the pyramid and their rooms were really nice.
50,This is the first time we stayed at Luxor and liked it very much. The tower room is quite spacious and very comfortable for a couple. The shower water pressure is very strong and the socking tub is quite big. The check-in was quick and you can do a self check out yourself without going to the front desk. Overall we had a very good experience there.
40,Pay $15 a day for a filthy garage that is full of homeless. Security nowhere to be found. Elevators were filty. Invest in some power washers. Want my $45 back. Must need revenue to have to charge for self park!
50,Went to Vegas for a raiders game the stadium was just a 10 minute walk from the hotel. Enjoyed our stay and would definitely come back. Everyone was friendly and accommodating. I recommend this hotel
40,The fans trashed what is a very nice place to stay. Staff were wonderful. If people get charged for smoking in rooms why don’t those who leave spaghetti all over a hallway on the floor or those who trash an elevator with food trash and spilled drinks get charged? Stay at Motel 6 folks.
50,This was a great place to stay. I have always stayed at the Luxor after the first time being there. I enjoyed the food the location price and overall quality. Dumb experience at the front desk is my first bad experience and that was not staff related but it did happen.
20,don't bother booking the aromatherapy suite for $10 extra they will attach a water bottle to the shower and call it luxury. wtf. no food was available and front desk was not local/didn't have any advice. a big fat roach plopped down from the ceiling as we walked to our room so that was cute.
10,We specifically booked a pyramid room (always wanted that experience) got through a massive check in line only to notice they gave us a non-premier tower room (not pyramid). Didn’t want to wait in the giant line again as we were very tired. Got to our room and heard a baby cry for the next 24 hours through the thinnest least sound-proofed walls I’ve ever heard at a hotel (and I’ve stayed in some pretty rough places)
10,Room was very old dark and carpet was dirty. Bathroom was small and dirty. The toilet bowl was disgusting there was drip of dried urine in the toilet bowl. TV was broken and we waited for an hour still no help. Until they upgraded us from pyramid to tower room. Still room was dirty esp the bayhroom there was even a hair clip and hair on the floor. Room wAs dark. Never coming back.
30,Luxor was the cheapest on the strip so for your money you get what you get. Rooms were basic and their buffet and dining was ok. The Casino is fine and alike to other places on the strip. Is located on the end of the strip so a lot of walking if you want to go down the strip. Overall it was ok and a decent stay for the price.
30,I slipped on the shower floor bruising my ankle. My wife mentioned she notice the shower flooring as slippery as she took a shower. She did not slip like I did. I never reported this we were pretty busy throughout our trip. The elevators were a mess. The weekend party goers left beer bottles and food on the floor of the elevator. Also it took forever to get an elevator.
30,Luxor has nice roomy hotel rooms in the East Tower. They don’t have a lot of hotel amenities. The bell desk is not open 24 hours which puts a lot of folks in an untenable position. It seems very easy to rectify and is something that is a guest comfort issue that needs to be addressed.
30,I have stayed in the Luxor previously and really enjoyed it. This time it was not as good. The room was pretty run down with holes in the tile in the bathroom AC knocking and rips in the ceiling. I did go down to make a few requests for items to be corrected and they did take care of these issues pretty quickly for which I am really appreciative. All the employees that I interacted with were so pleasant. There was a security person that was working near the check in desk that was really nice. I wish I could remember his name so I could give him a great review. This was not a fantastic stay but not bad overall.
20,The hotel rooms at Luxor was ok. It was clean and was a very good value. The TV was old but works. However it doesn't have a guide menu which was frustrating. The biggest issue I had was with the air conditioner. It had a temperature dial that didn't work at all. I turned it all the way to hot and it still pumped out freezing cold air. The room became sooo cold at night that my son got sick in the morning. Thankfully we only stayed 1 night.
10,i was transferred to 2 different rooms due to them being dirty and upraded to a suite and it was dirty also and i ended up catching covid19 virus due to rooms are definitely not sanitized considering I'm fully vaccinated and wear 2 mask and a face shield and gloves for protection
40,Convenient property with nice food options. Older rooms but affordable and offers lots of adjoining rooms for large families. There are also 3 Starbucks and a nice spa onsite. We enjoyed having the esports for kids and free tram connecting Mandalay Bay Luxor and Excalibur.
10,Bed was really uncomfortable. Bathroom shower had a little bit of mold. The couple next to us were having sex and we heard the whole thing. It was a horrible experience. Will not return to this hotel.
20,Overall it was ok. Room is not that great . Can be cleaned so much better. The parking garage elevators are like trash … no one cleans it seems.also bathroom showe caulking came off and all corners have black stuff so much
40,Decent room clean comfortable. Highly recommend downloading the app for check in. Was so smooth and can’t imagine the process without doing this. Biggest complaint was distance from parking garage and room and shower pressure was painful.
50,Checkin was easy peezy. Short stay but had fun. Easy in and out. Valet and bell desk was very helpful as well. Hotel stay was nice as well. Casino play was good as well. Access in and out of the hotel was easy.
20,Location was perfect for the Raider game but the noise at night and the constant smell of smoke made it difficult to sleep. There is no barrier between the rooms and casino area so all noise and smoke can be heard and smelt from you room.
10,Besides the location being next to Allegiant Stadium this resort isn't good. An hour wait to get checked in. The rooms were below average and fairly inconvenient to get to the casino and other areas. The shower pressure was a trickle the bathroom odly laid out and the view non-existent. The clea ning staff walked into our room without warning while myself and wife were getting ready I was in the shower and she wasn't fully clothed yet. I'd pass on this hotel.
30,The digital check in is really convenient and easy the parking is a mess and not free. The rooms are okay but check everything when you arrive because the floor of my bathroom was dirty. The location is perfect for Raiders game but not a lot of options to eat.
10,Make sure to keep everything with you and the day of check out you might as well stay I. Your room until checkout because if not they throw all your stuff away even at 9am it was 930 when they went into our room and threw stuff away and the only excuse was well we thought you check out and I was like my stuff was still in the room obviously we were not home and then for the worker to call us liars that was obsured
20,There was no shampoo or conditioner left in the room and no floor mat there was very low water pressure and a terrible smell coming from drains. Then 3 days after checkout got a surprise $52 charge to my card that I never authorized.
30,Mold in the shower room smells musty I wanted to stay in the pyramid but honestly I feel like I may have risked my health. The staff was nice the wait was really long to check in so I’d recommend downloading the app
50,Ive stayed at Luxor in LasVegas many times. I always have a good time there. It’s a very unique hotel. The pyramid rooms and the balcony experience is very cool. The tower rooms are nice as well. Good food fun bars Just a good time over all.
50,The rooms in tower 3 would not connect to the internet could not call out on our cell phones. Switched rooms to east tower much nicer room. the internet was slow but at least worked. The food in the buffet for Christmas was horrible. The salad was the only thing edible. Good location to go to Allegiant Stadium.
20,Dog poop all throughout casino floors and crying babies next to slot machines with their parents as well as small children sitting at slot machines pressing keys. Folks constantly removed their mask or cone in front paring lit with no mask.
10,Never again will we stay at the Luxor. I had to get my family out to another hotel nearby luckily I found one right away This was our first time staying at the Luxor towers and honestly I would not recommend a friend
40,I booked 2 rooms mostly based on PRICE at the Luxor over the Xmas holiday. I wasnt expecting much but was pleasantly surprised by the rooms! Clean up to date. Quiet. The elevators needed repair tho!
10,The elevators on pyramid rooms are dirty. Rooms are dates. There was a bug in room rhe first night. Got moved next day to a room next to the stairs and all the way on the other side if the elevators. Heard stomping from stairs all night. Beds are the worst. Very uncomfortable
50,Nice family vacation place to stay. It will be better if tge rooms are cleaner due to the allergy problem. But it a great place to stay and very reasonal price to stay.. Thanks and we will come back and stay there in the future...
10,I like the concept of luxor. The location is not the best but the concept is the best. The problem of the hotel is that it is too old. The room has an odd smell. I cannot fall asleep in this kind of hotel
50,Really nice room  better than expected the app to chek in is very helpful I didn't have to go in line to chek in front desk very helpful too bartenders very professionals and the room quality A+++++++
10,Sheets was dirty after they was changed the first night the water was off @4am when i trying to shower no warning or nothing. Parking was horrible for $15 each time u left. Rooms smelled of mildew as well
30,The hotel is good and ensure you get the upgraded rooms as the hotel is over 25 years old. They really need to do a better job providing a map and shows programs. The place is massive and you would be walking a lot if no guidance. Forget about calling from your room to front desk or bell desk- nobody picks up. A bottle of water is $8 - lol
40,Booked a semi last minute get away. Went back to the luxor as we have stayed before. Great value for the stay. No need to stay a little further down the strip and pay way more. Save that money for Hells Kitchen. Sooooo good there
50,Staff was friendly. The housekeeper was kind and respectful. Check in was fast and they provided great service answered all my questions. Everyone was overall so helpful. It was my first time there so I got lost often and the staff was there guided me around the hotel
10,The room had wetness all over the carpet it was yellow color soaked water looked like a pluming issue i notifed the desk but i guess no ine helped me i didnt stay my 2 nights had to leave due to that.
20,Checking in was not professional and was awkward and rude in front of my family. I won't recommend this hotel to friends and family! and would not reserve this hotel again... I never been so embarrass in my experience in Vegas before.
40,Finally stayed in the pyramid and it was fun with the slanted windows and the inclinator elevator. I am originally from NY so getting a Nathan's hotdog and fries from the food court right below my room reminded me of my childhood. The sports book was easy and casino not overcrowded cause of when we came.
20,Ok just wouldn’t stay here again was not satisfied one elevator was under construction looked terrible smell was terrible room smelled like cigarettes when I got a non smoking room staff were nice and friendly
10,Never thought i was going to walk in a dirty room ..there were hairs blood in tub the bed was dusty and full of hairs dust everywhere and no working tv.No sense of urgency to accommodate .If i dint keep on calling front desk i would of never spoken to a manager..took me 5 hrs to reach one. The first sup i spoke had no sense of urgency either. Never thought i would experience this at luxor
40,Bad shower design whole floor got wet during the shower and the toilets were clogged. Good stay but definitely not a “luxor”ios stay. Not worth the money I paid for the room. Casino is great everything else was great
50,It was great services and guest services helped my family a lot! I enjoyed my stay and will be staying more often. I would recommend this place to my friends and families. I have a good relationship with my guest services helper
50,Front desk receptionist when above and beyond for me and my family. My sister has a special needs daughter in a wheelchair and she made sure we were in the same floor to help my sister. She is an excellent person.
10,I was very disappointed with the condition of the room as I’ve mentioned in previous comment… bathroom shower was missing a shower door and water spilled everywhere on the floor… I slipped and banged my head on the wall
10,Terrible awful hotel. Check-in process was excruciatingly slow had to carry our bags for what felt like a mile to the rooms. Room looked like it has had a drinking problem for the last 30 years since the photo was taken. Stank of cigarettes and febreeze. We had no hot water from the shower or sink. On hold for 10 minutes to reach the front desk. The staff was at least nice enough to give us a better room. The whole place is janky and feels really outdated. Everyone looked depressed and the food was overpriced and mediocre. Also tons of people without masks nobody enforcing it. Cigarette smoke pervades every part of the hotel. Not really walkable to get to the part of the strip you might want to see as a tourist.
40,I was able to stay using some redeemable points. Staff was helpful with check-in. Showed me how to check in using cell phone. Only down side is parking. Valet charges $26 to park.. self is $15 for over night.. if you leave you repay.
50,Been staying here for years and they always deliver 5 star service and quality. Front desk was efficient and generous all staff along the way to rooms were helpful housekeeping was kind. Bell service was so helpful and patient. Valet was quick and accommodating.
20,I was there on a birthday trip soon as I walked in to get checked and the lady at the front desk just tells us no without giving us a second option me and my friend had it to come up with our own solution after an hour. They also show favoritism to the white people and insinuated that me and my friend couldn’t afford to stay at this hotel when we finally get in the room the shower is flooding. also I was laying down in the morning on my phone and a bug crawled on the pillow.
10,The room was dirty and needs to be upgraded. We rented a 2 room suite and the bathroom was filthy and the shower was small. The bed only had 2 pillows and the living area was dark and dingy. The TV did not work properly. Just not well maintained.
10,Everything is dirty we switched rooms twice.  First one had dog poop pills all over the bathroom floor and counters human hair balls everywhere. 2nd room reeked from cigarette smell. Didn’t even have to walk in as soon as door opened smell hit you in the face. Had to cancel my dinner reservation because I spent over 2 hours dealing with the room situation as we booked 3 rooms and all 3 were extremely dirty
20,Room was outdated and had no in room amenities such as coffee maker was a half mile walk from room just to get coffee. Room was dark and dreary and not extremely clean. The elevators kept getting stuck and took forever to get one .
10,Waited in line 30 minutes to check in because the app cant handle 2 room reservations and kept freezing. They tried to tell is our room was cancelled even though we had a confirmation number. He wanted to “see what the manager could do” until we insisted on our reservation. We feel they were trying to rip us off and sell us a more expensive room. After 15 mins of clicking around he got us our rooms not together as booked (and confirmed) of course. The room had no fridge safe or coffee making facility.
50,Our staff was wonderful.. The rooms were clean all staff respected CDC guidelines. The only thing we were missing was a microwave and a refrigerator in our room. The location was perfect. I would stay here again
40,It took us 45 minutes to not be able to find parking and valeted at the hotel next door. Took 1 hr in the registration line to get to our room and it was dirty. They changed our room. We came down to the tables to gamble in a very bad mood. Siu Lam is the pit boss tonight and she was amazing. Literally changed our frowns upside down. She was exceptionally nice. She is funny kind and such good company. She is solely the reason we stayed and gambled more here and will come back to see her again. We very much appreciate her for changing our night with simply her personality. Employees like her are so important. We are very grateful for her. Thank u Siu Lam. If it wasn’t for her and I could this place would have got negative reviews.
30,If I could the Luxor a 3.5 I would. I stayed there for 3 nights and had a good experience. The architecture of the hotel and sculptures inside are beautiful. It is close to Excalibur which has a bigger food court and access to the strip. The food court at the luxor was limited but ok everything was open except for the sub place. We didn't experience long lines or long waits and that was a plus. We ate at the food court and plubic house... food was good and no waits or reservations. I wanted to try diablos cantina but didnt have enough time. I wasnt impressed by the show line up so we didnt see any shows. Everyone we encountered was friendly and attentive. We enjoyed the machines and did have some winnings but we pretty much won back what we spent. The comp drinks were a little weak but it was fine whenever I wanted something stronger I just went to one of the nearby bars. Some small details about the hotel are dated but it was clean and room service came daily. We were about a 25 minute walk from the Bellagio fountains so that may help with location. The cocktail waitresses were attentive but it did take a while to get a drink but that could be due to being short staffed. There was no problem with noise and the dj at the centric bar was good(friday night). I probably would not stay here again but only bc there are so many different options in vegas but it a good place to stay for someone on a budget.
50,The overall trip was for business and for pleasure and all my needs were met every single all the time of the day everything was awesome and I definitely planned on returning to the locksmith many more times in the near future and Someday I hope to even live there in one of the corner Queen suites
50,It's a good place to stay but wish they had given us white towels. Especially what they charge a night you would think they could get rid of the brownish yellow towels (over used). Other than a white stain on the carpet and yellowish brown towels it was good.
50,Renovated rooms are awesome. Great job! Parking is a long walk but expected at a casino. Everything was clean and exciting. All the staff were friendly. On premise amenities are expensive but that’s expected.
10,This trip was infuriating at worst frustrating at best. It's totally a budget hotel i get that but so are Excalibur NYNY etc. Go to one of those instead. The elevators require a room key and if you download the app they tell you to download it'll work maybe 10% off the time leaving you stuck on a random floor. Even with functional room keys it only works half the time. There's nothing like carting all your stuff around desperately trying to get to the floor you need and having to constantly leave the elevator to try and get the key to work.  They are dog friendly but we literally couldn't enter one.of the elevators because one of the housekeepers just stood in the entryway staring at the dog resulting in yet another missed elevator.  The food options are terrible the buffet is straight up nasty. (We knew it would be but just went out of convenience for breakfast)  There are so many budget options in Vegas just don't even bother with this hotel. Let them demolish it and move on.
10,Human feces in the stairwell for days. Broken elevators. No staff anywhere. Unclear signage to emergency exits. The place is falling apart and unhygienic. Emergency phones in stairwells broken. Lackadaisical staff clearly have no support.
10,We've been coming to Las Vegas for 21 years and my wife surprised me with a trip for our 20th Anniversary only to sind a horrible room smell and a wet carpet when she kneeled down to call the from desk. Moved to a second room where the sink stopper was broken. They would not let me speak to a manager and just brushed aside the issues.
20,The room location was terrible. Dark boring. The bathroom was bad design  The resorts price makes it unattractive  The buffet price was $39.99 which is not economical for a 100 pound lady who doesn’t eat that much. The 12 years old girl who doesn’t eat much
30,I recommend this hotel for people on a tight budget. It’s just a place to lay down for less. If you want a luxury experience the Luxor is not it. The staff was amazing and the lobby is pretty but that’s where the buck stops.
50,From the moment of check-in even though my room was no longer available the experience was exceptional. I received a free upgrade which meant that I had a bath and shower in my room. The king bed was very comfortable so my sleep was nice. There is a 24 hr gym located near the spa. Also the shows that are appearing at the Luxor are quite spectacular. I personally wouldn’t mind coming back!
40,In all I had a great trip I dont have any complaints except the door on the shower was a nice stay pyramid cafe fries could have been nicer as well I also enjoyed the restaurant choices inside of the hotel
10,We got a cheap rate and I would’ve rather paid full price somewhere else. This hotel was nasty. Faucet was coming out of the wall. Toilet was messed up. Screaming drunks. (I am absolutely aware that people party in Vegas and that’s cool but this was 5am screaming/ yelling for over and hour until we left.) If it wasn’t for us getting on a flight in 14 hours we would’ve left. Just stay somewhere else!
50,Excellent stay - We had two rooms and front desk accommodated us by getting second room on same floor and stay well room.  Our rooms were very clean and no smell of smoke in the room- very important to us. The restaurant at the café had great breakfast and excellent service
30,Enjoyed the trip but the room wasn't clean. There was stuff all over the bathroom  Floor and the tile around the tub had black foot marks. The tub was dirty and there were no batteries in any of the remotes. Plus they shut the water off with no warning or notification.
40,We enjoyed staying at the Luxor. We stayed in the towers because that was all that was available with two queen beds when we booked. We would have liked to stay in the pyramid but maybe we can next time if I book earlier. My only complaint is that they charge $15 a night for parking plus a $35 per night resort fee. The resort fee should include parking and they shouldn't even be charging for parking since it's a casino.
50,Simply walking around the interior of the casino transports you to another world. Truly awesome experience. The bars are all friendly. The slots and tables are ran by friendly staff. The front desk workers will assist you with any troubles. Overall a truly amazing experience.
30,The atmosphere outside the room was not bad at all…but as far as the room it was not satisfactory there are no room amenities ie complementary coffee maker refrigerator or microwave  The only thing In the room is a bed and television and the channels sucked …but if I had to say anything nice about it…the water hot
50,We were very strategic when selecting where we wanted to say. We wanted to be comfortable and not directly into the nightlife. The Luxor is beyond perfect. Tower One Bedroom Suite with the best views! 10/10 recommend!
50,Awesome hotel theme  safe secure Place  Excellent invisible staff  Prosperous Front Desk  Very clean Property  Very simple navigation orientation  Minus for winter weather  Minus for furnace  Minus for dusty road morning cafeteria
50,It was a great stay. One of the cheaper resorts on the strip but the rooms were nice and had everything I needed. I mostly gambled worked out and walked the strip. The Luxor is connected to both Mandalay Bay and Excalibur so you could stay within all three to gamble honestly. The fitness center was really nice. Equipped with a full dumbbell rack Smith Machine and various cardio machines. Location wise it's on the south end of the Strip but really was not bad of a walk to get to the Bellagio. Maybe take a cab if you want to go past that side of the strip.
50,Experience of my life so far I had so much fun. And excellent food! Diablos Cantina had the best quesadilla I’ve ever had. The new pizzeria was very delicious I even ate the crust and I usually never eat the crust. Casino was awesome!
50,Incredible stay staff very nice and helpful and house keeping was great. Would recommend a stay and the amenities are incredible. Great location and very close to all attractions - a fun place with a lot going on.
20,If you do choose to stay here stay away from the buffet. It was the worst I’ve ever had. The rooms smelled moldy and we had to call for towels and amenities. There are plenty of nicer places to stay.
40,All i all another good time at the Luxor. Super easy check in they didn't have the room I requested but gave me a small upgrade to a tower room. Only wish it had a fridge and microwave though. It was pretty quiet midweek but the weekend seemed busy. I was a little disappointed that Tender was closed.The only real negative and it's not the fault of MGM or Luxor but there are a lot of homeless folks around and some in the casino. They did a good job keeping them from bothering people though.
10,The room was dirty hair in the bathroom on the floor‘s. Two towels that’s it. One bar of soap no soap for the bathroom sink. No shampoo nothing at all in the room. No coffee pot microwave nothing. You have to hunt for the elevator which was down a long hallway something could happen to you if you were alone. No service at all.
50,Starting with the front desk receptionist Josephine she is awesome. Right away she started a warm conversation and we end up talking like old friends. She really left me with a smile all the way to my room.  The room was very clean and I was told that it was newly renovated. It really felt spacious cozy and functional. The bed was comfortable the pillow were soft and the TV was a good size with plenty of channels and an HDMI port. The cleaning lady was so nice and very helpful. I don’t have any complaints and I’ll definitely book my next Vegas stay at Luxor
30,Stayed for my honeymoon. There were problems with my room and I was not told about pulling money out of my account. They should tell people that as they check in and not have to find out when they check out
50,Luxor never disappoints very clean friendly staff great restaurants. Our 5th time in Vegas and always stay at the Luxor. Diablos bar has the best Mexican food and Riras Irish pub is our go to breakfast spot . The eggs Benny is to die for !
40,Must stay hands down a great all around experience. A place to bring the family or your partner to get away from home for a bit. Make sure to Sign up for your MLife rewards account trust me you’ll think me later.
50,Hotel was excellent and in a good place on the strip. Buffet was good. Room was spacious and clean. Bathroom was big. Good price for the stay. There were less expensive places to eat on the upper floor. Hotel was connected to 2 other hotels so you didn't have to walk outside.
10,Customer service personnel was very rude. Hallway to room had some foul odor that was there for the duration of the trip. Too far to walk to room for a person with a handicap. Will never stay there again!!!
30,The rooms are old and shabby. The attempt to modernize the shower was ridiculous. Water was all over the outside floor by the toilet when I took a shower. It only had one glass panel to keep water inside the shower. I felt like I had a swimming pool in the toilet area.
40,Great place to stay and very friendly staff. Great room clean room lots of space to unpack your stuff and put away. But be nice if it had a refirg to put left over in. Lots of great places to eat and relax
30,The check in was a mess from the start a woman pulled us from the line to take us to check in faster but it was not fast at all she tools us to another part of the lobby then quickly stated unclear instructions and walked away other quest were there too and were confused lol she came back and said sorry we are short staffed and I had to translate then she quickly stated more instructions and left again we finally figured it out and then she came back and said oh good you use elevator 1b purple and pointed and left not telling us we had to use our key card to activate the elevator we found that out from another guest in the elevator we also did not know that the first 2 numbers of our room was our floor number again something the staff could have told us but we figured it out after a few minutes
10,Absolutely do not stay here! Horrible service was told at 3:30pm my room was still not ready and when it finally was ready their was stained blood on the sheets and no running water. Don’t stay here save yourself! It would have been better to stay at a motel 8.
40,Queen bedroom was fine. Bathroom was fine. Nice size. Furniture could do with a bit of updating but worked for me. Interior of the hotel was impressive lots of Egyptian artifacts. A good number of food outlets to choose from including buffet cafe and food court. Casino was good to me. CW service was passable.
10,The room smelled funny as soon as I walked in. The bathroom was disgusting door had brown smears all over it and the shower had limited warm water with no pressure. The bed killed my back and you can feel the springs. the TV was not hi def probably 20 years old and there was no mini frig or central air. I could go on but what's the point.
20,Stayed here due to my arriving early and my Airbnb wasn’t available until the following day. First and last time I will stay at this hotel. Didn’t have adequate supplies in my room. Customer service was rude no fridge in room and the list goes on
20,Parking fees resort fees. None of these were quoted in the initial reservation. The rooms are nice but lack amenities that other provide (microwave mini fridge coffee). I don't recommend staying in the Luxor.
40,Every thing was automated from check-in parking to the key to get into our room and even checking out - easy breezy on the MGM app...we highly recommend it!! Conveniently located to multiple restaurants and shopping not only in the Luxor but the nearby Casinos that were all inside && walking distance. Added bonus the venue for our concert was just a quick walk after we had a yummy bite to eat too!!    Spacious room comfy king-size bed quiet location in the East Tower with a soaking tub walk-in shower plenty of space in the bathroom to get ready and mirrors in the large room for us both to get ready for our night out! Not only did we enjoy our stay - we plan on staying here again for our next concert in Vegas! See you soon Luxor/MGM properties!!
30,Our premium room did not have a refrigerator a microwave or a coffee pot. Those items would have been very beneficial during our 4 day stay. The service was great and the staff were very friendly and welcoming. The room just wasn't great. Average....but not great.
10,Not only did our room have no running water for our stay but they only provide one pillow per guest. That seems a bit under the standard. When I called to get 4 extra pillows they told me that I could only have two. Won’t be staying here again.
30,We were travelling from California to Texas on a quick trip and decided last minute to stay at Luxor since I have stayed at this casino many times in the past the check in was slow standing in line for about 45 minutes clerk talked very fast and we had to ask her to repeat herself several times the rooms we had appeared dated not what I expected or what I experienced in the past I was disappointed to say the least
50,From check-in to check-out our stay at the Luxor was great! Great service great clean room great food. Couldn't have asked for a better vacation. It was easy to get drinks served while gambling too
10,Not satisfied with my stay room is dirty room service is slow won’t book there in the future. Front desk stuff wasn’t nice. We try to find ways to fix the problems but they just keep saying the rooms all booked. Anyway it’s my worst experience in Vegas.
50,I stayed in the room by myself it was suoer quiet and relaxing. The only issue I had was when I got my room it seemed as if it hadn't been cleaned after the last checkout.. But other than that it was an overall amazing experience
20,We got there and the room was cold the heater was broken and when i call the front desk for help they put an order for maintenance but took a long time and when i call back requesting change room the lady was rude and say all room have same temperature (very cold? I said) finally maintenance man come fix it he was very nice . Unfortunately my companion got sick because he got shower and room was so cold.
50,This was my first time in Vegas. Hotel was super cool lots of features inside with the casino and restaurant. I also really liked that it connected to the other hotels/casinos next door. A little further down from the strip so cabs are necessary but other than that it was great for the price. We stayed in the pyramid with a king bed. No complaints about the room. Elevator is a little slow and freaks some people out because of the angle it goes on but it was fine for me. Staff was really friendly and the rooms were clean.
50,The was by far the friendliest people I have encountered. Very professional and knowledgeable of the different events and shows at the property. You can tell that they take pride in their work and enjoy the jobs that they do.
30,First time staying here and first time to Vegas. I wasn’t very impressed with the Luxor compared to the other hotels. Nothing was wrong with our stay which is great after getting out and exploring other places I probably would have picked a different hotel. I would say the Luxor is more for a family or older group. We came as a group of 25-35 in age.
20,The room is full of damaged furniture and half working light fixtures. The staff is basically nonexistent and would rather send you to mobile check in than help you and give you directions to your room. The bed is hard and nonexistent water pressure or hot water
50,Flew in from Oklahoma for a wedding at a different venue but stayed at the Luxor. My wife and stayed in a suite in the West Tower.    The room was very clean and nice. As was the entire staff. They were very friendly and helpful with directions and suggestions on where to eat or how to get to different places.
10,The stay was horrible due to the room was bad  outdated  heater did not work properly. The shower door was missing and all water was coming  Out to the floor and that can possibly cause injuries. Would not recommend
10,Very outdated hotel that could use a major cleaning of some areas. The hallway ceilings looked like they had 30 years of cigarette smoke on them. My room didn't have a fridge and coffee machine.....that was a first for me. Even at being the cheapest hotel on the strip still  not a good value. Spend a little more for a much better experience.
30,Even with its age I still love the Luxor....there are many things that need to be fixed blown up removed...but in all it's a convenient comfortable place to stay....There are too many add on charges like like paying for parking $15 per night...resort fee $30 per night ? Resort ?? where ?? must be in a different building...
50,Everybody was happy room was clean nice people and good food at the buffet.  We had a great time one of our favorite places to stay in las Vegas  Love the weather in winter is not too cold or too hot .
20,The staff was rude the price was okay for what we needed. I would not want to stay here again. If youre looking for cheap rooms then this is for you. The food selection is okay nothing fancy. So it was okay.
50,I had a wonderful time at the Luxor to the point I’m going to come back in April and I wish there was smoking in the rooms but I understand why. Backstage Deli was a good place to eat at especially after 4 in the morning
20,First I never got the room cleaned and we stayed 3 nights the first night we were ok with not being cleaned but the other two we even asked the cleaning lady and she completely disregarded my request.  Rewards program lady super rude with huge attitude didn’t get her name but she was a heavy set Latina in her 30s
40,My overall stay was great…I was there for 5 days only free play I got was $50 when I checked in played everyday didn’t earn enough for anymore wish that was different I know that is M Life rewards but wanted to mentioned it
30,Not what I would expect from an iconic Vegas hotel. Elevators had exposed electrical panels and one sounded like it was going to plummet to the ground. No refrigerators in the room and no room service. Water pressure was weak but hot thankfully. I will probably not choose to stay here when I visit Vegas again
40,The management team is great. The only bad thing was that our a/c in the room would not switch off. It was 61 degrees in the room. As my family and I check out the manager was kind enough to fix the issue and refund us for the room because we called the whole visit to have someone to come and look at the temperature.
40,My family and i traveled together with our adult millennials children. The fellas stayed here The experience was good (service etc.) but even the premium rooms weren’t updated well. There wasn’t enough closet space in room and the furniture was outdated
50,My stay was very affordable. The price was right. The Luxor was decorated beautifully for Christmas! It was Christmas in Egypt. My room was very clean. My bathroom was very luxurious. It’s always nice to have a large shower and separate bath tub.
20,Could have been better basic stuff not in suite. Like towel rack closet for luggage. No Room service no spa open. Place smelled like sewage no concierge. The bell desk is available but it's a far travel from the from drop off so u have to find a phone to call for one to come. If they know they don't have the staff atleast leave luggage carts available for us to bring our own items to room 🤷🏾‍♀️
10,Service is rushed at the house keeping portion of your morning hours and staff feels entitled to certain tip compensation. Be aware that they will most likely leave trash everywhere that mostly staff congregates at.
20,I don’t get for all the money I paid y I could not get a simple room cleaning y I can go out all day come back to a clean room smh nope I was calling at like 7pm or peak my head out the door am just to get some one
40,Overall nice stay the resort is awesome and close to the main strip. Love the architecture staff is very professional and caring. The room temperature was a bit low and did not warm up but overall clean and water did go cold a little on one of the days.
10,Front desk staff uneducated and unresponsive 2 proof of showing Bing double charge and they did nothing about it. Demanded I pay again after pre paying then paying again and giving the 150 for incidentals
50,Great hotel. Staff was friendly overall great experience for my first time in Vegas. Will definitely be back to the Luxor. Just need to wake my way up the ladder to become a platinum member so I can get the perks lol.
20,Luxor was once our go-to hotel in Las Vegas but the sheen has worn off. Aside from the iconic pyramid shape the Egyptian theme has been diluted to non-existence. The hotel was dirty the service poor and our room the product of too many slip-shod makeovers. Sad.
10,Bought a vacation deal thru hotels dot ca. Went to our room in the pyramid and OMFG. Old stinky 70's room with a lovely view of the airport. No.  So they changed us to a room in the tower which had been remodeled and was much nicer smelled good had style with a lovely view of The Airport.  Every airplane would wake u up. Thin walls all around.  Gym - great!  The Spa section was closed during the week but opened weekends. Went to look Friday and see that its basically a hot tub steam room and sauna. They charge 30.00 to use per day. No.  U will be lost AF in the Luxor at all times. Lost Vegas.  They should put tons of signs up like The Mandalay Bay. (not lost).  Extra info - If u want to actually WIN at the slots taxi to Circus Circus and look for the group of Coin machines. They r the old fashioned ones. I had to wait to get on one but I won a jackpot. :) The cashier said ppl get on one of those machines and never get off because they make ppl win. Yes they do!!!  Despite staying at The Luxor we had a Blast. :)
10,Were woken up at 1:00am and asked to pack up to get relocated because our shower had a leak. We packed up and waited for hours and never got relocated. Left at 10:30am with no sleep and without being able to shower.
30,It was alright. Check in process was not what I was told but the rooms weren't dirty at least and it was a cheap taxi away from anywhere you actually want to go. Casino and sportsbook are very nice so overall 3.5/5
20,I don't know which was worse -- the room or the parking. Second thought the parking was worse (and since we are Pearl members it was free). You walk a LONG way from the cheesy parking area through a wind tunnel where people are smoking pot. How pleasant.
50,Great service and helpfull staff members  No problem checking in or out  Super clean atmosphere 100% will be recomending it to friends and family  It was also my first time staying there and for sure it wont be my last
40,The hotel was nice the parking was fairly easy and the staff was helpful. We saw the fantasy show and it was great! Everything was easily accessible and the food was good! It was easy to walk over to Mandalay Bay for a few more shops!
40,You cannot be the price and the experience the rooms are great and big the restaurants have good food and a good price the theater is a great venue. it is very busy and the check in and check out process is way too long you really need to do it on line to save time.
50,Luxor rooms are very quiet and isolated from the insanity of Vegas itself. This hotel was part of one of the cheapest Expedia vacation packages yet the rooms seem very updated and immaculately clean. We will always use it doe our stay on future trips.
40,Do download the app and check in ahead of time inspect your room before bringing up your bags. We rented a car and used the mgm app for parking it was super easy. All the food places were really clean
10,"Rooms are outdated and dirty paper-thin walls (you can hear EVERYTHING that is going on in the rooms around you) they charge an extra fee for a mini fridge that is not included in high resort fee (even though the pool is closed so what is the fee for? Crappy internet that is free to all who visit the casino???) Hotel is on the end of the strip so you have to walk quite a ways to get to the good nightlife. Go somewhere else. This place should be called ""loss"" Vegas."
30,Room was ok but no bath tub. Shower sucked. Water leaked all over. Housekeeping only provides 2 extra pillows. I stayed al better places. Plus Luxor is hunted. I’ve stayed before and it was better then this pass time. Never will stay here again.
20,Property is pretty run down and dirty. Elevators sound like they’re going to break mid trip (shaking and rattling sounds). Nothing special about the guest rooms. Beds and furniture showing wear and tear. Property is past its prime and needs to be demolished.
50,Clean and ready when we arrived early! Close to the middle of the action. Great show! Good food. Everything you could need under one roof. Slots paid and would definitely stay again! Can’t wait for the next vacation!
10,The hotel was VERY dirty carpet was dirty. The room was not sanitized stains were on chairs shower and bath tub had hair so we did not use them carpet was not vacuumed tiled floor was not washed. I would NOT recommend this hotel to anyone!!!
10,"Worst hotel ever stayed in. Anytime we asked questions at desk - 3 people 3 different answers.    Run down - panels in elevator separating from wall. Grungy.    No mini fridge in room (or microwave). After eating out at Ramsey Steak and Bobby Flays ""Amalfi"" and taking home leftovers each night - hoping to maybe finish later in the evening - and couldn't (had to throw away some awesome food because no refrigeration).    $14-$17 sandwiches in hotel store - if you cannot finish anything you purchased - in the garbage it goes.    No mini coffee maker for a quick cup before venturing out. Had to go down 23 levels and walk to a Starbucks (in a brain fog) for a $4-$8 cup of coffee every morning. $4 for a water.    Too far to walk (for me anyway) into some kind of civilization. $11 cab ride to even find a CVS or convenience store for any necessities that they did not offer.    I looked up whether hotels in Vegas do offer mini fridge and/or microwaves (before posting this) and found a lot of them that at least have mini fridge (some include microwaves even small kitchens).    I know it was my fault for not looking for this amenity - but I have never stayed at any hotel in my life anywhere that did not have fridge/microwave/mini coffee maker so it did not even cross my mind to check.    BORING hotel in general - no life in it. (Ceasar's Bellagio Paris etc.) that we took cab too was exciting and fun.    I know the room prices were low (the hotel ""fees"" added on were more than the stay - so price doubled which is probably like that eveywhere. But not worth the depressing atmosphere.    Area is dead as a doornail. Spend a little more and stay in the middle of EVERYTHING - it will all equal out in the end.    I know this hotel was slated to be torn down back some time ago - I think it is time."
40,Overall I give it a 5 - wasn’t impressed with the service or the upkeep of the room. Needs upgrades and better staff  This was an okay stay but could’ve been much better If our room was more suitable for us
20,"First of all it was very hard checking in. They have you parking in self park before you can check in to your room. The self parking is in the back along with Mandalay Bay you wouldn't know it because there are no signs. After you park you have to lug your luggage across a bridge across the casino floor to the hotel which is a good block away. You wait in a long line and just before you get to the desk a woman comes to ""help"" and shows you to the self check in spot this is where you check yourself in make your own room keys etc. Thank goodness my sister was with us to figure all that out. We leave the front desk and go to find our room only to find out we have no idea which elevator to use. After walking for 20 minutes and trying 3 elevators we found a bell hop to help us. Finally up in the room both beds had dirty sheets on them the safe didn't work the shower didn't drain because there was a big clump of hair in the drain. The drawers were dirty. We paid extra to get a $30 food voucher each day and didn't know how to use that. We didn't know how to use the parking either because no one showed us. The only place open that we could use our $30 that day was the deli at Luxar. I ordered a cheeseburger combo and didn't get the cheeseburger! I told the man I wanted one and he argued with me and said I didn't order one but.he got my side dish that came with it right! I had to wait and pay again to get my cheeseburger which was $14 and not that good plus $8 to get my sides....big rip off!  We went there to see Americas got Talent live show so that's why we stayed there. Show was great...highly recommend but I'll never stay at the Luxor again!"
30,Stayed during NFR week. Only one bar open daytime on the casino floor and it was the small one. Elevators barely function with digital keys. Staff even tell you to get a hard copy and avoid digital. 4 days out of 7 no hot water at 9am. Food choices are awful and close early. Only late night food is sandwiches. Everything is so far away from this hotel. Spent hundreds on Uber’s Positives: Carrot Top is the best comedian on the strip and the shower pressure was the best we have ever had.
30,The Luxor is always a great property. A bit dated but you can't beat the location and gaming. If they would start the buffet this would make the hotel the one to beat for amenities and value... This is my 6th time at the property and I will come back.
30,Was a good to average stay but seems that MGM only puts money into the hotels and casinos that they want too. Look what they did to Park MGM. The Luxor and Excalibur are in desperate need to upgrading. The rooms have been done recently but the carpets and paint need to be done. Nice but sad looking
50,Very unique resort. We loved the view from our pyramid room. The staff was friendly and helpful. There is access to Mandalay Bay and Excalibur from the casino floor and easy walking distance to other shopping and casinos.
10,This was a nightmare had the worst neighbors and security/ staff did not handle the situation - rewards staff extremely rude and unprofessional- won’t stay again ever- try other hotels/resorts before u stay here
30,The hotel was cheap but I rather pay more to stay at a nicer hotel. They didn’t have the room we book and the room they put me in was not clean and shower took almost 10 minutes before hot water came on. Room did not have a fridge and over was not a good experience.
30,Hotel stay was very average. Enforcement of mask mandate very poor. More interested in profits than health of their guests. Needs to be reported to the Governors office and the casino control commission in Nevada.
30,Upon check-in it was incredibly easy to use the mobile check in app in fact it was so easy I checked in while still in my home state and when I landed I had a room immediately. There is entirely too confusing directions when coming into the hotel from the Rideshare entrance and actually made us stumble upon the correct elevator bank as find it. The casino looks well polished in most of the expected areas the lobby parts of the casino but if you look a bit off of the main path the hotel is howling it’s age. Rooms were par/below average. Blinds didn’t close all the way furniture looked very old and even in a non-smoking room you could still smell it in the carpet and walls. The bathroom was an experience as parts of the chrome and copper was starting to tarnish and the shower oh man the shower. Is the most poorly designed one that I have ever seen. The glass that covers the shower barley covers your body so no matter what you will be stepping all over the shower overspray and most of the time with 2 people needed an extra body towel to mop it all up. The bed was comfortable for a hotel bed and the pillows were quite plump. As for the cleaning staff… we’ll they left a lot to be desired. When we got into the room we still had some trash from a previous guest trash stayed in the hallway/elevator corridor for 3 days before it was picked up. One of the days the housekeeping services just never showed up to clean our trash or give us new towels. It resorted for us having to call down at 1:00AM to wait for fresh towels to be brought up since only 2 of the 4 elevators that services our floors were working. Everybody that works there is quite nice and tried to help in any way that they could but you could tell that they were just trying to make up for the subpar performance of some of their co-workers. If I was asked to stay here again… eh not really my first choice as the price was a bit higher then the service what I actually received. I would say overall save your money and go elsewhere until the Luxor invests in customer service training and a facelift.
50,Had so much fun here. Didn’t go to the strip much at all. My room was facing the strip and it was so quiet! The elevator was awesome and at night at like 3 am when no one was around it was still so fun
10,This may be a decent hotel I don't know because I have never actually stayed there. I did make a reservation months ago and am quite certain I cancelled it. So I was surprised to see a charge show up on my credit card. I called and was told they did not have it documented that I cancelled. When I started to ask the mlife representative some questions she hung up on me. My point is that if you do cancel a reservation with them make sure there is some kind of documentation. You will not receive any emails about your upcoming trip to alert you nor anything about check in or upgrades. So just be cautious. I wish I had double checked it.
50,We visited to celebrate sister in laws 50th birthday. Booked several rooms and they were able to make sure we were all next to each other. The rooms were clean and spacious every staff member was great! Dinner at Tender had great service and the food was amazing.
10,They overbooked the hotel and did not have any of the rooms available THAT WE BOOKED 6 MONTHS PRIOR to the trip. Then they did not adequately replace the rooms we all ended up in smaller rooms. We had a wedding party all coordinated to stay at the Luxor some 10 rooms. No one ended up in the room they origionally booked. Additionally the matriarch of the family got locked in the elevator for more than 3 hours and was not rescued until 1:30 in the morning.  Terrible experience.
40,For a first time in Vegas this was a pretty good trip. I wish the staf knew that flour tortillas were wheat and that I wanted corn.  Who builds a hotel room with no towel racks? The shower was also set up to go all over the bathroom floor. No door or curtain to keep it in.
20,The bathroom of our hotel was not clean enough. The floor showed signs of other guests. With the presence of covid I would expect everything to be spotless. The Pyramid Cafe was awful. The bacon was shreds and the scrambled eggs were like out of the box. Not fresh. Overall I would not recommend the Luxor. I was surprised because I had heard this was a luxory establishment.
20,The value is there if going through rewards program (m life) but the building and certain aspects of the rooms need a lot of improvement. Complete lack of outside light horrible TV setup with no selection and a poor bathroom.
10,Awful room right next to a room that was being remodeled. Every morning at 8AM woke up to pounding and drilling coming through the walls. Bathroom floods every time you take a shower. Housekeeping knocked every single morning even when I called and asked to be taken off the list. One morning a housekeeper just came in without even knocking. Upon check out the manager was extremely unfriendly and seemed annoyed that she had to listen to our concerns. Extremely poor experience. Would not recommend to any one and I will not be staying here ever again. Why put a guest right next to a room that is being remodeled?
30,I believe that your staff needs to be trained and beaten courteous to customers who are paying and willing to spend their hard earned money to stay at your hotel the hotel was extremely nice and wonderful
40,Great stay for one night shower was a little wonky seemed like it was missing a door but I suppose it’s the design. Clean rooms easy contactless check in/out. Easy access to taxis/ride share. Close to T-Mobile arena(our concert destination)
20,I stayed in the west tower and the room was nice. After my long drive the first thing I wanted to do is get clean and take a shower. I grabbed one of the folded towels and noticed hairs that were not mine on my body...
50,This is our first time staying in the Luxor towers. Several members of our party stayed here over the weekend. The rooms are clean inviting and up-to-date. The large bathtubs were a plus. Check in service was able to quickly move through the long line. Everyone we encountered was friendly. We would stay here again
50,I would like to thank all employees for ey u have done for me an my Husband we had a good time for Wednesday December 8-12 we just love the food and everything else was surrounded us as wellwe will be back very soon
20,The stay was complicated and several issues occurred. One the 1st room we were given had a dead rodent outside the window and the television did not function. Two the second room we were given was on a floor (8th) which smelled of foul sewage throughout the hallways. Three I was told the resort fees would be removed from the invoice and yet there were charges against my card.  I am very disappointed in the stay over all. I do appreciate the staff attempting to do the right thing. It is unfortunate my wife and I will not stay with an MGM owned property again as well as let our friends and family know about the issues we encountered.
20,No microwave or fridge. The hallways to the hotels are dingy. The elevator is really scary. Feels like it’s going to break down. Room windows are dingy. Was on the 30th floor and couldn’t see the view because the window was so filthy. If didn’t get this room at a discounted rate I would of been upset.
30,Needs some TLC with some room amenities and casino areas better csr at the my vegas desk long lines and while gambling waited for drink waiter forever she finally came but took forever to return with drinks then she brought the wrong drink etc
20,The price is cheap but so is the hotel very thin walls heater doesn’t work elevators were broken hallways and elevators were completely dirty for all 4 days. House keeping doesn’t announce just knocks the. Immediately opens the door. Early checkin doesn’t matter even if you pay for it room wasn’t ready until 3:25 when it was supposed to be at 11
20,It was a bad experience for our first time staying at that hotel . We checked in through app as it was said it will be easier . We walked in to our room was very messy smelled really bad as if no one had cleaned it ! Room was a mess dirty towels everywhere it was not okay . We tried calling room service and the front desk and there was no answer we had to go down once again from the 30th floor .
20,This was not a good experience. We were told when booking the room it would accommodate 3 but it only slept 2. No coffee in the room but there was a coffee maker. And the TV and Wifi never worked properly. Service was also very slow to the room. We were not happy.
20,Unfortunately our recent stay at the Luxor was disappointing. There were numerous examples of deferred maintenance throughout the hotel. Staff was pleasant and helpful. Facility was poor. Taking into account the age of the property about 30 years old and not necessarily a 'luxury' MGM property these should not be excuses for the tired looking and poor facility conditions we observed. Would not recommend this property.
30,I paid for a premium room but it didn't feel premium... There were obvious stains even on the tile floor in the bathroom. Dust bunnies and had a pungent weed smell as soon as we walked in. If all you're looking for is a place to sleep don't bother booking a premium room. Stick with the lower priced rooms.
40,Room was clean & comfortable. The only thing negative was the water pressure was low & the shower didn't drain well. We like that the rooms are typically quiet. Overall we have always had great stays at Luxor. Will definitely come back!
30,Luxor I am extremely disappointed this go round I came to this hotel around 2015 and it was great. The facilities were well manicured there were things to do in and around the hotel. Fast forward to now it seems a little run down. The tv and remote were not in working order  when I called to report it no one ever came. There was paint lifting in the bathroom. It appears that the hotels attractions are no longer up and running. So every time I stepped out of my room I saw the garbage and miscellaneous items that were no longer in use. The elevators were not working so I had to take my baby and stroller down the steps. I felt so bad for one lady who was wheelchair bound and literally had no way to get downstairs. It appeared that only 2 of the hotels elevators were in working condition so I could take the steps or wait 20-30 minutes for the elevator. It just seems to be forgotten about like no money invested to keep it current and in working condition. Luxor what happened ?
30,When you go to Las Vegas you have a lot of choices of places to stay! Some places seem to want your business and will give you small perks to encourage you to stay at their property! Not so with Luxor! They give you a free room and food credit to get you there to gamble but won’t accommodate something as simple as requesting rooms be near each other on a family 21st birthday celebration!
10,The room was not the cleanest the description of the room was totally different then what we got. There was no microwave fridge hair dryer shampoo soap not enough towels. For what we paid it was not worth.
10,DO NOT RECOMEND THIS PROPERTY FOR A STAY - We reserved a 2 bdrm penthouse - rm was a disgrace 4 TV's 2 broken. Running toilet all night. Pool cues broken. Garbage left in cans. Mandatory mask wearing policy was not enforced in casino.
30,The hotel was good. however i was not told there would be no hot water in the pyramid part of the hotel for an extended period of time. i was told it was scheduled maintenance but i stay up late and ha not showered all day. I was moved to another room in the towers and that was great service but it was an inconvenience.
10,This was a horrible hotel for the price you pay. The rooms smelled like a combination of pot and smoke. Rough towels no service to room no heat. Not good! Stay at your own risk. A Super 8 motel would have been better.
50,Me and my new wife. (We were married in Vegas) loved the Luxor. The buffet was great. The casino was clean and the drink attendants were veins and kept us very happy.    The newly renovated room was also clean and very nice. We both slept like babies on the very comfortable mattress.    The architecture was great to walk through daily. So many details in this historic resort.    Our one and only negative which is not the hotels fault at all was the distance to the central part of the strip.    We enjoyed our stay. We would definitely stay again and look forward to our next visit.    Thank you for a memorable wedding and honeymoon trip. It was special.
20,The room (king in the pyramid) was just okay. Comfortable bed and chairs but the AC was kind of difficult. Elevators were slow and dicult - worst part of the stay. Restaurants were mediocre even the food court meals were $15+ for a burger but that might just be Vegas pricing and the food was just okay nothing exceptional. Same story at Diablo's (mexican) and Pyramid Cafe (might have the name wrong american brunch food) The whole main area just felt kind of run down though with dull carpets paint and trim just seemed dull the plates behind the elevator buttons were so dirty - that kind of thing.
50,Fun decor friendly helpful staff throughout the venue. The food at Public house was pricey and bland the Pyramid Cafe was great! Servers were fast with drinks on the cAsino floor. It did ruin an entire morning plan that the spa was closed and no one bothered to mention it. Over all the place was clean comfortable and I would stay there again.
50,We went for our wedding anniversary and spent 4 nights in Vegas based out of Luxor. We had a great time. The suite was spacious and clean the staff was friendly and accommodating and we came out winners!
30,Parking fee  Resort fee but pool closed  No cocktail waitresses on the gaming floor  Dirty  No mask enforcement. Felt unsafe  Homeless people hanging out on the gaming floor. Asking for money and cigarettes. Just not worth spending my money there.
20,Rooms wasn't cleaned well check in was a nightmare the chapel and the rice restaurant was closed we came our first time ever out of Hawaii we chose Vegas to get married and wanted to have the Luxor chapel and the rice restaurant to be the places to celebrate unfortunately they were both closed first room was not cleaned well at all lint and rubbish all over the floor hair in the tub so we had to go back down with all our stuff then changed to another room that wasn't that much cleaner but better then the first but this time had to back down again because the room keys didn’t work it was just a nightmare to check in
30,Elevator was being serviced and still being used by 6-8 people at a time. I’m talking construction tape exposed floors everything! Did not like that. Hotel was decent. Room was nice minus hearing my neighbors showering and flushing the toilet late at night. They are a very clean hotel and the housekeeping team was awesome. Casino and staff were great. Front desk was also very nice. No big complaints about the Luxor but I probably won’t be staying here next time I visit Vegas.
10,The ceilings in the hallways were filthy. Popcorn blown ceiling had not been cleaned in years and the dirt and filth was amazing how could you not be embarrassed by this? Staff never greeted or said hello as you passed them in the hallways. Check in folks seemed to consider your presence as an irritation rather than happy to serve you. Just overall very disappointed. This was to be a special time and really the hotel experience (the largest cost of our trip) was just awful.
20,The outside looks amazing but inside there is just the smell of tobacco smoke a long check-in line and sub-par rooms. The shower didn’t drain the walk from the elevator to the room was really long from any direction and the cleaning staff was pushy.
20,Staff was kind and helpful. Tower room was rundown and the bed was very hard. But room and hotel was clean. The sports bar food was very good. Location was convenient and easy to get Ubers. Probably would not stay again because the bed was so hard and so I never got a good night's rest.
20,The hotel asked me to leave a review…. I don’t know why because it was a bad experience. Waited 30+ minutes on hold trying to get ahold of the front desk. There was no remote in your room which took hours to get. The room keys stopped working 3 times during our stay. Parking was never added though we asked on several occasions to add parking…. Our cards never worked! We won’t return. The upgraded room was not worth the upgrade at all
30,We have enjoyed the Luxor in the past. This time it was pricey for the value we received. First we were placed on the ground floor with a view of the pool chairs that were stored behind a wall at the pool. On the plus side it was relatively quiet since the pool was closed. For the price we paid we deserved a better room. It was convenient to the Casino. Along with a very rude hostess at the Public House definitely left a bad taste in our mouths...we may look elsewhere next time we venture to Vegas.
50,We have been staying at the Luxor for over 25 years and its like visiting family every year. We have made friends with many of the staff and look forward to seeing them each year. Grumpy staff is the exception not the rule at the Luxor service is outstanding from the drive onwards.
40,Luxor is a great place to stay… convenient location… decent price… great views and nice rooms… casino floor great for gambling and the variety of restaurants makes it hard choice to decide where to eat but nevertheless the place was great
50,Me and my bestie were there celebrating our birthdays we needed a little help getting to our rooms and getting around before we could get our scooters the next day. Security was very kind and very patient to move us around in our wheelchair so that we can go eat and some things before we went up to our room. The next morning they came down with us down to get our scooters. They did it with a smile on her face and no complaints and for that I am grateful.
30,When we got to the hotel the bathroom was dirty and needed to be cleaned by housekeeping. The staff also told us that even through we had electronic check in that we had to go to the front desk or we will lose our reservation and we would have to book another room for $75/nt. This turned out to be not true and would not make any sense because that is the point of online checkin.
30,Digital checkin and check out from the app made things very easy. The hotel room was clean the common areas could have used some work. The rooms did not coffee makers which meant every morning I had to go down 20 stories and purchase coffee from starbucks...I'm not a fan of starbucks. However the room rate was very fair even with the $35 per night resort fee tacked on.
10,I’ve gone to Vegas lots of times and this is the first time I’ve had anything bad happen to me. I left my white gold diamond ring inside my bag on top of my bed because the safe in the room was already locked. I left for the afternoon and when I returned to my room the room had been serviced and my bag was on the floor almost hidden in between the bed and the lamp. Besides that nothing looked out of place or suspicious. When I looked for my ring it was gone. I filed a report with the hotel but now when I call for updates all I get is that they can’t do anything and to file a claim with the Las Vegas Metropolitan police. How can the hotel not be able to do anything about this. Only their staff has access to the rooms. I need answers.
20,Outdated property room lacked refrigerator or working heat carpet outside room was soaking wet for multiple days elevators dirty with one of them inoperable over multiple days. Staff is fine but hotel needs to be renovated and made modern to compete with other Strip properties.
20,Checkin even with highest level of Hyatt and Mlife was long. Room was dated no bottle water coffee pot or mini fridge. Towels were minimal for 2 guest undersize and looked used. No USB ports and drapes would not close. Self parking there is not enough room to tell you how that went. Staff seemed to understand for a weekend.
50,My parents and I always come in the winter. In general I love MGM properties but I love the Egyptian theme and the proximity to the Esports arena. The beds are comfortable and the staff are super nice
20,Room heater did not work noisy room from music all night. No coffeemicrowave or refrigerator in the room. Most people ignored the requirement to wear a mask. Maze like pasages to find the elevator. Shower design allowed water to get all over the bathroom floor.
40,We came to Vegas for the NFR and decided to make it an adventure out of it and ended up getting married while we were there. We didn’t have any issues with our room other than the shower didn’t drain very well. The elevator situation (though we understand why it  Is done this way) was a little aggravating as we had family on a different floor and if we needed to get to them we had to meet in the lobby to get to them. Overall it was a great stay
20,Disappointed felt misled had high hopes but those quickly faded staff seem listless not engaged low energy detached; my room was sub-par standard with absolutely NO amenities; the cleanliness of the room was questionable at best.
10,"Front desk staff member was argumentative when I asked and lightly disputed a deposit. Room was warm and musty and there was a lack of amenities. Issues were not resolved and based on front desk response to my wife ""Well if you want a coffee maker then you need to upgrade to a suite."" That tells enough. All they care about is their money and taking it from us with very little to offer. My Cousin and his wife stayed at a hotel in the bad neighborhood in Vegas during this same time frame for his 50th and he got better service than my wife and I at a luxory resort. There are a lot better hotels out there stay at them don't give your money to this supposed Luxory Resort Hotel and Casino!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
50,Overall great hotel. We got to check in early & it was easy & painless. This was our first trip to Vegas & the Luxor has great proximity to the strip & other hotspots in Vegas!! Definitely recommend the luxor
50,This trip was the first trip to Vegas for my fiancé and I. We had such ease in the Luxor with check in shops attractions and more. It is a simple walk to ANY hotel on the strip. It’s very nice that they all are connected in some way and you are able to walk the whole strip and have enough to do to pace yourself. I will definitely return and recommend the Luxor to anyone and everyone!
50,I enjoyed my stay  i had such a great time downstairs at the casino . I enjoyed walking to the strip down the street . Me & my boyfriends first time in Vegas & Luxor hotel made me feel so comfortable I loved everything about the hotel
40,I gave Luxor another try because the rooms where so cheap.    They seemed better staffed this time around. Room is still clean and everyone is friendly. Lines where not as bad for food but that is probably because they opened more things up.    Buffet is average at best. No crab legs still. It is overpriced but every buffet in Vegas is overpriced.    Easy walk to T-Mobile which is a huge plus.    I still recommend this place if you want to stay cheaply on the south end of the strip. But if you want something nice with upgraded amenities look at MGM Mandalay or go further north on the strip.
20,The hotel itself is fine but the rooms are a joke for the price. We paid a large sum of money for a “premium” tower king room and to say disappointed would be an understatement. These rooms don’t come with any amenities (mini fridge microwave or coffee pot) . Our view was all of the HVAC units on the roof. Food and beverage deals offered on website were not honoured at checkout like we were originally told. Hotel staff were extremely friendly and rooms were cleaned daily so that’s a plus
10,Stay was pretty terrible. Immediately regretted stay. Walked into room with dirty blankets on floor and none on bed. Room was smelly. The heater/ac unit didn’t work. Shower would overflow on every use. When contacted house keeping they were rude. When contacted the second time about another issue they never showed up. Hotel is outdated. The rooms are literally falling apart. The buffet food was terrible. Definitely not what I expected. So worth paying an extra hundred dollars to stay in another hotel.
50,I stay at the luxor Atleast once a year. I love the casino and the rooms provided.  There are many great choices to eat as well as entertainment. I feel that the hotel needs some technological updates but it is perfect for my purposes
10,Was just at the Luxor for a long weekend. I realize that people are tired due to the pandemic but customer service was terrible. Upon check in we had lots of problems with key cards which means you're stuck in the elevator and the front staff didn't apologize for it not working... just gave new cards. Had a problem ordering a gift and flowers to be delivered to newlyweds. On my 1st call to the front staff they said they don't do that at all since the pandemic. So I asked if concierge would know of places outside of the hotel... when they transferred me to concierge concierge said in fact they DO provide that service and ordered flowers and chocolates. But then they were never delivered and concierge said they were... the computer says so. I said do you think my friend is lying about flowers not arriving? It took many calls before they found where they had been taken (wrong room duh) and when they delivered them to the newlyweds the chocolates had bites taken out of them!!! I got no apology and spent more then an hour trying to solve the issue.
30,Old hotel they don't even have a fridge or coffee maker. The walls are super thin we heard the guy next door snoring and his TV blasting. As soon as you step off the elevator it reeked of weed. Worse part the lumpy beds.
40,Enjoyed my time at the Luxor before traveling home to Ohio quick trip but had a good meal and a quiet night of slots. Rooms need to be upgraded with new TV's I know you're not in Vegas to watch TV but would be nice to have a bigger screen for later in the night. Easy check in and check out also easy to get a taxi over to the airport.
10,The Luxor may have once been a destination hotel but no longer. Old in terrible need of a complete renovation even the food court feels aged out. Poor layout though perhaps that is attributable to its small overall size generally. Oh and what few staff are attempting to adhere to COVID-19 health and safety protocols few are requesting guests to do the same - though when they do try they come off as rude pompous asses. Only saving grace - its near Allegiant Stadium if you happen to be in town for a game.
40,Rooms were exceptionally clean bed comfortable and nice. All the amenities you could need or ask for .  They are however currently undergoing construction in many of the area and it was very  noisy and hard to work during the day. At some point the sawing they were doing on the walls of the adjacent room cause us to lose power on one wall as well
20,The room rate was a big factor in my decision to stay there and as they say you get what you paid for. I've been to Vegas plenty of times and the Luxor reminded me of the Imperial Palace before it was taken over by a different company dirty dingy and in serious need of an upgrade. I thought that the Luxor (being an MGM property) would be of better quality. This was not the case. The check-in process was so long because they did not have enough staff checking guests in. Our room was ok but we did have a clogged sink which was not fixed until the last day of our stay. The hotel aesthetics just screamed 1970's. I think next time I will spend a lot of money to stay at either an Air B & B or a property I know has been recently renovated. Props to housekeeping for cleaning our room daily.
20,"I was staying here for my wife and mines wedding pre honeymoon with some friends arrival was good staff was friendly. on the way to the room there were dirty walls smudged everything looked very nasty.    On entering our suite we had old fashioned AC's (being a ""Renovated suite"" as advertised yet our friend staying in the regular room had a thermostat old televisions with nothing to watch (50 channels maybe? only interesting channel was MTV) Picture quality was dastardly room was slightly dirty elevators old and creaking it felt like being on the titanic every time we used it and would stop on random floors and go up and down even though we scanned the card.    Staying here made me think ""What the heck am I paying for? I wanted to stay in a hotel not a glorified motel 6"" the staff was VERY friendly and nice and the hotel is great to visit but I will NEVER stay here again. Hope they improve my best advice to anyone who stays here is to ask for a room by the elevator trust me if you don't you will be SORRY."
20,The rooms were very outdated and subpar. Nothing special to them at all. Our room didn’t have hot water for the entire duration of our stay. There was no fridge. The room turn over was incomplete and we weren’t provided with shampoo & conditioner. You can hear the music playing in the casino through your room door. Given the price there is a lot of better hotels on the strip to stay at.
30,I had a nice stay at Luxor. Her room was very quiet and the location of the hotel is very good. However looks or it’s definitely showing it’s age and is dirty inside and out. In the past Luxor was a unique and fun place to visit. Much of the decor that made it unique is gone and once you are inside it looks the same as every other older casino on the strip.
40,Overall good hotel lots of activities and experiences to see and do. Good location on the strip that is within walking distance of many “must see” spots. Room experience was alright nothing to glamorous for the price.
20,CHECK IN WAS EXTREMELY LONG when we got to our room the bathroom had no electricity called several times nothing was ever done we had to take a shower and use the bathroom in the dark that is unacceptable and for over 300 hundred dollars a night way overpricd
10,There were no shampoo and bath mat in the room when we arrived. Comparing with other hotels is cheap and that’s why we shouldn’t expect perfect stay there. I did my check in and out with my phone and it was very easy and fast.
30,Since we were going to the Redskins/Raiders game the location was excellent. The buffet was pretty solid. The room was clean but the walls were paper thin. Could hear EVERYTHING in the room next door. Terrible for sleep.
10,We were sleeping and got woken up by tile being done by a construction crew right above our room. We couldn't relax or even speak to each other because It was so loud. Yes they put us in another room. But why the heck were we even in the one we were in when they knew very well this was going to happen? So inconvenient to have to pick up all of our stuff and head out somewhere else. It was horrible. I don't ever want to stay here again.
20,We woke up one day and had no hot water. I called twice over a few hour later and it was not resolved until late that night. It happened again two day later and it was not resolved.  We also prepaid for our room before our arrival x when we checked in they charged us another $35 per night and we were told it was a resort fee. No other members in our family was charged this fee. It was not resolved either.
50,Let's face it most of the major casino hotels are 20-30 years old now there's always going to be small issues it's how a hotel handles the big stuff. Luxor is pretty well maintained the staff are excellent the rings are spacious and clean. Uber/Lyft is very convenient (some girls make it a real issue getting ride share).  Overall it's a very good hotel for a reasonable price.
10,For a “comp” room our 2 were pretty terrible. We gladly would’ve paid more for something else. Literally anything else. Room was outdated and needed some much needed tlc. At the end of the day you won’t get a “good deal” receiving a comped room from Luxor :(
50,We stayed at the Luxor in premier suite on the pyramid side early Dec 2021. After encountering problems with pot smell coming into our room from past visits we were extremely pleased to not have had this visit. Appears Luxor is taking steps to control.    The room (29100) was larger than premier suites we stayed in previously. Nice sized dining room area and sit up bar. 1 large closet with full length mirror doors was good feature. Additional 1/2 bath in living room space nice especially if have guests. Only issue with pyramid side of hotel is always the elevator ride as it goes up at an angle and a different experience. Food at Back Stage Deli GREAT as was Pyramid Cafe and Diablos. Buffet was good for price but not available in evenings.
10,The service didn't show up after multiple calls.  The front desk was answering not in appropriate way i couldn't hear them and ahe was not even trying yo help me.  The checkout day parking elevator is out of service
50,We loved our stay there.  Everything was perfect ! Except maybe the restaurants in the hotel not very good…  But that was a good reason to go find something outside :)  We had an health issue with our friend but the staff was reactive/friendly.  The pool is also cool.
20,I have stayed at the Luxor before though it has been about 8 years. For this trip we chose to stay in the Luxor purely for the novelty of staying in the pyramid since my husband had never been there before. We reserved a suite and were specifically looking forward to the soaking tub with a view. For this we were willing to give up being more centrally located to the Strip.    Instead we got downgraded to a boring room in the Towers with the only view being the back of a pillar. This was even though we booked directly through the MGM site not through a third party.    To add to this: 1) We used the app to check in. It told us we were successfully checked in but then never gave us a room number so we had to wait through the check in line anyway. 2) When we did finally get to a room we had to call for security to take us to our floor because the elevator was broken and kept skipping our floor. 3) One of the two elevator down call buttons on our floor didn't work. 4) The tram from Excalibur was not stopping at Luxor but there was no signage and no one had said anything about it. 5) Most of the moving walkways weren't working meaning we had to walk extra far to get to any of the fun stuff on the strip (which may have been worth it if our room was nicer but in this case it added insult to injury). 6) We were given food and beverage credit for our trouble. We went to the desk to ask where specifically we could use it and were given the room key paper holder and told we could use it at any of the MGM properties listed on the back. On checkout we found out that was not true it was only good in the Luxor.    Overall it was a horrible experience. For being our first trip in nearly two years and a birthday celebration at that our choice to stay in the Luxor really let us down.
30,Hotel location is very good. Easy walk to many places many shows and a few restaurants on premise inside walkway to Mandalay Bay shops and restaurants. Inclinator lifts are cool but feel old and rickety. Standard room is adequate but bare-bones.
10,Reserved a Premium King Pyramid room. Checked in around 3:30 and they had a hard time finding a room for us. After finally settling in the room carpet was extremely dirty and sticky with noticeable spills and tracked all over. Should never had been allowed to rent out.
20,I was attending a dance competition at Luxor and forgot my key last night. I had with me 2 credit cards with my name. Meanwhile my partner started with a migraine and was suffering badly. I had to go get Advil and something for him to eat but.. I could not get upstairs because of the stupid elevator system only works with the key. Went to the reception last night and explained the situation. Asked for a second key. The receptionist wouldn’t give me one because I had no ID. I told him I understood but I had both credit cards with my name on. It didn’t matter. I said my husband was suffering badly and he needed me immediately. I asked him to be escorted upstairs. He did not care or even listened!! He did not offer any other help because I had no ID on me.  If my husband would be having a heart attack what would have happened? I am not happy at all with the way I was treated by the receptionist or is lack of willingness to help/listen to me.  Will never stay again if I can avoid it. Please change the elevator system. It is too dangerous for a situation like this.
50,Loves our stay. Great food and service. And slots were winning!!! Will happily stay there again. Weather was cold so we hopped over to Mandalay Bay. Nice that it was an easy walk inside. Can’t wait to come visit again!!
40,Room Where nice sized and clean . It’s a little hard to get around from  Parking and we had to carry a week worth of stuff from cars to check in said we couldn’t park at drop off point so that was kind of a hassle
50,Luxor is the hotel with outstanding service. People here can have business fun or rest. In all cases the people will meet professionals who provide outstanding service. All members of Luxor team provide service with politeness kindness patience and compassion. For example registration staff explains all details for room reservation check-in and check-out. If guests apply with questions to any staff in Luxor they will obtain answers and help. Moreover staff will help you to be found if you are lost. For example I was lost when I looked for the parking place and my room. All staff around helped me to park my car and find the location of my room. I was so impressed! Luxor staff is very friendly! Also staff have diversity awareness. They help people who don't know English well. Staff explain everything with patience talk slowly and repeat everything if necessary. All guests are treated with respect. Luxor is the hotel with outstanding service.
40,Nice hotel. There are nicer hotels that are closer to everything downtown. I enjoyed staying their but I would stay closer to downtown. The Luxor buffet was unimpressive. I enjoyed Caesar Palace’s buffet and Bellagio’s buffet
40,The room was spacious and clean. If only the digital key would’ve worked. After talking with many people they experienced the same thing. The staff was quite friendly and willing to answer any questions.
30,DON'T EAT THE $25 PER PERSON BUFFET. IT IS NOT FIT TO EAT. Rooms are cheap but very outdated. I have seen nicer furniture at goodwill but it was clean ( I think). It was so old I wondered how you get a 100 year old carpet clean. Casino paid off good so I guess I shouldn't complain. Hard to get drinks while gambling but I think that is everywhere right now.
50,Great rooms for a great price. Staff is amazing checked in quickly without waiting long lines. You can even make your own keys! Definitely recommend if you’re looking to recharge or even just have fun with the family.
50,"both first and 2nd times to Vegas at the Luxor were good after a few days over a ""6 night stay"" I was checked up on by housekeeping with a call asking if i needed anything ""i had opted out of house keeping service sense I'm a house keeper myself and know how to keep my room clean. It was nice receiving a check up call instead of waking me up with a knock at the door as I usly sleep during days"
30,Things started out poor the spa treatment was outstanding Public House food was awesome. Guest walking up and down the hallway being loud was uncalled for it’s like the walls are paper thin. I thought we were booking a room in the Pyramid turns out we were in the East Tower.
40,I liked the comfort of the hotel and theme of the hotel. The available service was there but the staff made no effort to make me feel any better than the other people that were there. Just a little effort would have hit a home run with me
10,Upon arrival front desk yelled at me telling me she would call when she was ready and that I needed to go back to the line. Upon stay in room we had no hot water the first day a/c was broken and our friends room flooded due to plumbing issues. Staff around the casino weren’t friendly at all ended up going to other casinos for friendly faces.
20,Wife’s Birthday had A whole 3 Nights stay planned and paid for. Upgraded room to Corner king Penthouse. Paid for Guarantee early check in at 11:00. By 1:30 Room was still not ready and had no idea when it will be done. Don’t give customer an option to pay for A Guarantee early check in if you can’t deliver.
20,Hotel is run down. The shower does not have a door and will flood the floor after a shower. The elevators are dangerous. We kept on hearing them making loud booming noises. While inside they were shaking. Also if seemed like when you called an elevator only one would work. All the others would go past your floor without stopping. And it happened intermittently. So give yourself some time to get out of your room to the lobby and vice versa.
20,Roos are not what they look like on websitestaff not friendlyeverything over price service delivered does not match with prices drinks at the casino were awful. Would not recommend to stay here. Location was the only good thing
30,We had an enjoyable time. But the mattress was so hard. It seems a bit dated in the hallways. I don’t really know what else to say. 200 words is too many. I think most people could fit it in in 50 words or less
10,After returning from NFR on Wednesday our room had been Robbed. Security accused us of not locking door Hotel MGR accused us of not locking door. We know it was shut when we left. Manager did everything he could to upset us so he could say we were a problem and hung up on me. They are very versed at getting rid of you when they have a problem. They must have used a wire under the door. After speaking to others several others were also robbed that week and that day. Luxor and MGM could not care less what happened no liability for them we were on 22nd floor of west tower only key card access. MGR and Security would not tell us anything about who was on the floor from the time we left and came back No one has contacted us in past three days..
10,Stayed here with my wife for our wedding anniversary no water in our tub suite. Room had stains all over the carpet and walls when we turned on our black light. Tried to get them to move us to another hotel when I brought up that I had taken pictures of everything wrong with the room the front desk then said I need to leave the hotel as pictures are not permitted to be taken on there property. Yeah okay…. We left this dump after all there BS. Best advice I have is to avoid this place.
50,The trip at Luxor was great. Clean rooms good service. We were alittle dissatisfied that even though we had rooms there was a $26 daily charge on parking. The food places shut down early and like us saw many people trying to locate somewhere to eat. So we would go get food to go and sit in the Luxor food court and eat it. Many asked where to go get food. Unlike the past when you could eat at any time.
40,Great stay at the hotel. We were in a refurbished king room in the pyramid. Furnishings really nice and was clean. Only thing to warn is the shower screen isn’t long enough. Luckily on day two our maid left us 2 towels for the floor as otherwise there was no way to avoid water going over floor. Other than that we had a great experience!
30,"We booked at the Luxor because there was an activity a family member signed up for at the hotel.  We were not pleased with our stay. The AC was deficient in the room the fan is set up to ""auto"" making the room hot and cold all through the night.  The safe in the room was locked and we couldn't get anyone to open it over our 3-night stay. I personally spoke with 4 different hotel staff.  Lastly there was not a mini-fridge in the room to keep milk juice cold that we purchased on our drive into town.  Overall not a pleasant stay."
40,Great casino for the price point. The rooms were good but the elevators were a whole different issues. We like the location and staff. The food is good at Luxor and really like the way to access the other casinos.
10,It is a low rate hotel and if you care for high quality rooms and customer service this should not be your 1st choice. This hotel  Needs get a facelift from inside out. The best part of this hotel is the connection to Mandalay by not having to go outside. I guess it is a good place if you are on a budget.
20,The casino / resort was barely open. Very few gambling tables in operation. Most restaurants were closed slow service at the few that were open. Room had few towels and no refrigerator. I won't be going back even though it was less expensive.
10,No heat in my room and very small bedding. NO mini fridge. NO coffee machine and NO microwave. Felt more like a motel in a casino. Every time I was in the elevator with someone the way the elevator shook was the dominant subject.
10,will not stay here again. i listed all my problems with the room earlier in the survey. gouged scratched and damaged furniture looked like out. outlets are garbage. chairs were old and stained brown all over. elevators are hell. theyre overcrowded and do whatever they want. button plates to call elevator are smashed in and dirty.
30,Not sure what resort fees are for at $35 per day. You still have to pay $15 per day for parking. Room was somewhat clean. There was still makeup on the bathroom floor from the previous people. Good and drinks are super expensive. Almost $9 for 1 bottle of beer. Exhibits are worth it.
50,Rooms are very nice love the modern aesthetic of the rooms very clean as well beds are comfortable and room service was great over all great stay with the pricing i really recomend this hetel to stay.
20,The mobile app to check in did not work so hundreds of us had to wait in line to check in which took a long time. Also I did not receive a final bill for check out. Most hotel automatically email you one but apparently not the Luxor. I checked out almost a week ago and am still waiting to receive a bill so I can submit my expense report. It is impossible to reach anyone by phone. This hotel was considerably more expensive than most on the strip and I only stay there because the location was convenient for my business purpose. I stayed at the Paris earlier in the week and the price was a fraction of the Luxor and the service was excellent!
50,The Luxor is conveniently located on the strip. There are numerous decent priced restaurants conveniently located on/near the hotel. The Luxor offers a wide variety of gaming activities however more they have reduced the number of progressive video poker machines.
20,As I’ve already said needs renovation ASAP.  DIABLOs was awful waste of money and ingredients.  Investment necessary to bring LUXOR to original royalty!  The saving food grace was FOOD COURT neat clean and good food.
40,When I got to my hotel room after I got checked in finally. I walked in and my room was completely disgusting. There was garbage that was still there from the previous guests. Used soap in the shower. The beds were still all messed up and there was stuff on the pillows of some matter. And the room did not smell that great.
10,They charge 25 bucks a night to rent a fridge! The have a hole in the cabinet where the fridge should be! No bottled water in the rooms. They charge for a late check out! Air was not working in the room. Had to call for service.
10,Booked a room with a king a month prior to stay and upon arrival was told no king beds available and to check again tomorrow. This backwards thinking and we won't be staying there again. Prices were too high and not even a room comp.
10,Multiple items were stolen from my room. Money AirPods etc etc. What’s the point of staying at this hotel if your items are not safe!? Awful experience! Better hotels out there. I’ve learned in the hard way. Room old smelly terrible!
10,Elevators shook like they were about to launch. Time share people everywhere. Meals in restaurants were awful. Assistants on casino floor were hard to find. I would rather be on the street than at this place
20,My issue is with the room. We stayed in a corner room in the pyramid 0640. The room was old and poorly furnished straight out of the 1980s. Jacuzzi in the room broken light fixtures old musty carpets worn-out bedding - all for a $1200 grand total for a weekend. At this price I would expect better accommodations. No complaints about the staff.
20,The room was freezing. There's no refrigerator microwave or coffeemaker. They want you to go downstairs and go to Starbucks or one of their restaurants. Hotel is runned down . Will not stay here again
10,Rude employees from start to finish. No real customer service at all especially toward 1st time Vegas goers. No real great about casino. Seems very confused on what it wants to be decor wise. Not a fan.
50,I Love the way trip pair the price and comfort like a favorite private broker.Relax and enjoy the best hotel in Las Vegas without the uncertainty of being disappointed.Take plenty of photos because this definitely a night to remember.
10,"Room was so dirty. Some of ""that liquid and curly hairs"" were still on the tables (iwwww). We called front desk multiple times to request a housekeeper and had to waste 1.5 hours waiting in the room for her to come to clean the room for us. Also Luxor rejected to switch us for another room. Totally not feel safe when staying there. Very disappointed!"
10,The property is great but the staff is generally apathetic and doesn’t care to handle obligations that reservations says would be met. The gaming and the rooms themselves were not horrible but the staff would be reason not to stay there again.
50,The Luxor is a pyramid shaped jewel on the Las Vegas strip. The friendly service is world class without paying $100’s a night. The waitress’ are among the best in Vegas and I couldn’t recommend The Luxor any more!
40,A really impressive hotel. The inside of the hotel is something that takes your breath away especially if you are on a higher floor. Plenty of restaurants to pick from. Located at the bottom of the main strip so is a pretty long walk up the strip if you’ve never been to Vegas before then things take longer to walk to than Google Maps says! The lifts are really cool but it does take quite some time just to even get out of your room and onto the street. Internal tunnels to get to the next door hotels Mandalay Bay and Excalibur which was handy as my excursion to the Grand Canyon picked me up from Excalibur. The bed was probably the most comfy bed I have ever slept on and had 2 big beds in my room. Plenty of storage space and a large safe in the bedside unit. Good view from my room of the Sphinx however the hotel is right next to the runway of the airport so be prepared to hear planes landing and taking off. The TV selection was pretty poor but the WiFi was fast and free. I had a late flight and was able to change to a later check out which was appreciated. In terms of the casino I am not a gambler so I can’t really comment on that however it as absolutely huge but well signposted so I knew where I was going. All in all a pretty good hotel.
50,I used the MGM app to check in at the Luxor which was very fast easy and convenient. No standing in long lines! The room was clean and staff was really nice. Checking out was just a press of a button in the app and I was on my way.
10,There were SERIOUS issues at the onset of our check-in that was NOT resolved until after over half of our complete stay! It was our very 1st time in Vegas (we were there to get married) and we ON PURPOSE chose the Luxor for reasons that we now know are not consistent with what we actually experienced!!! Although there was an attempt to rectify the situation it was NOT satisfactory and we are looking to get FULL restitution in the very near future!!!!!!!  ---Dr. Perry & Family
50,Had a great experience at the Luxor. Only problem we had is one of the three rooms we had didn't have heat so they had to be moved. Instead of being moved to the same section that we were all in they got moved to a different tower. Little inconvenient but not a big problem . The Luxor was very clean and we enjoyed our stay.
10,Upon arriving to our room across the hall from our room was this little area that had a bunch of empty beer bottles and trash. We stayed 3 nights and it never got cleaned up. In the first night I tried to call down because our remote didn't work and to request an extra pillow. I had to go down to the desk because I couldn't get through. They put in a request to housekeeping and 20 minutes later I baked down to housekeeping because noone had showed up yet they said someone was on their way about 15min later someone finally came. They brought a new remote that still didn't work. He said he would put in a work order. We didn't have a remote or entire stay. Elevator 3 smelled like raw sewage starting the second morning.
10,What a terrible experience. The Luxor was the worst hotel I’ve ever been to. The room was dirty and had a big wet spot the tub and shower were both dirty the sheets had weird stains on them. We tried to overlook all of that and enjoy ourselves anyways. Come back to the room after being out walking and exploring all day go to take a shower before we soak and there is no water. In the entire hotel. I had just spilled a chocolate milkshake all over my brand new dress and couldn’t even wash it out because there wasnt any water. Obviously we are upset and go down to the front desk and talk to them about the issues we were having. Keep in mind this is our wedding anniversary. Front desk basically says yeah the water goes off daily sometimes we will take of resort fees but that’s it. I want a shower. I want to relax and soak. I can’t do any of these things and I have a dirty room to boot. My husband then preceded to inform the front desk person that we had video documentation on everything that was wrong. They then asked us to leave the hotel and casino completely and had security follow us to our room to get our belongings. So now it’s 3am I’m sitting in front of the Luxor with my bags with nowhere to go or stay. We had to change our flight and pay the difference so we could get home on the earliest flight they had. Which was still 4 hours from then. I will never return!!
50,There wasnt a fridge or microwave in our room but everything else about our room was perfect. The food wasn’t priced too bad compared to all the other places on the strip and the casino had fun slots. Luxor is connected to a mall and there is so much shopping you can do. The America’s Got Talent Show was definitely a memorable experience!
40,I love how the front desk help make my first time experience very pleasant. The gentleman was very friendly & very helpful in giving us information on how to get around. The rooms are decent & the ambiance was very Egyptian loved it.
30,Staff was not helpful or polite. We felt like we were bothering them with questions. The rooms were nice. You need to request a coffee maker and refrigerator. We stayed for 3 nights. This was our first experience with Luxor. We usual stay at MGM Grand Excalibur and New York New York. Don't know if I'll stay at Luxor and it sucks that it's owed by MGM.
50,the beds were very comfortable and so was room temp this was at the tower section. the pyramid section had a scary elevator but the kids loved it! ithink the location is perfect! would stay there over and over
50,2 room suite in the east tower was a nice place to stay except the pool hours are limited so it was closed during our stay. I do think it’s open limited hours on the weekends. The cafe had had good food and make sure to check out the food court on 2nd floor. Didn’t find that until after a few days of staying there.
50,Room was very beautiful and clean. Staff was friendly and very easy check in. I can’t wait to stay again. Beautiful views from the window. Casino was great. Plenty of parks how ever you have to pay for parking.
50,Everything was perfect and everything was clean everyone was nice recommended to stay again amazing people amazing service food was great drinks were on point poolside was clean the stay was amazing would stay again
30,The buffet was closed. I ended up going to Diablo Mexican restaurant to get a $25. Meal which was terrible.Also the 4pm check in time is terrible. We check in at 4pm and are told to check out at 11am.
50,Great place to stay if going to a Raiders game…easy access and convenient. We stayed in the Tower…rooms were very nice…had some ‘activity’ in Men’s bathroom near entrance. Water would turn on by itself. Even if you were in the next sink. It did it several times and it felt like someone would sit at the end of our bed at night. Would definitely stay there again
10,Old beds old rooms ghetto. Totally disappointed for th the price we paid.  Will never waste my money at the Luxor.  Staff were great. Breakfast was ok.  Again I cannot stress how terrible the rooms were!
50,Since our flight was at night time our room was giving away in the pyramid section so the gentleman us that he would give us the a suit also in the tower section. We told him. we don't like the towers because it feels like a maze and it's very hard to find the room but the room he gave us was just perfect. It was not hard to find it. My husband and I enjoyed ourselves so much.
50,I was there for an event at Allegiant Stadium. The entire experience was bar-none and that’s not because my team won! The availability of digital services made my stay wholly contact free outside bar/lounge service. Interactions with staff were great! Very fun place to be.
20,Room service was horrible had to call and request service everyday for 5 entire days. When they showed the job was half done. The beds were very uncomfortable and sheets weren’t changed properly. They elevator would not accept virtual key card.
50,First time in Vegas loved every moment of it even though it was just 1day. Will plan a longer trip next time and will pick Luxor again to stay in. Great place to stay staff was very professional and courteous.
50,First time I stayed at the Luxor. Staff was good. Food was great. Casino was good. I have been to Vegas 14-0 times. Luxor is not top of the Casinos they treat you good as long as you gamble. So they treated me great.
50,Very enjoyable stay. Only stayed 2 nights but my room was clean and nice. Close to the places I wanted to go. They accommodated me by putting me and my family members rooms close together so we were close when going out.
30,We paid for a night and were comped 2. You still pay a resort fee per night. Rooms were not clean and showers did not drain well. You definitely get what you pay for. It’s a good Go-To hotel when on a budget!
50,Easy stay helpful staff clean rooms  Valet and bell staff seem to be more eager to help than at other hotels.    If you had a question or problem it was immediately answered or solved  Just an easy stay
50,All I can say was it was my bday get away And I would come back in a heartbeat No questions asked  I love Luxor staff friendly very helpful When I had a question there was always someone there . I was very satisfied…
20,Not up to the MGM standards you'd expect. This hotel looks old and the decor could have been themed better as it is supposed to be ancient Egyptian style. The only good things are location bed comfort and shower pressure and temp. But for what you pay you could stay in a nicer hotel on the strip.
20,The water in this hotel is awful. After three days my hair was gummy and my color fading out. When I complained they acted indifferent. But did move me to a floor where they actually use filters. Hmm they must know then.  They implied that was all over town. Not anywhere else I have stayed.
10,When booking my trip I reserved the Pyramid Corner King Suite in which I had to settle for a Queen Suite. Upon arrival I noticed the bathroom floor being wet. I dried it with a towel only to wake up the next morning to the floor being wet again. I then realized that the leak was coming from the base of the toilet. The bathroom sink faucet was leaking also. There was a nasty hard stain in carpet in the sitting area.. Unacceptable.
50,I stayed here my first time in Vegas and others who've been to Vegas thought I was having a luxurious stay. My second time I stayed alone but I really enjoyed myself! It's at the end of the strip but that's the best part because there's only one other direction to walk in and it's not as loud outside due to the nightlife.
30,It’s a great on strip resort that won’t break the bank for a fun Vegas stay. I recommend staying in the pyramid but the tower rooms are also very nice as well. Lots to do here and the south end of the strip is great for anyone with families.
50,We had a really good stay at The Luxor! Had fun playing on the slot machines and enjoyed the Buffet. Wish it were open later than 3:00 pm but hopefully that will change as time goes on and recovery from Covid improves. We like the location of The Luxor too. It is an easy walk to visit other casinos for a change of pace. Very clean room with a super comfortable bed. I slept better on this trip than I have in years when sleeping in a hotel.
10,"When I checked in (very late on Saturday night) and went to my room I was met with a ""furnace"" type of heat coming from the room. Thermostat said 72 but was much much hotter. I then found the carpet to be sopping wet (more than 50% coverage was in this condition). I thought the carpet must have been steam cleaned and maintenance left the heat on in attempt to dry it out. I was so tired I figured I would just go to sleep and ask for a room change in the morning. Despite my turning the thermostat down to 60 (lowest it would go) my room didn't cool enough to sleep until 8 am. To make it worse all through the night I kept noticing the smell of the wet carpet; it smelled closer to sewer water than carpet shampoo. I truly believe there must be a leaky pipe under room 1206. Next morning I was given a different room of course and offered $75 in food/bev credit as recompense. I already had meal plans off-site for the day though and was checking out at night for a red-eye flight so never got to spend a penny of it. Seriously worst hotel stay I've had anywhere and will only recommend people NOT stay here to avoid the same risk."
10,Was not a good experience from the start.... they don't tell you you have ti pay for parking in the price until you pay... then the digital parking pass didn't work the gate to park. We had people honking horns at us because we we stuck there.... then the digital code would not work the elevator.... so we proceed to get key cards... they worked the elevator but would not open the room... then had to go back to desk wait in the long to get the card reprogrammed... it literally took over an hour and a half JUST to get into the room!!
40,Location is close and walking distance the the Allegiant Stadium. Would stay again when visiting the stadium. The little deli was a plus was able to get a decent breakfast and the line wasn’t long. Friendly staff
40,Hotel looks awesome from the outside but the room amenities and linens were not adequate and poor quality. It is somewhat clen not up to the mark. Check in took linger than expected. Parking was too far from the hotel.
10,Please beware of this hotel I went to this hotel for my honeymoon it was my first time in Vegas I wanted to have a good time and my main issue was which the extra charges that was charged to my bank account I was very upset because these charges were randomly and they will charge you multiple times and when I brought it up to management attention it seem like I was a bother stay away from this resort and beware from this budget resort in Las Vegas
50,Great hotel with a pretty unique floor plan. It’s kept spotless at all times and has a pretty awesome casino area as well as accommodating and courteous staff! There are plenty of restaurant and shopping options inside and in the immediate area as well. I had a very enjoyable time staying here!
30,We booked a suite and it was very bare compared to others I’ve stayed in. One mirror in a two room suite is not enough. No coffee pot forcing us to buy Starbucks. No microwave but we had a refrigerator. Room seemed outdated.
40,Outdated room no coffeemakers microwaves or mini refrigerators in the rooms. Good place to just sleep. Friendly and helpful staff. Valet service was worth the $30.00 per day (on the weekend). Food in the cafe wasn't very good both times we ate there it was cold. Get a car so you can see more of Vegas and NV.
40,I loved staying here especially because it was so close to allegiant stadium! Just needed to work in elevator wait time! But overall very great service and clean rooms! Casinos great too and restaurants amazing and delicious! Food was 11 out of 10!
40,The location is great. It's close to the airport and at a good location on the strip. The room was decent there was a light switch problem in the bathroom that kept the light on 24/7 which didn't really cause any problems but was annoying in the middle of the night. There are plenty of food options in the hotels food court and on the casino floor. Overall a great stay.
50,Overall good stay casino was good the new sports book it was great also lol seems like the odds were better on the slot machines back when I came in February other than that good stay Would definitely recommend you stay in here if you’re going to go to the raider game it’s a very short walk
30,The online check in and electronic room key was nice. We were missing the mini fridge in the room which lead to food being thrown away and wasted. It was a great location for heading out to the tailgating beer garden and short walk over to Allegiant Stadium for a Raiders game.
30,The hotel rooms offer no additional amenities like fridges or coffee makers. Staff is unaware of timings for exhibits resulting in us missing opportunities to partake. Food was lack luster in quality and taste. Overall it was a disappointing stay.
40,Good but pricey almost 300 for one night. Our floor was not mopped and could have used extra pillows. No fridge. Room was nice overall would recommended because it’s right on the strip. Room was nice but the Lighting sucked it was dark/ dim except for the bathroom.
20,Our room was not cleaned very well. There was lipstick on glasses from previous stay. The beds were not very comfortable. If I were to go back I would not stay here again. Hope this helps someone else looking hotels.
40,This trip was definitely better than our last trip back in February.    We came to support our team in the Pac12 Championship game. We chose the Luxor based on its proximity to the stadium.    Overall it was definitely an enjoyable weekend. Great location. Friendly and informative staff.    My only knock is that it seems like the hotel needs to look at some upgrades to the rooms.    Our couch in our suite felt like you were going to fall through to the floor. Carpet and bathroom old and outdated.    There is talk that they're going to build a MLB stadium across the street. If this is true MGM needs to update some of its older hotels.    This would be the 3rd major sporting venue amongst their hotel dominance within walking distance.
10,asking extra $20 for your car to wait for valet. When i talked to the check in counter they dont know anything about it they gave me an upgraded room instead which is a basic bed  table and TV. I wonder what was the not upgraded room
50,Luxor was very clean and had excellent service. I especially loved the pillows. It's usually hard for me to sleep but their pillows were so comfortable that I was able to knock out the moment I ready to sleep.
50,Good service and staff only thing is that they need more restaurant maybe like bk or mi Donalds dominoes pizza and the food court is not that really easy to find its at the back corner of the upper  deck
30,Hotel is good but it need few improvements like for instants more signs specially restroom are hard to fine and also restroom needs to improve the cleanliness.The room is great and sleep like a baby. Parking is tough probably need more parking for you or guess or guess parking can be added. Overall it was a blast and hope to come back soon.
30,Great value but horrible check in experience. This is the second time in a row I've had a bad experience checking into a mgm property. Hope they can get it together soon because they have some properties that I would like to stay in
50,Staff was awesome location was convenient. You need to call for a refrigerator to be delivered but it’s no biggie. They had it up to us within 15 min of checking in. Good table prices downstairs like I said can’t go wrong
30,The place was dirty. The elevator was scary and falling apart. The room was dirty and had empty pill bottles and other debris behind the dresser. The elevators had dirt and debris and were very slow. I would not stay here again.
20,The wife and I had a concert at Park MGM. Being from Las Vegas we figured we’d stay at the Luxor for convenience purposes. I would recommend checking in on the MLife app otherwise it will be a while. Also print your room key because there’s no service when you get in the elevator to use your digital room key. The room was so so. Nothing special. Ours had a spot where the fridge was suppose to be. They actually had last call at the bars…in Vegas and the buffet was disgusting and way over priced for the quality of food. I questioned wether I should be eating the food but I still had a buzz the next morning and desperate people do desperate things. I would only recommend staying at the Luxor for its proximity to the surrounding properties and the Allegiant Stadium.
40,Enjoyed the Hotel's location. Never had to deal with the front desk did the early check-in on the MGM App. So bypassing the front desk made things so much easier for me. Room didn't have a refrigerator or a hair dryer
50,The staff was extremely helpful even with a busy crowd. Rooms were clean and had a great view of Vegas. I never felt like I needed anything or was short on any part of my experience. The bar in the middle of the casino also had amazing bartenders that made exceptional drinks for my and my buddy.
10,We checked in on Saturday night after Thanksgiving. Upon arrival valet had signs up that parking was full. I drove over to the self parking and security had the entrance blocked off. I made the block and still was not able to park. I came back over to valet and was approved by attendant. He asked if I was staying and for $10.00 he would park our vehicle. I came out the next morning and was hit with the $30.00 valet charge. No one was interested in what happened the night before. Our room was dirty and housekeeping would not respond.
10,The Luxor used to be very nice and one of my top picks. Not anymore! The rooms and run down and very dirty! The tile was busted up outside the elevator on our floor and instead of fixing it they just placed a caution cone on the top of it. There was no available parking for guests because Luxor allows allegiant stadium to use up all of their parking so we had to walk and carry our luggage from a neighboring hotel. Overall a really bad experience at this hotel.
40,This is a great hotel for the value. Great place to stay if you are here for a concert or football game at allegiance stadium. I would definitely stay again. Just wish Vegas would stop allowing cigarette smoke inside.
50,The hotel was nice not much people as at the north of strip but still good live entertainment would be nice at the hotel and the casino like live band. The food court should stayed open late hotel  Staff was very nice although difficult to reach over the phone.
50,If you're going to Vegas and want a fairly priced really nice place to stay this is it. The pyramid is remarkable the people treat you right the gaming is good and the restaurants have wide variety. If you need a more pretentious place MGM resorts has other choices but the pyramid has always been great for me.
50,Great location friendly service good dining options clean and comfortable rooms. No safe no fridge no microwave no coffee pot. Atmosphere was very lively and the drinks kept coming. Couple machines were paying!
30,Housekeeping will clean more than just your room they will clean out(steal) your personal items😡 It only takes one negative experience to ruin a yearly stay. Makes me wonder if any of the MGM resorts hotel can be trustedt🤔
50,Stayed at different casinos and the Luxor always makes me feel like I’m at home in my own bed. Food is great and staff is very friendly. Pit bosses are always friendly and remember your name will return soon
40,I had a very pleasant stay at the Luxor. The staff were very friendly and always wanting to help you if needed. I enjoyed the atmosphere. The Pyramid Cafe has good food. If you're looking for a nice place to stay while in Las Vegas this is it.
30,There is no explanation on the shower I don't have words except the design was extremly poor and has to be changed. The bed sheets and pillows was excellent. The room was clean and we were staying for a football game at the Allegiant Stadium and this is a good place to stay if that is your goal.
40,I had a great time with my family. Very very clean. Would go back but wished it was a little less expensive. The cleaning staff was prompt and great. We dont go that often to Vegas would like to go more if less expensive.
40,The hotel was good overall as far as entertainment within the hotel there wasn't very much apart from a few shows. It was a convenient walk to surrounding hotels as well as the Strip so there was lots to do outside of the hotel itself. The place was kept clean and staff was very friendly. Overall would recommend.
30,The pool was not open. Had to use pool at Mandalay Bay. If all services/amenities aren’t available offer a reduced resort fee for the inconvenience. Advertise tram service to the neighboring resorts. Didn’t see any signs inside resort
10,No refrigerator. No coffee maker. Balloons and tape found in area that there very clearly used to be a refrigerator. Was the room properly cleaned? They used towels as door stops for the elevator area. For Almost $300 a night you would think they could afford door stops.
10,Stayed at the Luxor for 4 nights. Room was dirty (floor stained pillow). The entire time we were there the hallway and room smelled like sewer we contacted the staff multiple times and nothing was ever done. I will never stay here again.
10,Went to Luxor and room was not clean. There was pee on toilet underneath. There was hair and old q-tip in sink area and hair by shower. Not at all happy with room amenities either. No microwave or mini fridge for a premium room you would think they would. Will not stay there again.
50,The environment was very friendly and I loved the Egyptian statues. The tram was fun to ride on and the rooms were cleaned when we needed without asking also the pyramid cafe has an amazing breakfast.
40,Rooms were not very clean especially the bathrooms. We had 5 rooms booked to celebrate our daughter's wedding at the Bellagio. Unfortunately the day of the event another daughter's room was robbed. I could not fully address that situation although security came up and took a report. We are still waiting for loss prevention to rectify the loss.  The wedding was beautiful but now I have to deal with the robbery.
10,Booked this trip 11 months ago.  Was not given room I was promised and only found out when I got there (there is no excuse given the amount of time)    Unruly neighbors 1st night. I had requested to change rooms as I didn’t want to deal with being woken up at 3am every night    2nd room also had unruly neighbors and they were coughing all night. During a pandemic that didn’t sit right with me. Neighbors also stole our do not disturb sign because they were lazy.    Cheap room so you get what you pay for. Spend the extra money and stay at a nicer hotel.
10,We opted for a upgraded suite due to having 3 adults in the room. Our first room was beautiful but didn’t have the requested double beds. We were offered a roll away or to go speak to the front desk.  We were moved to a old suite that smelled musty and the AC needed to constantly run to keep the smell away. There were torn pieces of bandaids on the wall and getting even warm water was a wait of over 10+ minutes. Super disappointed in the room after booking such a beautiful looking room.
40,Title of the review speaks for itself. Incredible they would be pounding the walls and drilling at 8:30am. Power failures being charged for valet when it is supposed to be included. Not a pleasant stay at all.
20,"I chose Luxor because it was a short walk to the stadium for the football game so great location for that. It is an older property and showing it's age a little I have stayed here in the past so I was familiar with it. At check in I was given a room in the east tower rather than what I had reserved being told other rooms weren't ready. It may be that location is maybe the ""party"" area? It was very noisy at night even though I turned in at 2 am or later so it's a good thing the purpose of my trip wasn't to sleep!"
30,The initial room price looked too good to be true. After all is said and done the resort fees cost more than the room and they calculate taxes after tacking those on. Speaking of Resort fees all you get is free local and 800 calls and access to the gym. Seriously who doesn't own a cell phone nowadays and who comes to Las Vegas to work out. Then add on parking fees which is overpriced and you'll find that your stay is a lot more expensive than you would have planned
10,Don't stay at the Luxor!!! Bad service - so much smoke in the Casino!!! Asked for upgrade to be with friends - did not get upgrade that we were charged for. Asked to get different pillows and they replied all the pillows are the same!!!
10,"We first had issues with the check in process where they couldn't find our reservation. They made an ""exception"" and gave us a room anyway. The hotel is decrepit. Elevators that make you question your safety switches falling off walls dirty floors/carpet that will make you not want to take off your shoes in your room... you name it from a hotels worst list you can experience it here. We requested to switch hotels after we were thoroughly disgusted with our room when they informed us we would still be on the hook for the full price (minus resort fees). This one should be torn down and redone."
40,The Luxor is BEAUTIFUL! I loved everything about my stay escort for the sewage smell on the 15th floor and the trash patrons would leave on the elevators. Aside from that the Luxor was nothing short of a pleasurable experience.
20,No refrigerator no minibar no water no coffee maker in the room. Miles to walk to get morning coffee. $35 + tax daily resort fee but only amenity was the pool. Housekeepers were friendly. Mexican restaurant was good.
10,In the past I’ve stayed@theLuxor. I really liked this hotel. But in my opinion the place has dilapidated and gotten pretty awful The remoteness keys DO NOT WORK IN THE ELEVATORS  We HAD NO WATER COMING UP TO OUR SUITE!!!! Just SPURTS OF COLD WATER in shower and sinks!
10,Had issues at the hotel and the staff did not seem to care or want to listen. Also how the heck does it cost 26 bucks to valet park when the room rate started at a dollar more. I feel as if this trip was a total loss. Will not stay here or possibly s mgm associated property again.
50,I loved the structure of the hotel i regretted not staying at that hotel for the 6 days I was in Las Vegas but I will definitely keep this hotel as my go too home away from home and probably extend my stay to 1 week as a family get away .
50,I really like the luxor I always stay here and most likely I will be staying here for the upcoming years. Most of the families who travel to vegas with kids usually stay at circus circus because of the areas they have for kids and the prices but honestly you do not need to go all the way to the back of the strip to enjoy a family stay anymore because luxor is at a much better location price difference is not that much especially since luxor is million times better of a hotel than circus circus and to top that off with the HyperxEsports Arena! your kids will not miss the other place at all!
30,Was given the runaround with oversized parking but security was able to get us parked after our 6 hour trip. Bathroom was disgusting with hair in the tub and rhe sink plugged. Redeeming factor was the view of the airport for my son. Front desk was amazing to put us in a higher floor!
50,After an absence of several years my wife and I returned to Vegas to celebrate her milestone birthday. We really enjoyed our corner King Suite and spectacular view from the 26th floor overlooking the Strip.  The staff was very responsive to our requests in making this a very pleasant and comfortable stay.
40,This hotel had interesting miniature replicas of Egyptian landmarks. During our stay in Las Vegas we walked from Mandalay Bay Resort to Luxor Hotel & Casino through the inside passageway. When we entered Luxor’s main hall we ended up in the hotel’s main hall which was like the interior of a pyramid with dark and somber atmosphere. The front desk area was brighter and more pleasant than the main hall area. To reach Luxor Tram Station for the free tram connecting Mandalay Bay Luxor and Excalibur we exited the hotel through its main entrance/exit doors. The tram station was just across the driveways from the main entrance/exit. Luxor Resort’s front area had quite interesting miniature replicas of a pyramid a sphinx and an obelisk. Although Luxor Resort did not seem to be an attractive hotel to stay at it was definitely worth visiting.
40,A complete revamp of this gem could be used. It is so cool with great spaces just getting a little tired. Great location for Allegiant Stadium events. Room was clean and overall service was good. Thy Pyramid lives on!
40,Great hotel and fabulous shows. VIP at AGT Live was incredible!    The hotel is located in the center of it all.    However the hotel needs a better rewards app (it has too many glitches and has to repeatedly refresh) and internet signal on elevators.    The MLife rewards membership card on the app is NOT accepted by many places to eat and shop at the Luxor. We were told we'd have to charge everything to our room to get the rewards points instead of them typing in our card number. The card needs a QR code or barcode to end this problem.
50,the pool/ Jacuzzi. There is a nice heated pool but they closed it ( seasonal closing).The deal was reasonableand I will go back with a pleasure. The free tram station located at the hotel makes your move easier.
10,no coffee maker or frig in room. yogurt place closed early room was freezing no heater. while at the pyramid cafe ( expensive) my wife needed to use the restroom at 9am they were cleaning it so she had to walk across the casino to another restroom she uses a cane because of a bad hip. why in the hell don't they clean them at 4 or 5 am when no one is around. we used to stay here all the time it was never great but now it sucks. we will be staying at Southpoint from now on. no way to adjust the pressure on the shower head and the shower fills up with water.
10,To sum it up: Cold shower dirty room upon arrival (food particles on floor from previous guests—also trash that was left behind behind chair) AND ROACHES found in bathroom. We stayed here due to proximity to the stadium. Funny thing- we requested no room service but they showed up each day. The housekeeper walked in while I was getting out of the cold shower at 9am. Never again. Haven’t started a complaint yet because I doubt they will do anything and we have only one night left in this hell hole.
40,I like the Luxor and I love the Egyptian Theme and the hotel is very close to everything. After a long plane ride from the east it takes a few quick minutes by cab or Uber to the hotel. I like to stay in the pyramid as you can take the inclinator verese and elevator. My room was renovated and was nice. The pool is very nice. Good value for the money.
20,This is the first time I've been back to vegas in over 29 years and it's not the fun place that it was. The prices are to high it is definently not for family's with young children the smell of marijuana is everywhere (including the casinos) and the elevators in Luxor are a nightmare (very hard to work).
50,The Luxor is in a great location has plenty of dining options and good entertainment choices as well. The casino offers a good selection of table games and a nice sportsbook. It is easy to walk to other casinos and there are some nice shops on the walkway to Mandalay Bay. Self-parking is convenient.
50,I can’t imagine a better hotel experience than what we experienced at the Luxor. We were treated to a free upgrade on the room. The service was exceptional from the front desk check in through to the check out. I would highly recommend this hotel.
30,Our room was very dirty  so was the elevator and floors !! Pretty gross. For an upscale place we were surprised at the sub par soaps and how dirty everything was. We realize how many people were there but the same spill was in front of our elevator on the 12 floor through our entire stay
40,Rooms are a little shabby and the hotel is showing some age. Could use a little sprucing up but the cuts to the service staff is problematic. The front desk is woefully understaffed. You should NEVER Have to wait on hold to call 0 to front desk for your room. You should NEVER have to wait more than 5 minutes in line to check in. That’s just my opinion. Luxor thinks 20+ minutes is okay. I don’t.
50,When I first checked in there was a phone charger on the bathroom counter. When I came back in room later that day it was gone . I checked an all my stuff was there. But it rubbed me the wrong way. I didn't say anything but that made me feel uneasy. Knowing that I didn't move it
50,We enjoy both the strip and off- strip activities. Luxors location makes it easy to get to where we want without fighting a whole lot of traffic on Las Vegas Boulevard. Tower premium rooms are spacious and we love the extra sink away from the bathroom. Only negatives are a bit of airport noise if facing east or helicopter noise if facing west. Either way it’s not horrible but noticeable.
10,The room was dirty sheets felt disgusting carpet felt disgusting shower head was dirty the corners of the floor in the bathroom was dirty. Shower door was dirty. I had two rooms one was newly renovated and other was not the front desk fail to mention that.
20,Guess Service needs improvement!! It will be nice if they have someone taking there time to inform guest when important issues take place during our stay. We where in bed when room service open the door with out knocking first
30,stayed there for 3 nights to attend a wake and funeral. Room was fine but the hallway and casino areas smell is unpleasant. Probably because of the old carpets. Our guest notices too so instead the book a room at Mandalay Hotel which make me agree that they have a better Hotel to stay with.
30,Nothing special about the Luxor. I stayed because it was a quick trip and the room was cheap. I guess it is as the saying goes you get what you pay for. It was my first time staying at the Luxor and I’m guessing it was a much better hotel when it first opened.
40,Luxor is a great place to visit the staff members made my 1st time in Las Vegas a time to remember. The rooms could be updated but other than that the views of the hotel was beautiful and I took lots of pictures to share with family and friends.
40,The hotel is really nice super clean and the service is exceptional. We had one problem with hot water but it was resolved. The location along the strip is not the best because it is on the southern-most end and so it takes a really long time to walk to the other places. Also the food choices within the hotel were not that great either we had to go to the other hotels for more variety and better quality food. The AC was kind of weird. We would set it to a certain temperature but it would never reach that temperature and would always reset itself to lower ones. Overall it was still a really good stay. Parking was easy cheap and convenient.
40,Overall this hotel is a great place to stay. I do not like the $35/night resort fees. Now the resort fee doesn't include parking at this hotel. You now have to pay another $15/night for parking. The pool was closed. What are the resort fees for then?    We stayed there two nights. Check in took 50 minutes on a Monday! After checking in we went out to truck to get our stuff to take to room. Upon walking up to the truck we noticed that our bicycles were gone! Someone had cut the cable lock on back of vehicle and stole them while we were checking in! We parked in bottom level of garage. It was well lit and a security camera not far away and  bikes were locked up. So we thought everything was safe. Wrong! We saw a security guard ride by on a bike and stopped him to report this incident. We filled out the reports and they took pictures and told us we have to call the police to report it.    While in the casino an hour later we told the cocktail waitress what had happened. A few minutes later head of security came and introduced himself to us and asked about our incident. We told him we didn't feel comfortable leaving vehicle in garage and he told us to move it to a secure location that is watched 24/7 for our two night stay. We did do and was very relieved! This guy was extremely friendly and apologetic and seemed genuinely concerned!    After getting a call back from the police the next day and filling out more reports. It turns out that many of the security cameras in the parking garage are either not working or the image quality is so extremely poor. The police got the footage from the camera and looked at it for that hour time window. The image was so bad they couldn't make anything out. This camera would have shown exactly who did this crime had it been working properly. I think the hotel needs to make sure ALL security cameras in the parking garage need to be in working order! To charge $15/night to park and not have properly working cameras is terrible!    This incident did put a damper on the rest of the stay. But rest of stay was excellent. Both rooms were clean. Staff were very friendly. Diablos in hotel was a great place to eat. The total price is a good deal for middle of the week. Resort and parking fees and taxes more than doubled the advertised rate. I think hotels should not be allowed to do this!    It's also a great location right on the strip. I would stay here again. Next time I have bikes I will just use the concierge parking and have then store them in secure area. I was not aware they could do that.
50,What and AH-MAZING Trip this was for my Grands. So Many FIRSTS! First Long Distance Trip as Men First Stay on the Strip as Men First not Staying at Grands. WE THANK ALL WE ENCOUNTERED. OUTSTANDING!!
40,The fact that this place is built as a pyramid makes it a lot of fun to stay there. The rooms are different the elevators are different the design of the entire place is a great experience that even if you don't stay there you should stop by when you are in Vegas.
50,Safe and clean and we enjoyed the America’s Got Talent Show. will recommend Luxor for their safe and comfort ability of guest. We will return again to stay at Luxor Casino Hotel. Staff are very friendly and housekeeping provided all what we need. We are all satisfied during our stay.
30,On 3 of the 4 days I could not park at the Luxor becouse the lot was full. I had to park at the Mandalay Bay and walk over. That:s a long walk when you are draging a suitcase. For 2 days the shower had no hot water.
10,After the fire alarm went off in the middle of the night and the bathtub overflowed in the room above us we struggled to get any money back from the hotel. Our view was on the first floor parking garage so it wasn't the romantic getaway we hoped for.
30,Overall we had a wonderful time in Las Vegas we have stayed at the Luxor before and we were expecting at least the same experience. While some things were very good (service and casino floor) other things were not. A sink that wouldn’t drain no hot water for a shower and just general upkeep could have been better. Also paying for parking now and a resort fee along with the base rate of the room should provide us with basic need items like hot water. We will likely be selecting different accommodations for our next trip.
10,Completely insane thought I got my room for a decent price when I booked months in advance at $70 per night came to $160 after taxes then saw the $79 resort fee. I knew the resort fee was in every Vegas hotel and was to be expected but here’s what completely floored me paying almost $100 for parking for 2 days!!! Historically speaking resort fees include parking nope not anymore! They mentioned an EV charger which is a main reason for my booking there nope no EV charger. When I finally asked someone they told me only vallet had an EV charger so then I went to vallet paid $30 for it and he told me after I got in that they only had two chargers and they charged at 5 miles per hour- seriously!!! Every time you exit the parking structure it’s $15. My best advice take an Uber but even they are charging an arm and a leg. Then come the mask mandates which are not a big deal- whatever but you have employees who aren’t wearing their mask properly (over their nose) and rude to those who haven’t put their mask right back up after drinking smoking or eating… it’s insane!
10,I was locked out of my room because I had my service dog with me. Then I was asked to pay an additional dog fee in order to get back in my room or to get my dogs or else I was going to be escorted off the property by security like I had done something terrible. A total nightmare and embarrassment. Hotel staff did a poor job to listen what I had to say and even a poorer job handling a very normal situation. You don't treat hotel guests like this - very sad!
50,Best deal you can get for the price.  The ancient egypt decorations and living in a pyramid is an experience.  The room was good. Staff was helpful and friendly. Its close to the where all the action is on the strip. Definetely would come back.
50,Everything was great location staff but the only thing was that the bathroom in my room was a bit dirty toilet had a ring around it I bought a scrubber and cleaned it and there was hair all over the shower and floor and sink area but I used my Clorox wipes and a towel and cleaned it my self as I do to everywhere I go to because of COVID
10,I stayed in a suite and it was one of the most poorly maintained rooms I’ve ever stayed in. They have plugs taped to strip outlets because they wouldn’t stay in otherwise. My charger wouldn’t stay plugged in because the outlets were so worn out. Pieces are broken off the furniture in plain view.
10,Old hotel on the strip needs to be remodeled badly. They shouldn't have rented those old rooms in the pyramid. Things broken and missing or didn't work at all. First night no heat and it blew cold air all night. Had to move to tower room (which is still old) to get a better room.
50,Staff was amazing and the food was great. Looking forward to a nother stay. Rooms were very clean as always. I will be staying there everutime I go to Vegas. I give this place a 5 star rating for their cleanliness and friendly staff
50,No issues checking in or checking out. Staying in the pyramid was fun like always. I would recommend bringing friends and family to join in the fun of being right in the beginning of the strip. 💯🙂👍🏼
20,We booked multiple rooms for a family trip - a total of 4. Several still seemed to be in need of rehab. (Staples and poly in the walls - assume this was leftover from trying to keep dust down.) A large suite that was to be used for family gatherings was in pretty poor shape. Missing artwork not enough furniture or lighting for the larger space. (Smaller rooms had MORE furniture - and we had to end up using 1 of those smaller rooms to meet.) parking lot was a challenge. Readers didn't work half the time - there were several events while we were there and when that happened there would be a line of 20 cars waiting to get out.
50,This was a great stay. We have been to Vegas so many times and Luxor checked off another resort there. The hotel is really cool to stay in with the pyramid style and theme. I absolutely love the pools here. It is such a beautiful area for pools!!
50,I had an excellent experience at the Luxor I love the Egyptian theme staff was very helpful and kind all the spaces were clean and pleasant. All for a great price I will come back to this place and experience it all over again.
50,We had a great stay at the Luxor. They have top notch entertainment and excellent dining within walking distance. The great thing about the Luxor is the internal walkways to Mandalay and Excalibur. Then from Excalibur it's just a raised walkway over the strip to New York New York. So you have the convenience of four casinos and all the dining and entertainment in close proximity. We had a great time.
40,The overall stay was great but the hotel could use a little updating. We were in one of the towers. The beds and pillows were not as comfortable as before. I felt the bathroom and shower were not as clean as could be and one day we received no clean towels.
40,The experience was very Las Vegas. The building is huge and lots of things to see. Easy to get lost but you soon figure out which Starbucks is near your room and your favorite tables. Masks were required 11/21. It is unfortunate that people still smoke at the tables(good masks help). BJ Dealers were personable and made the experience fun.
50,Awesome Room. Everyone was kind and knowledgeable.  The Casino was very clean and handicap friendly.  The Security staff helped me to my room and put me in touch with the Bell Staff to rent a scooter.  All of my request were met.
10,Hotel is outdated not many food options.Room was not cleaned properly blood on my sheetsodd odor in roomdust on ventsand dirty glasses.Does not feel like a quality stay at all.Needs to be seriously renovated.Pool is also only open on weekends certain hours.
50,I was able to bring my family along for the 3 day stay at the Luxor. It was the best time we ever had in Vegas. Our delegates dinner at the hotel was very nice and elegant  the food was delicious. The service was excellent. I can’t wait to come back and visit Mandalay Bay Hotel soon
50,Fast friendly service! Gorgeous hotel! They were very accommodating & let us check in early. They even made it easy to pick up keys & sent us a text message when the rooms were done. I loved this hotel!!
50,The luxor is absolutely beautiful. Plenty of shows in hotel. We went to the America's Got Talent Live show. It was a awesome experience. Plenty of food in food court and restaurant. The pyramid room was clean and spacious.
50,Overall convenient to other places and very good and affordable prices to play or gambling....etc  The food was ok and I’m talking about the buffet the rest of the restaurants were good.... and the service for the Hotel was professional.
50,We stayed at the Luxor for our first trip to Vegas. For a middle aged person I found using their app for check in and check out quite easy. We even used the digital key without any problems. We paid for early check in and our room was ready at 7:30AM local time. Never once did we need to go to the front desk. The Starbucks was convenient but usually quite busy. Lots of walking of course. Room was nice and clean and the shower ws amazing. Housekeeping staff was very eager to please. Thanks for a great time!
50,Newly renovated rooms at selected Luxor floors. Staywell rooms added advantage. Just need humidifier added too in the future.  Buffet is ok. Better to choose different restaurant.    Food court was good. .
50,Rooms Great for the money Hotel has great proximity to the stadium and has great food options. Great customer service the women who checked us in was very helpful and patient with all my questions. Only thing I can complain about is what every Nevadan complains about Paying for parking. Overall amazing day amazing stay.
50,The premium King room was an experience i enjoyed the soaking tub in the room couldn't find a hotel with the jets so i settled for the tub i had an ok view still worth the trip and room i would stay again at the Luxor for my next trip
50,Luxor was amazing! The location was a good location and walking distance from the strip. The staff was accommodating and prompt when needed. My boyfriend enjoyed his first trip to Vegas. Jason and Jared at the front desk was AMAZING! Will indeed visit again
20,I thought the rooms would be as Impressive as the hotel itself I couldn’t have been more wrong. It’s an old hotel and you can tell. It’s underwhelming the rooms don’t look nice (there is no mini fridge which sucked for drinks). We got “upgraded” for 20$ a night and this was just another room not in the main pyramid building and in a tower. Nothing special it’s cheap and you’ll know it. Good location so if you don’t care where you sleep go for it! It’s got the titanic exhibit and it’s connected to the Excalibur.
30,We were assigned the wrong type of room at check-in. It took four phone attempts to reach someone to get this straightened out. We arrived to our room and it was ok but could have used a better cleaning. I was also disappointed to see that the pyramid has turned into a big billboard and the sphinx was wearing a Raiders eye patch. It was much nicer the last time we visited and stayed here to be able to just see the big pyramid and not an ad.
10,We stayed in the pyramid Premier room that is newly remodeled. It is still so outdated it's not even funny. I will never stay in this hotel again. There's no maid service so when you need clean towels or toilet paper you got to find a maid and ask her for some. If you want an extra hour on your check out time at $40 and if you want an extra 2 hours $60. We usually stay off strip and where we usually stay the room way nicer then here at the Luxor. I will never stay there again.
10,Principal reason is guest room cleaningshower so dirtytowels with other people haircarpet so so dirtyuncomfortable bed to sleep wellthey need to improve cleaning because I got a terrible experience on my stay..sorry
10,Not really vI understand if doing upgrades to your rooms but did you have to doing at 12 am? Also hasn't very useful that there wasn't automated kiosk that would of helped expedite then check process.
30,The shower kept flooding toilet kept not flushing the toilet back is killing me from the bed feeling like some kind of dorm room futon And kept getting redirected all over the place for one simple fix for the rewards program. The one great thing about the Luxor is carrot top
10,The Luxor appears run down. It used to be one of my favorite places to gamble and now I down feel safe there. A lot of sketchy people walking around and asking people weird questions. The rooms are not cleaned very well & quite frankly it’s falling apart.
10,The hotel had no hot water for the first two days. Then no water at all another day. Hotel staff was rude and caught them yelling at customers on numerous occasions. Elevators were in dire need of maintenance. No mini fridge and no microwave in rooms. Terrible stay.
10,Do not book any accommodations at the Luxor - Smokey poor service and dirty!  Could have written my name on the end table (dust) - no blanket …. Ordered one which took over an hour and I called twice!!
50,This was our first stay. Stayed for 5 nights in a recently renovated Pyramid Premier King Room. We were impressed. Room was clean through out spacious and surprisingly considering we were on the 12th floor it was quiet. Housekeeping staff was friendly & attentive to making our stay a comfortable one. Ate at the Pyramid cafe where staff was friendly meals satisfying. Used the self parking in upper & covered lots which was easily accessible.
50,One of the least expensive places to stay on the strip. Room was updated from when I last went in 2019. A friend stayed at a nearby hotel across the street and told us that our Luxor room 2 queen bed room is bigger than theirs. The Luxor is clean and very accessible. The mobile check-in/out and add ons on the mobile app is amazing. Made our stay so great we didn't even have to go to the lobby to check in just went straight to our room. Luxor is so fun and I will definitely stay here again:)
30,It was our first trip as husband and wife together as a couple with our kids grown and didn’t tag along the noise that can be heard from other rooms and hallway noise including dogs barking is bad rooms are dated and needs a face lift
50,Very clean and affordable. beautiful building. The Public House has amazing food and the slots pay! The elevators in the pyramid are cool and the rooms are slanted. The tower rooms are cool too. Staff was great! Only place I stay.
50,Great property but if you are older you need to stay closer to the center of the strip as it for is more convenince to everything. Hotel service and staff was great and would rate them a 10. Will go back to Las Vegas enjoyed it.
40,I really like this hotel it was clean the lady who cleaned the room was very polite we arrived on Monday not many people but on Thursday thanksgiving it was crowd we had problems to get an uber excellent weather. I saw dogs everywhere I would prefer not allowed dogs.
20,The hotel is located in a very convenient location but other than the location the rest are really not good. Stayed 3 nights and 2 nights there are alarm went off at 5 AM in the morning and took more than 10 mins to get it cleared and couldn’t fall back sleep anymore. check in line is too long and waited more than half hour to finally get checked in Same for check out. one night there is a stranger/homeless trying to open my room door which is very scary as I lived at the end of the hall way in a floor. The room doesn’t have a microwave nor a coffee maker nor a mini fridge. Finally the soap bar provided in the bathroom is really bad quality and both my friend and I had irritated skin after using the soap.
30,The Luxor is worth a look. Initially when I walked in I was in awe of how massive the structure was and the Egyptian theme. The only downside (if any) is that the hotel is a tad bit dated compared to a few of the newer ones. Overall it was a nice experience! I love the Grand entrance with the oversized screens and the great acoustic sounds as you enter…. Very classy!
10,This was one of the worst experiences at a hotel I’ve ever had. My boyfriend and I came for our anniversary this past week and when we arrived after traveling for 12 hours the room was not cleaned at all. There was cigarettes weed and trash all over the room. We went back down to the front desk and the guy kinda acted like it wasn’t a big deal and changed our room. He did take off 40$ for the resort fee for that one night but I still feel like that didn’t make up for the dirty room. Our next room was also dirty not as bad but still wasn’t clean. There was stained towels used soap and hair on the toilet seat. When we brought this up they said there was nothing they could do. I took pictures of both rooms. What really made me upset is Friday morning my boyfriend had gone down to get water from the lobby after telling him he couldn’t charge it to the room because he didn’t have his ID because he forgot it upstairs (which he was totally fine with he said he’d go get it) they had a security guard start harassing him as if he was doing something wrong acting like he was a criminal. I was in the shower and got a knock on the door the security guard had his hand on his hip like he was going to shoot/tase one of us. It was absolutely insane. I called down after and the manager said we can just leave if we want. I have never in my life wrote a review but after how they treated my boyfriend I will make sure to tell everyone never to stay at any MGM which is a shame because we actually travel quite a lot.
10,First room was dirty and smelled the second room the beds were broken housekeeping left trash in the hall that smelled the floor the restaurant service was bad waitress was rude they didn’t mention the pool or spa and everything closed by 9 p
20,Every time we parked at the hotel was a parking fee even thought we were guest who stayed there it’s seems like they value the casino players more then the guest who stayed there. There were a couple of time were parking could not be found so 20 minutes of driving in a timed parking lot was our usual. We would stay out as much as possible just to pay for one parking ticket.
50,Satisfied with the stay the guest services/check in desk is quite busy but there were staff who were able to help to skip the line. Just a little problem with other hotel guests slamming their doors seems rooms are not quite sound proofed. But all in all our stay was excellent.
30,The only problem was there was no hot water and I never got my security deposit back but overall a good experience and my boyfriend and I had a lovely time walking around the casino and enjoying the way other looked on the inside
50,This was my 3rd time staying at Luxor and the quality is consistent. Our room was updated and very clean. The front desk person who checked us in was very nice as well! Enough gaming to meet our needs and then some!
20,Very basic rooms. Building alarm sounded twice during my stay. Once at 5:07 AM our first morning. The second was on our last morning again at 5:07 AM. A $35.00 per day resort fee for things we don't use. Our room was only cleaned once on our three night stay.
50,Great economically friendly and nice refurbishe pyramid rooms. Staff is great very down to Earth. A very different experience. Not too glitzy and not too pricey. Also not as crowded because it’s at the end of the strip.
10,Stayed here several times but the cleaning has deteriorated. Our room had carpet stains elevators were nasty dirty and the halls never were cleaned the week we were there. A kiss imprint on the elevator door was there all week even though they advertise additional cleaning due to COVID.
50,First I was a winner! Luxor was the first Casino I ever won big. The bed was comfy and the felt good. I usually prefer tubs but the high pressure shower head felt so relaxing. Buffet was great! Staff was helpful and friendly.
40,Typically we have not had good luck at the card tables at the Luxor however this visit the dealers and pit bosses were amazing! Very friendly attentive and excellent customer service. It was Melinda Harris Angel Johnson and Norma Porter at table games. Thank you for being great!
10,The hotel is dated big time while the rest is as expensive as any of the big hotels on the strip. They ended up charging me for the 'smoking penalty' and I definitely wasn't. I bet it's just because the rooms are from the 90's and still smell that way.
30,Average hotel on the strip with limited amenities. No closet space. Outdated furnishings. Remodel room but feels outdated with old carpeting and water damaged door. Room was cleaned daily however refilling of towels and soaps were lacking thereof.
10,Awful hotel. Very outdated. Televisions in room were the worst quality. Room was old - furniture in room was from the 80’s. Please take your business somewhere else. I would never stay here again. Being honest.
40,We had a great time. Some of the staff at the casino floor are rude but overall a really good time. Baby was happy so mamma was happy too. Restaurants were decent and my husband I did have a good time playing. Some of the waitresses are nice and some just seem like they hate working here.
10,Remodeled rooms yet use the cheapest toilets! these baby size toilets are awful and also no shower door meant the floor got wet easily and I hurt myself slipping on the wet floor I didn’t break a leg or anything like that but it did cost me discomfort for the rest of my trip needless to say I’ll never be returning to this hotel/casino again
50,Great hotel. I loved how I was able to be accommodated with a better view of the complimentary rooms. Slept great and had lots s of fun at the casino. Very impressed at the architecture of the whole building. I would definitely be returning for a longer stay.
10,The whole room was on a slant. No hot water 1/2 of our stay and 4 hours of no water at all. Toilet paper 3 arm lengths away from toilet. Refrigerator not secure in slot. Waited 30 minutes for keys after check in. Elevator was just wood panels. Keys don’t work in car park. Advertising jetted tub but no jets.
10,Please don’t wear your white shoes to Lexor; their floor will turn your shoe from white to black(full of dirt). The towers east and west are the dirties. There are only few differences between a before and after room cleaning: new towels some facial tissues and new hand soap! Other than that the rooms are always filled up with dirt’s sense.  Front desk hotel registration are terrible and rude. We are here to enjoy our family vacation but they treated us like we needed homeless shelter.
40,Overall the hotel is a great place. My daughter celebrated her 21st birthday there and love it. The only proble was the parking. It took us 2 hours to find a parking space. Will see you next time.....
10,Hotel felt dated and dirty. Shower had mold bed was dirty and the bedsheets felt like newspaper. This whole hotel just felt cheap which maybe is the vibe? I don’t but for me It would be worth spending more money for somewhere nicer.
40,Check in was breeze for us. We didn’t like our first room they had no problem moving us. The location is great the finding are ok we usually stay at mgm but this place was much more value than the mgm Las Vegas. I like both but I wish I would have opted for an upgrade while I had the chance to be more centrally located. I was in the west tower and it was not that bad at all.
10,Alarm every 2 days 3 alarms total for our trip at 3am and 4am and made everyone in my room have panic attacks and anxiety. Ruined our days because we were off schedule and lack of sleep. 😪 Then 2 nights there were Raiders fans fighting and arguing in our hall way Loudly. Accidently went up in elevator looking for our room and it swayed and didnt seem right everyone in elevator was freaking out. Underage teenagers hanging out near where i was gambling in the middle not playing slots and being obnoxious talking about there fake id's screaming in ear shot. Restaurants in hotel were over priced as well as drinks. Aggressive fans around hotel not being monitored provoking others after games in the casino. Not being able to use pool on weekday and having to walk to another hotel to use pool. Not being asked how we are doing or how is our say. Housekeeping banging on the door after we had just fallen asleep from alarm that went off to clean. There seemed to be a number of things that went wrong in our 7 day vacation.
20,The front desk gave my party rooms far away from each other. All of us had no water or no hot water on one or two of the nights. My party was unhappy with the dirty carpet dirty sheets and uncomfortable beds
50,We enjoy staying at the Luxor every time we do! Good location fair price and nice place to eat play have fun and rest! I like that the tram is available to take you to neighbor hotels to enjoy even more places without making your feet ache!
20,Not very clean smelled of pot including the room. Breakfast buffett is expensive but food choices were poor and limited. Location is good considering there is a tram to Excalibur. Absolutely not what it used to be.
40,Overall was a great place. We just didn’t like the fact that there was no refrigerator or microwave in the room. Beds were worn and too firm for us. There is plenty to do and the Blue Man group was the best part of the stay
10,No priority parking for hotel guests spent over an hour looking for parking after a long day on the strip. Got to the room to shower in scalding hot water and hard water pressure. Notified front desk and we layer found out they had been having issues all weekend on our floor. Were told we'd get a new room and that never happened. Walls are thin and room smell like cigarettes. We will never stay here again
20,Yellow stains on bedding and bed had definitely seen better days likely in the 90’s when it was built. Service and buffet left much to be desired. The AGT show was amazing and so was the front desk staff
50,Great location the tower at the Luxor has large rooms very comfortable beds and very clean sheets and towels. 2 Starbucks and also great restaurants. Also The Blue Man group show was amazing. It never disappoints me.
30,My time in Vegas was good but when i got to my room I could not sleep I could hear everything my neighbor was doing. Very unpleasant. After paying for a suite upgrade i felt i was going to get a good room to rest after a busy vacation but that was not the case.
40,I enjoyed my stay!! My family wanted a quick getaway from the holidays and Vegas and the Luxor was exactly what we needed!!! It was total fun doe the entire family! The titanic was amazing to walk thru! I can’t wait to return!!
20,From paying over $500 for our stay i definitely wasn’t pleased with it at all. From hardly sleeping cause the toilet would keep running 24/7 very loudly and then also having the staff tell me they wernt gonna fix my issue and instead just give me $25 off voucher to dinner. Which was nice but definitely didn’t fix my issue or meet my needs
20,I booked a room and was encouraged to use the MGM M-Life app for checking in Room Key etc. I put my boyfriend on our room online & in the app and it was never updated in the Luxor system and they would not let him in our room when he lost his phone and I was sleeping resulting in him having to book another room for an outrageous cost of $300 - so much for using my rewards for a trip and free rooms. The lady I spoke to the next morning even told me the app sucks and we should still check in at the desk. When I added him to my room through her - the app updated and said that I had (2) guests with my boyfriends name both times - how did it not show that he was booked in our room in their system in the first place when he had a digital key and was listed in the app.
40,Hotel could add USB ports in there rooms for charging of electronics and provide guest with a map of the hotel along with the amenities offered. Hotel is on the strip but not the real busy part. Bathrooms could be upgraded.
20,Our clothes were taken from the room. Not sure if they confused our clothes with trash or if it was stolen. I called front desk they didn’t know what to do and then she transferred me to housekeeping and they were also confused so they transfer me to security. Security did a good job but still waiting to hear back from management
10,There is no parking available in this resort. Both lots were completely full and they charge to park your vehicle with no guarantee spots. They should have included parking in the resort fee which was already expensive in additional to the room.
20,The hotel had a lingering sewage smell during our five day stay. We chose late checkout on the app and were charged but had to go to the front desk to get it added to our reservation notes. The staff at their Starbucks were rude. The water pressure and temperature were horrendous. Don’t waste your money here.
10,There was vomit by the elevators and the room was not as nice as the pictures. The parking was also terrible. They started closing the lower parking when it wasn’t even full which resulted in everyone cramming to the roof.
50,This hotel was very nice lots of restaurants and shops within the hotel walking distance to a lot of tourist attractions. There is also a Tram available to make getting around quicker. Hotel has a real chill relaxed vibe. A food court is also within and a few restaurants. Only downside was there was no refrigerator or microwave in our room and we brought tons of food prior to checking in that expired because we had no where to store it. Do not go to the 24/7 convenient store/shop near the front desk in the lobby...they have not prices on any items in there. My wife an i purchased a small lemonade a small bottle ginger ale a pack of twizzlers a bag of popcorn and chocolate covered pretzels that came out to $32 and some change...that's outrageous we would have been better off just going to the food court to satisfy our munchies. They had no prices and did not even offer to tell you just ring everything up and then look nervous to tell you the total. overall...very good trip and would definitely stay again.
30,My husband and I wanted to get away for Valentine's so we went to Las Vegas. We stayed at the Luxor. We have dietary restrictions so I asked for a room with a refrigerator. I was charged $25 a day. They brought a dorm room 4x4 refrigerator and put it on the floor instead of moving my room. If you book with a 3 rd party such as TripAdvisor or booking.com you will get a room way far back in the tower. My window was dark the only view was the pyramid and I couldn't tell if the sun was out or not. The room was dark even with the lights on. The dark atmosphere made me feel dark not cheery and happy. I contemplated losing money and changing hotels. The beds are very low and uncomfortable. The highlight was ordering breakfast in the pyramid cafe. The service food taste and food presentation were excellent.
10,Wornout smoke filled $$$ overpriced for what's offered. They charge you resort fee when pools were not open...crazy. why should I pay when half of the amenities were closed. They sent us to Mandalay bay pool and that was not heated and jacuzzi was colder than the pool... There all pools were not open either. Was awful.
50,Melinda Harris was friendly helpful and knowledgeable at the three hand poker table.  I believe she is the supervisor.  Melinda has excellent rapport with her employees I noticed.  She made us feel very welcome!
10,Booked pyramid room months in advance then got “upgraded “ to west tower. App digital key doesn’t work got stuck in the elevator. A security guy gave me grief about the way was wearing mask even though it was covering my nose and mouth and he wasn’t even wearing one! Just a really poor experience. I recommend you stay as far away from this resort as possible. Unfortunately there are probably five thousand suckers behind me waiting to get screwed themselves.
10,Rooms A/C Heater  Casino Services  And Atention in cleaning staff I found to many Areas dirty Including Carpets bathroom Rooms Windows living room armchairs they have spots and in all areas everything I touched gave me electroshocks
50,Clean room good service the hotel is in good place the decorations is very nice every year I go with my family to Las Vegas and all the time I stay in the Luxor hotel I love the hotel is good to stay ❤️
10,If you have a personal car dont even think about staying here. Parking is terrible. I needed to look for parking spot over 2 hours every night. I needed to park at other hotels parking with their advices even I was paid for parking
30,It will be awesome if I could win at least one time you would think if a person comes there as much as I come and travel as far as I travel you can win something I mean I literally wins nothing but yet I keep coming back but I don't know about coming back again because like I said I've been doing it too long not to be satisfied not even breaking even I just don't understand that
30,Horrible beds and staff would not acknowledge any issues we were having. The box office was helpful and the bartender was amazing. Friendly and experienced. The cafe was great a little pricey for what you get but it’s Vegas.
30,Beds Ned more comfort towers need a fridge carpets need to be more clean the AC. Need adjustable vents other than that everything els was great showers were big beds were big bathrooms were clean staff was good
30,It’s an average stay need more work on cleaning the rooms right overall it’s a nice hotel to stay in by the strip and affordable .Would recommend if your on a budget but other than that it’s a good stay .
40,The room itself was nice and clean. There was construction going on 3 doors down and sounded like a drill would pop thru the wall at any moment. We were on vacation for a week and it’s not what we wanted to hear in the early morning.
10,Room sucked. Elevators sucked. Lines were too long for check in. Check in sucked. Key cards suck. Digital key cards suck. Parking sucks. Thermostat sucked. I want a refund. Waste of my time and money.
40,We were in town for the Raiders game vs. Bengals hotel was very convenient. We loved the tailgate party pre game. Staff was very accommodating. Check in / check out was very easy. It was our first trip to Las Vegas but will definitely be back.
20,I had a great experience in my Las Vegas trip overall but the Luxor hotel was a disappointment. Room were outdated even thought I paid extra for a tower room. Room tiles were stained and made them look dirty. Room had a door to join to next room but that made it that you could hear the next room neighbors easily kind of uncomfortable to sleep. The parking garage for the Luxor is small I had to park next door at the Excalibur couple of times due to insufficient space.  Overall I would not recommend this hotel something more centered in the strip would be better for sure.
10,Unless you are on a budget don’t stay here! Room heaters weren’t working water wasn’t working unless you enjoy cold showers. Carpet floor was wet in several parts of the room called room service they told me to call back the next day
10,Mask and cups behind the dresser/tv. I thought they would at least provide mini fridge or coffee maker. I would not recommend to anyone. Not a good place to gamble. Slot machine were tight. Did not win anything
10,Very old hotel even their newly remodeled rooms are smell. I do not recommend staying there. They couldn’t even change a room for us because we stayed in one of the nicest rooms lol. It was so bad that we even stayed only for one night instead of four.
50,We went to Vegas to have fun play poker & eat great food. The Luxor was perfect for this. We were near our favorite restaurant and when we wanted to explore the Strip the taxi line moved fast! We would definitely stay here again.
20,Parking: 2 nights we couldn't park in the structure because it was full - had to park at Mandalay Bay - I'm a guest and I can't park at my hotel?    Parking part 2: I have Pearl status and for some reason the card didn't work for parking most times I tried to use it. This was not limited to Luxor. I think the system was having issues but it was annoying. Had to contact security multiple times to get in or out of the parking garages. Never had issues like this in past but this time it just added to the frustration of this trip.    Elevators to the rooms seemed like they need some love. The card access didn't seem to work correctly (no light up beeps confirmation that it's working) call buttons and floor buttons didn't light up or were very dim - couldn't tell what was going on.    Digital key on phone didn't work for us. This wasn't a big deal because we got cards made but annoying.    Prices for simple things like a bottle of soda is crazy. Almost 6 dollars for a bottle of soda. I walked down the road a little bit and got 4 of them for $6. The nickel and diming needs to stop.    Machines didn't seem to pay. There were 4 of us in our party (they stayed in a different room) and nobody really hit anything worth while on the slots. We had much better luck at other casinos (Non-MGM resorts).
40,We’ll stay again next time I am in Vegas. Rooms are nice and quiet. Customer service was great food was good. Parking is a little hard to find when the show are on . The Monroe service is great to get close to walking distance to the T-Mobile arena.
30,Hotel showing its age but still a good value. Staff friendly. Cafe served frozen waffles. Disappointing. Valet Front Desk and housekeeping staff all pleasant and helpful. Disappointed lobby bar closed for most of stay. Would have been nice to relax and listen to the piano
50,My stay at Luxor was very pleasant and problem-free. The room was clean spacious and comfortable. I liked that there were several bars (such as the Centra) and eateries (such as Diablo's Cantina) accessable - I could get a drink without leaving the hotel! The pyramid structure made it interesting and unique and I love the Batsignal-esque Sky Beam at night! I really enjoyed the Buffet at Luxor which had good selections (salads breakfast fare desserts Chinese and Hispanic foods etc.) for the $35 price.
10,This place shouldn't have a place anywhere we changed rooms 4 times due to many issues. Heater didn't work saw a roach unsafe location in the hotel fire alarm kept going off party place loud noises all night expensive self parking. It's a nightmare. A motel 6 would service better. MGM should be ashamed. This is insane and they know this exists look at the other reviews. The rooms in the pyramid have an oder and the carpet in the rooms need to be replaced from the dirt and stains. Housekeeping said they didn't have disinfectant spray. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY do the math and stay at another hotel.
10,No where on the website does it mention $150.00 security deposit. $450.00 For three room this took away from our family vacation. I would have been prepared if i was told about the deposit.    My parking pass did not work after three attempts with the front desk. (Other was backed up beep horns) Did work at the other MGM Property until i was giving a additional card only for parking. Really felt like i was been punish for coming to the MGM Luxor.    Signed embarrassed guess.    My room was dirty cold & with out hot water. Maintenance and (David the Manager) was in our room two of the three night. What happen to the MGM LUXOR?    My wife my mom three kids and I are all disappointed
50,I had the best time like always. Our to go place when we travel with the whole family. Not expensive clean and fast service. Spacious rooms. Check in was fast. Was not busy so that was a plus kids love the elevator ride. Lol
30,If you want a budgetary location this is fine though I am sure there are better places. Service was ok except for Debbie at the VIP counter who argued with us and other staff. There was also difficulty parking in the evening as spaces filled up and no spaces for guests of the hotel. Rooms are fine and clean but out of date. Stay Well rooms are kind of a joke as there isn't really anything unique about them compared to regular rooms.
10,Was charged for $190 for the video I watched which I thought was a complimentary. This was more than the room I paid for which was $80 room. The manager didn’t help me solve this issue which left me very unsatisfied.
40,If you have any knee problems or leg pain. Ask for room near the elevator. Only one elevator entrance per floor. For such a big hotel. It would be nicer to have more elevators. But everything was good.
40,Friendly staff quiet room  comfy bed great time playing slots! Thanksgiving dinner was amazing candied yams were like homemade by my Granny! No wait to buffet and worth every penny! Mlife staff Myrna huge help and friendly
50,Fantastic family vacation. The Luxor has held up well considering it’s age. We will definitely be back next year. Spacious updated rooms. Tranquil vibes. Great dinner experience at Diablo Cantina. Easy to navigate hotel and casino grounds.
40,My overall experience was great. I had no problems. Customer service was very helpful and friendly. The cocktail waitress came by on a regular basis. The floor hosts was very friendly and didn’t hesitate to help.
50,Great room for the money! Friendly staff beautiful architecture! Very close to the strip and shopping centers! Yummy restaurants in the food court and do not forget to check out the titanic exhibit very interesting!
20,I was not impressed with The Buffet some of the food was OK and the desserts were pretty good. I enjoyed the shops and a couple of the restaurants I went to were pretty ok. I liked that it connected with Mandalay Bay and Excalibur that was cool. The spa in Mandalay Bay was wonderful! Over all it was ok.
20,My first night there it took 2 1/2 hours to send someone up with blankets because we had no hot water or heat in that room. I finally got into a new room around 2am with my baby who was exhausted. 2nd night in the new room tv went out. No refrigerator in the rooms.
10,It too expensive for the poor quality.    First of all the shower door doesn't fully close and the water gets out making a puddle. Therefore making it a safety concern. We used 2 of our towels on the floor to keep ourselves safe.I had never been in a hotel with poor quality like this. Parking lot is stressful and a nightmare. The offer you can park in other hotel such as Mandalay and Excalibur but they not offer a shuttle services and nobody in the reception area mention it. In conclusion I did not recommend it. You can find better options
10,Upon checking out I was erroneously charged a smoking fee of $500 to my debit card I used to check in. I had a set budget to gamble with and that money was in my bank card account. After calling thet told me the charge would be removed immediately. 3 days later its finally returned the day Im leaving Las Vegas. I was flat out lied to by the Luxor rep on the phone. When we arrived we found multiple items from previous guests including bottle caps receipts and wrappers. The room was only half cleaned at best as these items were basically out in the open. Luxor completely ruined my vacation and I doubt I will ever stay there again let alone other Mlife properties.
20,The room we stayed was facing the loading zone so super noisy the first 3 nights bathroom fan and suit living room heater never worked mattress was curved in the middle and super uncomfortable….etc…..
10,The shower door doesn't fully close and the water gets out making a puddle. Therefore making it a safety concern. We used 2 of our towels on the floor to keep ourselves safe. Plus there was a hair that wasn't ours in the glass. My hair is much longer and my son's hair color is now red so we knew it wasn't ours. The beds are great.
50,Very convenient to get to Allegiant stadium and around the strip. convenient shopping and restaurants within walking distance. Did not like having to deal with the key for the elevator but overall enjoyed my stay and the convenience for Raiders game day
40,I wanted to add an extra guest on the room to allow my friend to go into the room and decorate before my boyfriend and I arrived but hotel reception was not accommodating...also I paid for parking upon check in and my key never worked to get in/out parking garage the entire stay....so I had to call each time we were coming in/out....holding up the line....but outside of that I enjoyed my stay
20,The room was relative inexpensive but had a lot of issues: stuffy smell terrible views slow-draining sink bathroom floor would get soaked with every shower (no shower door) no USB charging outlets and spotty wifi.
30,The hotel is located in a great location but it need an update and fix up right away. When we got their the first room they give us smelled like cigars inside and this hotel is a smoke free hotel room. Than the towels were dirty. We asked for our room to be switched. They give us another room that was connecting but the only way to open the connecting door was by pulling the door extremely hard for it to open because if not it was stuck. Than the rug was dirty. This is not my first time traveling to Vegas. But I can truly say this hotel is one of the worst. Staff member were great very sweet and nice.
20,Don’t go to hotel with family (young ones) during Raider game days unless you want your kids to see tough guys inhale 2nd hand marijuana and good with no one wearing a mask (except staff). Felt like my family was hot boxing while in our 2 rooms. Pretty sure my 9 year old was high due the entire floor smelling like fresh marijuana smoke from guy passed out in hallway and several party rooms. Yes she got munchies around midnight.
10,I didn’t expect the top notch quality and service. Only basics would have sufficed. I’ve never stayed in a room with such a poor condition from any hotel motel or inn. The air heater didn’t work to put out warm air. There was no fridge or coffee maker. The shower was running cold water in the second morning.
30,Arrived at hotel and had a suite reserved. 4th time staying at Luxor. We get to our room and have to pull the bed out to plug in phones etc. Behind the bed was absolutely filthy. Cigarette butts wrappers and C02 cartridge. I decide to pull couch away from wall. Again cigarette butts and wrappers. Went to front desk. Spoke with manager who moved us to a different room. Original room on 20th floor of main hotel. New room in west tower floor 11. Was much nicer and updated. Down side people on the floor we’re definitely smoking marijuana which made our room smell like it also. Told lady at front desk and she said she’d make a note. No other comps given for smell. Kinda disappointed with this stay. Next trip gonna try different hotel.
30,The first room was like a throw away; not clean things broken okay view of the empty pool and parking lots. The design was okay but not as functional as it should be in the bathroom. House keeping was very kind but overworked. Nothing really looked crisp and clean.
10,Found strand of hair on supposedly clean towel. Only one shampoo and one body lotion provided for a 2 queen bed hotel room. Found jeans sizing sticker on side of wall next to toilet. Moldy black specks coming out of cracks in shower. Previous guest's togo menu found behind hotel room door on floor when we first entered the room. Room is not soundproof at all. We were able to hear someone snoring and coughing.
40,Great place to stay. Decent location. Needs updated. It’s kind of old. When gambling slots they didn’t really bring you drinks or check on you unless at the tables. Room was decent. They did accommodate our needs for the rooms to be next to each other when we weren’t.
20,No fridge and microwave in the room have to ask for it and it is considered an amenity. Lack of fridge and microwave is to encourage buying food and drink from store.Made a reservation for a king for the whole week only to find out they gave out the room when we went to check in. Had to be put in a queen for a night. Got it resolved the next day but had to go to reception twice in order to correct the issue.
10,Don’t stay here The room was filthy the panel in the elevator was shaking open and loose I reported it three times in an hour five days it was never fixed staff did not wear their masks throughout the Hotel and even when you checked in There was a maintenance issue the lights were hanging down with exposed wires
20,I didn't want to believe the bad reviews but I sure should have! This is the worst MGM affiliate I've stayed in. My room wasn't ready when I arrived even though I checked in with the mobile app 3 days before I arrived. The water was shut off for several hours two nights in a row. I was woken up early in the morning on my second day by hammering drilling and banging because they were remodeling the room above me. They changed my room so I had to pack everything up and move to the other side of the hotel. The sink in my new room was clogged and they didn't fix it until the next day. The new room was smaller and not as nice. The spout on the bath tub was broken rusty and jagged as was the shower. And the room wouldn't stay cool (even with the AC on 65 the whole week). The front desk was quick to comp the resort fees as if they're used to having to do it all the time. They shouldn't even allow resort fees anymore it's not like you actually get anything special for $39 a day! RIPOFF!
10,I had no water for 2 nights. The front desk did not help me and I had to wait till the next morning to receive water to shower. The carpets were dirty and the entire hotel smelled like a cigarette mixed with a strong old lady’s perfume. Very disappointed.
40,Location was great for the Tournament at the Ultra Arena. Too bad the South exit is blocked. There were virtually no wait staff offering beverages on the casino floor. The bell staff is not 24 hours. There are no HA rooms in the Pyramid only in the towers. Fire alarms were obnoxious 2 mornings at 5am. Rooms were clean and comfortable.
10,Been to Vegas 10 times since Covid reopening and each trip has been worse. Vegas post Covid is not worth visiting in my opinion. Prices are outrageous and service is non existent. True story “guy in front of us ordered a drink (cost around $35 bucks) waitress gave him the wrong drink and basically told him to take it or leave it”. Machines are at tightest hold % and table mins were 25-50.    Went to see AGT Las Vegas (show was great) but Luxor is a dump! Pool (only 1 small pool) was opened & not heated zero service unclean chairs and walkways. Room was basically falling apart. Bed is very small curtains broken bathroom shower pressure causes water to flood the bathroom walkways are all broken and even broken glass just lying on the floor elevators (covered in construction material) were malfunctioning and going up to 20th floor then going down fast to 1st if you could get the few with working key card readers. I asked for 1 thing before our 400 dollar dinner and 500 dollar show - 4 towels so we could shower. The maid told me no so I called! They brought 3 towels after several hours - so the primary guest had no towel after he showered. Towels are kinda basic items. This trip was so bad I don’t think we’ll be going back to Vegas anytime soon.
10,There was so much wrong I don’t even know how much worked. From elevators not working to my shower door only being half there. It was truly a horrible stay. The bathroom wasn’t cleaned when I arrived nor did turn down service ever come once.
30,This was my first introduction to vegas. I guess maybe I got my hopes up too high but the hotel overall feels like everyone is disconnected. As someone who works in hospitality I guess I felt there should have been more of a genuine service like an actual resort. For the price it wasn't too bad but I think that next time ill stay elsewhere and see if I can get more of a Vegas style experience. I also mistakenly left something behind which I realized hours after checking out and already in another state and the only help I seemed to get was to call a number which nobody answered and fill out a form. Ive accepted the fact that these were definitely found but I won't get them back. Oh well.
20,There is plenty of parking for hotel guests if you don’t mind parking at the other hotels next to Luxor. I came back from a friends place at midnight to no open spots on self parking and the valet was full. When I complained to the front desk there response is nothing we can do it happens. Maybe here but it’s never happened at any other hotel I stayed at in my entire life. Stuff like this ruins the vegas experience/ vacation for me    PS. Cleaning staff security and other staff other than front desk are friendly and nice. Room was fine and pretty clean
50,I really enjoyed my stay. I stayed at the Luxor to be close to the Raider Stadium but after all the excellent service and treatment I will definitely be back to stay again. My cousin accompanied me up to my room so I could change and she was very impressed with my room and said she will stay at the Luxor when she returns also. Very happy with my stay. Thank you!!
30,I was not happy with my stay my air wasn’t working properly the shower only had one shower door and caused my bathroom to become super wet and cause me to fall. No fridge and no microwave. My room was free but I would’ve paid money to be cool and not hot. My room smelled like mildew! I told the worker at the front desk and she didn’t seem concerned about anything I was telling her.
20,Sent to dirty room. Tried to call front desk and left on hold for 30 min. Shower chair coming off wall. Husband got stuck in elevator twice and staff seemed annoyed when we informed them. Would not recommend for price.
30,The beds were hard. I had paid for the pyramid but was in the tower. I would come back if we had incentives for gambling. I was disappointed with the traffic because of the fight. It was very hard to finally get into the parking garage and I didnt like having to pay $15/day for parking since I already had a room
50,The Luxor has and will always continue to be one of my favorite spots to stay at in Las Vegas. I almost don't want to tell you about all the good things because I want to keep it to myself. Lets just say you won't be disappointed with the value and quality of your stay. Close enough to the Entertainment of The Park and far enough away from the congestion of center strip allowing for easy in and out when it comes to personal car travel.
20,You pay resort fees without resort services! No refrigerator safe or microwave in the rooms. No running water on my last night there. We were unable to shower or use the bathroom before checking out!
20,We found roaches in our room. Seems like a regular issues as they mentioned there was a policy that we had to follow. Quit concerning. Staff seemed more concerned with other guests not finding out more than anything.
50,My husband and I stayed at the West Tower. Check-in was quick and easy. Staff was friendly and quick to accommodate if possible. Initially I was worried that our room was going to be old looking since Luxor is one of the older casinos/hotels in Vegas. But we were pleasantly surprised to see that our room was clean and smelled clean. Decor and furniture looked nice and was way better than our stay previously in Bellagio where one of the sinks looked uncleaned desk was dusty and a random “do not Touch Bar” sign was on the edge of the bath tub. Both times we stayed for free using our reward from the myVEGAS slot apps. If I were to pay for my hotel room during my next stay in Vegas I would definitely stay at Luxor hotel. Great value for the price of the hotel room.
10,Get what you pay for. Completely on the opposite side of the strip anyone would want to be on! Prepare for a walk of your life!! Staff was rude. Bedding was horrible; the worst pillows in any hotel I’ve ever been in
20,I lived in Las Vegas from 2000 to 2002 and the Luxor was my favorite hotel when I was not in Summerlin. Now it seems to be a shell of the old pyramid and looking forward to being demolished for something more in vogue.
50,Booked a room for my son and his girlfriend for a few nights stay.. I didn't have any issues at all with the front desk when I had questions and who I spoke to was very nice and even let me know what shows would be going on that week. My son enjoyed the stay and experience for his first time.
50,We arrived early Friday and knew that we would be unable to check in but were amazed by the service of the front desk representative to help us with an early check-in as well as the super quick response from the Bell Desk. We received our luggage 10 minutes after we called. Very impressive!
50,Had a wonderful experience at the Luxor had been recommended by family and did not disappoint. Staff was very friendly on check in and room were great. Will be staying at Luxor when I visit again in February. ☺️☺️☺️☺️
10,Was charged hidden fees at check in. There was misleading prices. For the price I expected more. No refrigerator s or microwaves in room. No coffee pot in room. Super eight has coffee in your room for way less price.
20,The water from the sink shower toilet and bath were not working for a long period of time at some point. Was essentially left with going all the way downstairs to use the restroom. WILD. This is part of the basics for a room. I still love MGM hotels but will not be returning Luxor.
30,There's nothing wrong with the place but it's nothing special. The rooms are sparse and dated the casino itself is meh and compared to other LV hotels it's definitely low-rent. Maybe that's a plus for some folks but to me kind of defeats the purpose of going to Vegas for something special.
20,There was no shower door at all..! Just a piece of glass covering a portion of shower... Bed was comfortable though  Water was not hot and had to call maintenance to get it looked at and working we were not comped for inconvenience either
40,The Vibe in the Casino was great! Dealers are friendly and staff were working their hardest! Short staffed like every Hotel Not Named the Bellagio. Stayed in a 1 Bedroom suite that was not very clean and VERY dated but bed was comfy and slept very well
30,Overall decent experience that staff at the vip lounge could have been more accommodating when we checked in it took over a hr for us too get our room because supposedly it was still biwng cleaned also got charged on ky credit bro
20,Found a bug in our bed the first night. We were in the east tower which everyone said was the “nicer” part. They switched us rooms but still freaked me out. I didn’t sleep well that night at all. We checked out the next day. It was nice of them to switch us and the second room was much cleaner but still. Otherwise the main areas were nice.
40,Very nice experience overall the check in process could be much quicker tho. Being that it's at one of the ends of the strip it does mean you're probably in for more of a walk than if your hotel is more centrally located but that wasn't too much of an issue since there was a tram and other means to navigate around. The staff was very friendly and I felt very safe even with COVID-19 still being an unfortunate reality. I felt it was a very good deal for the price. The drink prices at Flight bar were some of the cheapest prices we saw on the strip and I enjoyed the deli that was open overnight. I would certainly consider staying at the Luxor next time im in Vegas.
10,I got completely scammed by one of the bartenders who works at the Flight bar. So if your playing even when sitting at the bar I found out they are supposed to comp your drinks. Well the first full day I was there the bartender let me  Pay for the fist drink while ai was  Playing Video Poker set a glass in front of me kept taking my cash for the six dollar beers I was ordering. I was there for a good while and I had preserved a few drinks and I thought he was just letting me run up a bill so I went to pay for the drinks and he said just leave it on the bar and I will get to it implying that he would come around and cash me out for the drinks  because I seaid to him that I would like to settle up he let me pay for the drinks and then I tipped him on top of that. Not realizing he was just pocketing the money the whole time. I didn’t realize what he had done until I sat down at the same bar the next day with a different bartender who was honest and let me know the drinks were computed because I was playing just like I was playing the day before. I thought to myself before I even got there “ yeah you probably need to maybe watch out  For the other casino guests because you will always have at least a few that are hustlers. I totally dropped my guard while sitting at the bar because I never thought someone who works for the Casino your paying for would scam mebut boy was wrong because he got me for about $50 in drinks that should have been comped plus I tipped the guy real well. Thought I was getting a pretty good deal only paying only paying $6.00 a beer when if you buy a bottle from the bar it’s $9.50 until I met the honest bartender then next day who informed me that just like the casino floor if you are playing at the bar your drinks are  Comped . Damn that first bartender totally scammed me which in turn made the rest of my stay there really bad because I kept on thinking the staff were going to continue to try and scam the stupid tourist l”me” out  Of as much money as they could.
20,We arrived Sunday to find a zoo of people who had been at the Raider game and parked at the Luxor making our life hell to find parking for ourselves who were actually staying at the hotel. As we settled down into our room we turned ON the TV and noticed that it was cracked and unwatchable. I had to call front desk and they made me go down stairs to get new keys for a different room. There is a major disregard by guests to follow hotel rules.. like the smell and smoking of marijuana which was going into our bathroom vent making it very uncomfortable to sleep. We also witnessed other people sneaking in their dogs to the rooms and we could hear them barking. Bathrooms have missing caulking and mold on the corners of the showers. I don't think I will ever stay here again or recommend this casino to anyone.
30,I had to request a room change before I felt I was in a prison cell when I entered the room that was assigned to me. Other than that the personnel was kind and quick to solve the issue.  I doubt the bedroom sheets were clean when I arrived as they had some stains. They changed them when I called housekeeping.
50,Customer service was great and staff was professional. Room was clean however there was only one trash can in the entire room which was located in the bathroom. Overall our entire stay was amazing. And parking was free for the guest. That was awesome. Next time I'm definitely planning for the spa.
40,Parking is very mediocre. That being said the check in/out process is very easy the room was surprisingly nice/clean and the casino was good fun. Ate at tender and the waitstaff there was absolutely incredible as was the food.
30,The rates were good. However the room was not special not even really clean until the staff cleaned it after our first night there. No coffeemaker no refrig takes 15-25 min to go down wait in line to buy coffee and get back to room. Checkin/checkout and digital key with app was handy but the only way I recd a receipt was to go wait in line. No way to retrieve it on the app or online though they said it should have automatically been emailed to me. Building was extremely cold for me. This was late November and I needed my coat indoors though only needed it at night outdoors...
30,Security will not move the homeless/meth heads or enforce the no-smoking areas. Machines stay broke. Could be a great old property but MGM does not put any money into it. Dogs piss and poop in elevators
30,we were bambuzzelled into the ole upgrade package. average no frills casino hotel. had to move from first room due to pot smell and sticky floors. second room had black mold in the shower and fire alarm at 5:30 AM.
10,Management snooty and rude was told to come back to discuss issues later. Furniture and air conditioning outdated and not working properly. Elevators slow and only half of them working. Rooms smell of marijuana.
40,Awesome pre-game set up for An amazing experience. Great food and drinks! Clean casino with good eating establishments conveniently in the heart of all the action. Elevators were slow and had to wait in line after the game to get to my room but an overall great experience!
10,Front desk staffs are very unfriendly. Problem with the room wasn't taking care. Offer pity solution without apologizing. Bad customer service ever. MGM should retrain staffs regarding basic engagement with the customers
10,The hotel service and quality has significantly decreased in recent years. The price increased from table minimums when wanting to play 2 hands at the blackjack tables. The sink and shower were clogged in our room and everything was dark and dingy. Limited dining options then mass craziness due to crowds from LV Raiders home game. Very disappointing visit for an MLife Member.
40,Convenient for our stay. The room was clean check in was fast and easy. Jared at the front desk was very kind and professional. The only set back of the room was that the water in the shower did not drain.
30,This was a very interesting experience. There are lots of great sights located in the hotel the waitress serving during gambling could be a little more people friendly. Really enjoyed visiting the Big Chill when Mike was on duty. Very pleasant and out going personality.
30,We stayed close to an elevator and it made noise all day and night. There was no hot water to take a shower in the morning. The staff was very helpful so I feel like they deserve at least three stars.
20,My first suite at the Luxor was dirty. I was able to get a second one it was better but not great. The west tower smelled. Just not impressed. Will not stay there again. Customer service at the front lobby was great!
40,Where do I begin? This was a one year anniversary gift to us from my mother and the newly remodeled Luxor was the perfect choice! The food at the Backstage Deli was delicious! The bathrooms were spacious and the beds felt like muffins! Being on the east side of the hotel put us in great proximity of EVERYTHING! We will be back!
50,Our stay at the Luxor was pretty great ! The hotel wasn’t as far from the middle of the strip as I thought. My digital key using the app gave me a few issues but it was probably due to the lack of service in that area. The rooms were nice and comfy I just wish the beds had a thicker cover. I will definitely be visiting again!
30,"The hotel is a good/far walk from the rest of the ""action on the strip"" it is VERY dark and gloomy inside needs to be updated. The rooms were nice but they need a face lift. Constant noise from the airport might keep you awake at night so bring ear plugs! The TV has no guide to tell you whats on or what station your watching. Pay a little more and stay in an upgraded hotel"
40,Stayed for 5 nights on a recent trip. Room was clean and spacious. Some water damage to the lower bottom of the bathroom door probably due to over spray from the shower. Good water pressure but there's only one glass panel in the shower and water sprayed out the back onto the floor. Requested that housekeeping come less often (don't mind reusing towels) and was told they had to come every third day which was fine. They never wound up coming the entire stay. Got a call from security on our final day stating that our do not disturb sign was out the whole time we were there which was untrue. We did place it out our final day in the afternoon after being gone all day to nap. I think they got our room confused with another. We wound up taking our trash out and placing it in the cans in the hallway a few times. Otherwise the stay was good.
20,Clogged shower drain took 15 minutes just to get into my room due to slow elevators overhead bed lights buzzed all night long I could hear the plumbing from other guests. Valet was non existent as well.
20,You pay for the hotel and the resort fee (40$ per night) and now you have to pay 15$ per night to park there the heater didn't work in the room there was a wet spot on the carpet by the bathroom the digital keycard didn't work on the elevator
30,When I dropped my car off for the valet my bicycle derailed was snapped and I was confused about how the valet worked since it was my first time. I believe the room I was assigned was a smoking room and I don’t smoke so that was unfortunate. Some of the elevators where under construction but we’re still operational. I won’t be staying here again especially for the price I paid. The check in staff were nice the valet experience was not great again especially for the price. I got there at 10:30pm and left by 5:30 am. it’s kind of wild how I got such a bad impression from a short amount of time spent there not sleeping. Roughly 2 hours awake and I didn’t enjoy it.
50,I chose this hotel because of the value I got. It's right on the strip very close to the places I would like to visit. Great experience checking in and checking out. The room was immaculately cleaned every day by the friendly staff. I could not be happier.
10,No refrigerator or microwave in the room. Shower had not curtain only a half door and floor was wet after every shower. Felt like I was staying in the projects after visiting nearby resorts. Decor in room looks dated.
10,This hotel should be rated 3 stars. Old appearance. Some facilities did not work. Fast food stores closed early. Not enough attention from the staff. They were trying to charge for the regular type action movies. The room was clean but no comfortable.
10,This hotel is the most run down hotel of the top stay hotels. The rooms are warn out millwork is water tanager furniture is in poor condition and room not well appointed. The location is not comfortably accessible to the main strip and the layout of Towers and pyramids is confusing. Tram was also out of service for a few days and elevators are filthy.
30,This place is a good place to stay if you're attending a Raiders game. It's only a 10 min walk from the hotel to Allegiant Stadium. Also the beer garden has good food and drinks.    Here are a few items that I had issues with:    1. The digital key on my mobile app would not work in the elevators. I had to go back to the front desk and request a traditional key card so that I could get to my room.    2. Housekeeping forgot to turn-down my room on the second day so I had to call and request a cleaning.    3. After the football game it took me an hour just to get back to my room because the line for the elevators stretched out to the front desk area.    4. The shower in my bathroom didn't have a shower door (by design) so every time I took a shower the bathroom floor got soaking wet.    5. There are not enough parking spaces in the self-parking lot.    6. It took me about 20 minutes to exit the parking lot as there is only one exit.
30,Do not visit when a football game is on that day as it is impossible driving in or out. Room didnt have lotion heater didnt warm room. Tv was old and picture quality was like 480p. This casino now feels like a casino from down town vegas.
20,Had a couple rooms reserved. One was dirty and beds not made. No refrigerators in room. Only two pillows. We expected more but it is what it is. Elevators take forever to get from rooms to lobby. I will not be staying here next visit to Las Vegas.
30,Place is nice and a 20 min walk from the strip but becareful of check in fees when planning they arent included in online purchase and was around 200 soo theres that but casino is cool and food is great
20,We had a king suite but there was no microwave in the room. Only 1 of the 2 ac/heater units in the suite worked. The hotel has mobile room keys but they only work if you have internet access. You need your key for the elevator but there is no wifi or cell service at the elevator so you really need a standard hotel key.
50,I stayed 3 nights at the Luxor and had a wonderful experience not only is the Luxor casino large ample space is provided to everybody I did not feel like a sardine like I did it Paris. I bring up Paris because I interrupted my stay at Luxor because I always wanted to stay at the Paris hotel and I have instantly regretted it (here now!).    I should have gone and spent all my time at the Luxor lol! Having the experience at staying at a hotel like Paris where it's super crowded and you feel like a sardine in all the common areas and then the check in process was horrible they don't have any real digital checking process made me a 100% realize that I will come and stay at Luxor any time!! I always thought the Luxor was a bottom of the barrel hotel and I was wrong I was completely wrong lol!    MGM's digital check in process is wonderful I did not stand in line In addition to that their military veterans program is superb I really appreciate not having to pay for self parking.    The room was spacious and the things that I didn't like were that the beds were low and there was no fridge or microwave. That said we stayed in the towers and it was newer and updated enough. And there was a bath tub that was amazing.    Pena at front desk helped with getting my military info together and info I needed so that I could enjoy their Military / Veterans program.  Jennifer at Pyramid Cafe was the best server.    Overall wonderful experience
40,My husband and I stayed at the Luxor for 2 nights and we loved it! Our room was large and accommodating for our small dog. the only problem was there were no fridge or microwave in the room so we could t take leftovers back to the room. We were on the second floor which was very easy to locate and the shower was nice. Lots yo do and see in the casino and conveniently located on the strip. Payed parking was good and it could be used at any mgm owned casinos near by! I would definitely recommend it here!
50,The checkin via the app was painless and came real handy. Had many flight delays and this allowed a digital key so we could go straight to the room no long line! Room and everything was clean. Every staff member we encountered was nice and friendly and helpful. It really made our time enjoyable. Check out was easy as well using the kiosk. We will definately be going there again!
30,Didn't recommended the hotel and stay away from the spa very expensive and personal unfriendly. the person who do my massage was very unprofessional and I can paid the same amount or less for better massage in New York.
50,First off I'm an M Life member which added to the convenience of this trip. I flew in on 11/2/21 for a meeting and to see Santana next door at the Mandalay Bay on 11/3/21. The minute I stepped off the plane I got an email telling me that my room was ready. Once I walked in the front door of the hotel I bypassed the check-in line and used the digital key that I was provided through the M Life app. I was in my room in minutes. The room was clean comfortable and well furnished. I have read reviews of the M Life Desk staff and was a little apprehensive about visiting the desk for a new card and some information. I can tell you that the staff at the M Life Desk were a tremendous help and they provided top-notch customer service. I can say the same for the staff in the restaurants food court retail outlets and the front desk at check-out. I'm already booked at the Mirage for my December trip but I plan to stay at the Luxor when I return again in 2022. If you want an affordable stay in Las Vegas seriously consider the Luxor. Also consider becoming an M Life member to make your stay even more convenient and enjoyable. Plus...Carrot Top is celebrating his 16th year at the Luxor and you certainly don't want to miss his show.
40,Our room in the West Tower was nicer than expected. It looked recently renovated. Large room and large bathroom (big shower and separate soaking tub). The price was great for our 3-night stay. I would stay again.
50,Everything was clean and easy to navigate. Friendly staff great views. We have been staying at the Luxor on every trip for the last few years and we have never had an issue. If something small comes up they correct it immediately and then you are onto the next thing.
40,My stay at the Luxor was cool. I enjoyed the food at the sports bar and food court. I love the variety of things to eat and do at this hotel it was actually very busy during the weekend I went but I enjoyed my stay. The rooms are spacious and remodeled.
30,A decent hotel to stay but lacks cleanliness. Hallways are dirty. Lightly dimmed can be a pro and con. Staff that did help were often dismissive. Slots 2/5 times were dirty with left behind drinks and picked up very slow.
50,Was very satisfied with my stay. But they really need to update the rooms asap and put locks on the door and a fridge in the room. Location is nice tour groups either picked me up from the hotel or just one hotel down.
10,Room was not as advertised. Terrible and tiny. Low quality bed. So low you will have trouble getting out of it. Towels were hard. Shower in room of low quality. No water or other amenities in the room. Awful view but was promised a street side view.
10,Backed up sewer water when I took a shower and the lady had the nerve to say she can send someone to fix it. Fix what? It smelled like sewer in my room! Disgusting and unacceptable. Changed my room at least they did that much. Will never be staying at LUXOR again. She didn’t even want to help me. Didn’t even want to hear me out.
40,Thursday night check-in is a breeze  Good:  usb light tub clean good water pressure two Starbucks (west tower & east tower) pre-order Starbucks and pick-up downstairs (they are CRAZY busy) plenty of bars people are very nice. Public house food and service was good.  Bad:  a little dated but not bad - some peeling wallpaper in hallways TINY pool area (jacuzzi is 10x10 locked out of room at 10am when going to get coffee no live music (lounge at Excalibur or Rhythm and riffs Mandalay)
50,Lots of fun. Lots of laughs. Room was exceptional. Good memories.. Great perks.. can’t wait to return. Many casinos within walking distance and a variety of restaurants to choose from. Walking distance
40,Great hotel clean. Affordable good customer service would definitely recommend this hotel to others. Location is key right on the strip and close to shopping good dining everything is within walking distance.
20,I went here for my birthday week. They don’t have refrigerators or microwaves in the room. However to get them you have to pay 60 more dollars per night on top of my 400 just to get it not worth it. U have to pay for parking and unless u park across the street at Tropicana which is free. Honestly you might as well go to a Hilton Marriott holiday inn something else!
10,Was given a different room type than what I booked was told my reserved room was no longer available and would have to take whatever they had available that day. No heater they said they do not have heaters. Shower fan broken.
40,I enjoyed the hotel but the smell it has is a bit overbearing . Restaurant food was not that good and overpriced. Disappointed room did not have a fridge or microwave. But the room was clean and comfy. The staff was very friendly and accommodating.
50,The rooms are clean it's close to where I'm working I have not ever had a problem with parking the staff is politethe one thing that would be nice is to see them open some more restaurants the food court is well a food court
30,This used to be one of my favorites hotel in Vegas .Staff very friendly and helpful . Great restaurants and shows and location great for all nearby casino . I had a big letdown on my suite furniture old and showed signs of aging and need to be replaced.
10,one of the worst trips I've had very expensive very little in way of service didn't get the room i booked all the shops and restaurants close by 9pm. walked in the door with bags in hand got wrangled into a timeshare spiel under the impression of a discount to a show. all they care about there is emptying your wallet
30,We went for a wedding we were so excited but when we got there the room was just average Price was not cost in hotel was high from drinks to food… 3 drinks for 2 was over $100 basic breakfast was $75 or more…
40,Clean rooms plenty of space. Bathroom was clean and nice with a soaker tub and stand alone shower. But food was expensive on the main floor. I strongly suggest if you’re traveling with a family to go upstairs to the food court. Much more reasonable
40,I went to be around the football atmosphere. Had a blast. The hotel was great and the staff was very helpful. It was very affordable and I will definitely stay there again during football season. Fun atmosphere.
40,Stayed at this property for an event at Allegiant Stadium. The location is perfect which is a short walk. The room showed its age but was clean and comfortable. Did not have a refrigerator so that was disappointing.
20,"We checked in at 11pm. Front desk said they needed upgrade our room because our originally requested reservation room was not finished by housekeeping. Front desk in fact down graded our room as there was no kitchenette and had a terrible view. The front desk made it seem as if they ""upgraded"" our room because of the inconvenience. When got to our room it wreaked of cigarette smoke and the front desk told us there was no more availability.. even during the Day N Vegas event going on in town. Not happy whatsoever."
20,I received the room with the dirty floor the bathtub had hair and the bathroom door broken with fungus I have photos of everything I decided to pay more for the bathtub I chose that room and I couldn't use it
20,Rooms are outdated. Showers have a half door and water gets all over the bathroom floor. No USB connections by bed. No Bluetooth speakers in the room. Furniture is old. Bathrooms are very basic. No refrigerator in room.
50,Had a great time at Luxor. Check in was easy and fast. We were able to check in using our phones and didn’t have to deal with standing in the line. Room was great which was located in the East Towers. Would definitely come back.
20,Ok stay especially if you choose to stay for AGT. Didn’t win anything in the casino (lost over $100) yet won at 4 others. Had ice cold water in the sink and shower. Room was good sized. Parking garage was extremely confusing
20,Parking sucks location is off the main part of the strip. Getting to your room is a pain. No microwave fridge coffee maker or shower door. Low quality tv room is always cold. Guest cant visit your room without having you walk them up. Did i mention the garage to park smells like a sewer and PARKING SUCKS!!!!!
10,Hallways in the tower smelled like cigarettes. Had to call twice to ask for my room to get cleaned. House keeping banged on my door early on check out day asking when I'm leaving I had dnd on my door
20,Room was not cleaned once trash remained in the room no fresh towels provided. Beds are very hard. No visitor material provided at all. No information on where a pharmacy could be found or activities provided during the weekend. Not even a Bible what!
50,Overall great experience at the Luxor. Atmosphere of the room was quiet and relaxing which contrasted well to the fun and electric atmosphere of the casino. Food choices was great and decently priced for Vegas.
50,I absolutely love this hotel and casino. The staff is awesome the food and drinks are amazing and the odds of winning just seem a tad bit better. I definitely love this place and I’ll be staying here each time I come.
20,stayed 4 days. room had no peep hole. everyone could just look inside. restroom door had mold. room did not have a fridge. TV would not move. had to sit on the bed or you could not see the screen. the two chairs were very dirty. my first time at Luxor and it was not what I was expecting.
20,The room was so uncomfortable I was awake all night. There was no room service and the only open deli served less than sub par fare. I do not reccomend. Save yourself the headache of finding the right elevator to your room and stay somewhere less complicated and more accommodating.
10,ZERO toilet paper when checked in Pubic hair on the glass in the shower TV didn’t work sticky stuff & glass stains on nightstands and dresser bathroom picture was broken found a sweatshirt by the curtain that was ours. Super gross and no coffee maker or fridge.
30,Nice room. Some damage to furnishings. Refrigerator on top of a cushion instead of a hard table. Not expecting King Suite Corner on 1st floor with no view while sitting in the soaking tub. Check in was rapid via mobile.
50,Traveled to Vegas to partake in a slot tournament. First time ever being invited. Had a complimentary room at the Luxor. Was very impressed. Room was spacious and clean. Bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was nice. Had some great food while there. The tournament was fun even though I did not win anything big. But the slots otherwise we're generous and I went home with more money than I brought.
50,Room was great. Service was great. Went during the week Tues they Sat.  Not too many people therefore we were able to go sightseeing on strip and not too crowded. Oh and we did gamble a bit and still came home ahead. All in all great getaway.
50,Numerous stays at Luxor but this last stay just beat all prior ones. Staff is exceptional Rooms are clean and the dinning and casino experience is perfect. My Host deserves the biggest Thanks for making my stay a great one. Luxor will continue to be my place of choice!!!
30,The room I had was pretty nice as it was recently renovated. However the furniture was not new and I suspect it was hand-me-downs from Bellagio. Also there were some weird flaws. There was a cabinet for a fridge but it was empty. The room was newly remodeled yet all the plugs and light switches looked like they were old and grungy. The shower was the kind without a door just a static single piece of glass. While this isn't that bad the sill plate that it sat on was sloped away from the shower; allowing all the water that hit the glass to run down and out on the bathroom floor. That's a terrible design flaw. All in all I was happy with the room though.
30,The overall price of our stay was great but the room experience not so. The staff is great and very friendly and with a busy resort/casino running all operations in no easy feat. Our room shower was not draining and contents in the plumbing would back up into the pool of water you are standing in as you shower. We requested maintenance and the front desk offered a new room. The staff was great in this process but unfortunately the new room had the same problem. The shower would not drain and water got everywhere in the bathroom. The half-door covering for the shower although aesthetically cool is not functional. Not the best hotel experience but not the worst. Nice for the price and perhaps we were the unlucky ones with the backed up shower plumbing.
50,Friendly and professional staff hotel is very clean they go out of the way to answer your questions and concerns the dinning dining areas are very hospitable and friendly and very clean the slot machines are clean
50,Had a great stay at the Luxor! Room was great the amenities are great and every employee we interacted with was awesome! Getting around to nearby resorts is easy. Saw the Blue Man Group while here a must see!
40,The elevator ride while noted as a feature was disturbing as it shimmied and shook. It required you to place your room key and hold on a pad driving drunken guests crazy. One gentleman got so angry I jump to his aid for fear of being stuck in a confined space with a lunatic. The rooms however were spacious with lots of lighting options and the bathroom afforded ample space for toiletries. The toilet made a loud noise when flushed like an airplane toilet and perplexed me until I realised it needed extra pressure to flush sideways. The buildings within the building had beautiful architecture and worth risking your life for a glimpse which I did at least once. The rest of the time I clung to the wall for fear life as I am afraid of heights. The cutouts made to afford a view gave it the look of a motel looking inside which was discombobulating.
50,I booked my trip for my 40th birthday and I will say I wasn’t disappointed at all. Would absolutely recommend this hotel to everyone! The staff was very friendly and helpful. The rooms were very clean and well maintained.
30,Best part about the Luxor is it is affordable and comes with a combination of rooms. There’s a lot of places to choose from to eat and the sports book is located right next to a bar and eatery. I suggest staying in the towers as these rooms are all upgraded.
30,I paid for early check-in but the room was not ready. I was told that I could upgrade for 100.00 and the room and view was trash. There was a musty smell and the shower floor and bathroom had hair of someone else splattered on the floor as though it wa cleaned up with dirty mop.
50,Great hotel room for the price! We paid under $60 per night for a quiet and clean room. Great strip location and lots to see and do in the area. We did not have any issues and staff was very helpful. Checking in late night did take about an hour so be aware of a possible wait to be checked in upon arrival. Overall it is a quality room that will leave you with plenty of extra money on things to see and do in Vegas!
20,Ourselves and 2 other couples stayed here a few weeks ago from a Thursday - Sunday 3 rooms total and all pretty much had the same conclusion; would not come back.    The good: the gaming area was lively clean with good music playing. Enjoyed the dueling pianos located near the check in lounge during peak check in times.    The bad: ugh where to begin....how about elevators! There are only 4 sets of elevators in the pyramid located in the corners of the building. Depending upon your floor# you are assigned a specific corner of the building where your elevators are located. Stay with me here so you go to your corner which supports your foor range and there are...get this...only 4 stinking elevators to support so many floors and on top of that the room inside the elevators are very small. These get backed up going up to your room or even coming down on average we waited 10 minutes every time we needed an elevator and from about 10am-11;30am forget about it. Even though you might not be checking out there are many people who are and many turn to taking the up elevator just to be able to get on or they never will and elevators then stop at every floor on the way down as tons more people are waiting to get on. Absolutely horrible design for this hotel not sure what they were thinking.    No fridge in your room (see photo): they decided to take these out of your room and instead charge you $25/night to have one brought to you. I've never stayed at hotel where I'm paying over $200/night and it doesn't come with a fridge hell I think Motel 6 even gives you one.    Bathroom (see photo): shower is only covered with a 1/2 wall water spraying all over the floor soaking our floor mat and causing a very dangerous slipping hazard.    Pool was closed the entire time we were there with either ropes or barricades surrounding the area.    Restaurants: the very large pub near the casino was only open 1 day during our entire stay we were there. You had to go to another property to get a meal if you missed the buffet times.
50,Great rooms. The tub is great for soaking. Great price. Great price for over night parking. Buffet was OK but the deli was amazing. Everyone had great customer service. I will be going back and only to Luxor
50,Everything from the start of trip was great. The front desk the room and view. The cleanliness of the rooms the bathroom etc were all fantastic. Then the food (The Buffeet Public House Diablo's Cantina were all great with great staff). The shows were great AGT Live and Fantasy.
50,The staff was amazing. Food was good. The rooms were great. The beds were the best beds I have ever slept in at a hotel. Only thing is there wasn’t a mini fridge or microwave to keep food cold or to heat food up if you brought some back to your room. Also they had collected trash and left it in the hallway by some of the rooms for awhile (atleast 12 hours or more) we checked in at 4pm and it was still there at 9am the next day
20,I would like a do over so I can make different arrangements. With what we dealt with in the elevator to smoke filled air in a smoke free room what can you do? After being told to call back later to voice your issues told me how much they cared.
10,Staff from check in gaming deli food staff Starbucks staff unfriendly unhelpful and seem bothered to help.  Halls filthy gross and sticky. “Renovated” room looks like new bed thrown in and bathroom incomplete.
50,Some rooms however do not have a microwave or fridge which can serve as a mild inconvenience. Pool is great it has a monorail good food great views etc. Staff was professionals and responsive. I would do it again.
10,The Luxor is in serious need of a makeover. The rooms are very tired the paint is peeling the shower glass needs regrouting. The hallways have cracked marble and are stained. The housekeeping will enter your room before you can get to the door to answer it. This will happen before 9am. I don't know if I will ever return.
10,Have stayed at Luxor several times before. But this recent stay will be my last. Self checkin does not work; room requests were totally ignored; bed linen had unknown stains; no housekeeping one day of my stay even though I was out all day and the do not disturb sign was not out; phone system did not work when we tried to call an onsite restirant to make a reservation.
30,The Vegas strip is very dirty now. Used to always seem clean but not anymore. The smell of Marijuana is overwhelming. The performers on the strip used to perform at least for a tip now they just seem to dress up and expect a tip
50,My husband and I went to Luxor to see Americas Got Talent show decided to spend 1 night. Rooms are nice but there was no mini fridge but although there was loud music all night the room was very quiet slept very well. Food choices after the early show were slim ended up at food court three fast food places and a Mexican sports bar were open. Starbucks was still open till 9:00 p.m. Overall a good experience. Largely because we took our own coffeemaker. None in room. Nothing in the room but a hair dryer.
40,Lots of things to do on site. Walking distance to Pinball hall of fame and stadium for sports and concerts. Very comfy bed and pillows.the buffet was great with lots of choices for breakfast. The personal omelet was my favorite.
50,Friendly staff rooms are nice very affordable and walking distance to the action of the strip. It had a lot of dining options all casino options s and a sports book. Also has entertainment. Luxor was great for the price
20,Staff was all wonderful but the hotel is old and far away from the main part of the strip. I wont be staying at the Luxor again although prices are pretty decent so if that’s your aim go for it.  Rooms smelled weird
20,Older room. No clock coffee maker or refrigerator. Shower leaked all over B.R. floor & fan in B.R. didn't work well. No extra door lock on door as per most hotels. Carpet needed shampooing. Also the shampoo & lotion they supplied were very small - no more then 1/2 oz. No Concierge on property.
50,If you come to Vegas you have to stay at the Luxor the staff is amazing and very knowledgeable. I couldn't have had a better stay and will be returning to this establishment on my next stay in Las Vegas.
20,Wasn’t happy with athe unknown room change and flooding sewage systems. I had sewage coming out of toilet and shower drain!!! I wasn’t very happy with the room change because it was the same situation plus I didn’t even get the room I originally booked.
30,Uncomfortable beds. No mini fridge in room after we requested on the 1st of 4 nights. Confusing layout. The map you can download didn't pull up. The map the concierge emailed was to a different building. Long lines ALWAYS at the front desk and bell station. No one was friendly nothing special about to experience. The location is the only positive attribute.
20,"Between the ""borrowed"" blanket that won't be returned and the ceiling leaking makes me question if I should return. I have food allergies and was offered mainly food credits as compensation. I'm upset that the staff didn't pay attention to items in the room and took a blanket that was on the bed cause of it being the same color as the sheets therefore assumed to belong to the hotel."
50,I stayed in the West Towers with out a great view of the strip. The room had been refurbished recently and was nice. It was quite a walk to the room from checkin. Though the Luxor is not in the middle of the strip it provides a good view and has quite a few of it's own amenities.
20,Rooms felt run-down and dated. Fire exit signs hanging from the ceiling by wires. Rides in the elevator had us grabbing on to something to keep our balance. All in all our stay was not what we expected for a high-end suite at the Luxor. on the upside the Diablo restaurant was good and the overall staff was very friendly and helpful.
50,Well i had a blast once i got off the plan i picked up my rental from sixt . Meet up with my pops and we walked the strip because my room wasnt ready . But once i was able to take a shower and eat it was on from there . I had a great stay at your establishment
30,Beware of this place. The room was dirty. Then they charged me $300 for room cleaning days after I left. They claimed I was smoking in the room which I did not. I won’t be staying with any of their properties again.
50,Love the Luxor. The staff were helpful. The food was great. There were lots of games and we actually won some money. We rode the free tram to Excalibur and then walked the Strip. Love the hotel theme. Great trip.
10,Was excited to stay here but room was not good at all. Room was dirty and covered in dust. Bathroom vent was caked in dust. Green stuff on bathroom wall and old shampoo sticker on wall. Very disappointed.
50,Great place to stay close to Vegas strip. Really recommend if you are wanting something close and affordable..also alot of great things to do in the hotel itself close by shopping through the neighboring hotels.
10,Terrible is right. No refrigerator/freezer and no coffee maker. Pillows were flat and uncomfortable. Smelled musty like people had smoked in room before our stay. Pool was closed so had to take a walk to Mandalay Bay to swim.
30,I reserved the king suite. No mini fridge no safe no extra covers. I was very disappointed for being my first time in vegas. I really thing they needs to check all the rooms. I reserved Pyramid king suite. & was not at all up to my satisfaction.
10,We planned this group trip starting last January with special rates. Upon arrival none of the rates had been set up took over an hour to check in and the majority of the staff acted like you were an inconvenience to them. I will never stay at an MGM property again.
30,I liked the architecture and the design of the hotel. I also really liked the very friendly staff. I didn’t like the elevators which were super shady and dangerous or the uneven carpets or the location or the security staff outside or the dirty tub in our room or the robes we asked for that never came.
10,Stayed here and found roaches in the room. We promptly grabbed our belongings and left the location and just went to a different hotel away from there. The casino was nice and atmosphere was good. But Regina will not stay again knowing they have roaches.
20,Main area restrooms need repair and maintenance. Running water was nonexistent late at night. I was there because of the proximity to the Raiders. More information should be provided for folks that are there for the game such as tailgating information.
40,The entire experience at the hotel was good. However the pool experience was not on par. The server didn’t even come to us for the first two hours. The towel service was nonexistent. The WiFi was very slow. Then to top it off they don’t tell you kitchen was closed until you try to order food. The staff that were packed in the towel hut were too busy playing around unprofessionally to notice very much of what was going on. So the inside to the hotel was great. The outside pool area was not worth paying services.
50,Took my wife to Vegas for the first time for her birthday. Stayed at the Luxor hotel and had an amazing time. Staff was friendly and helpful couldn't of asked for better.  Definitely planning our next trip back to Vegas and to the luxor.
40,Your room should be ready by 3 PM check-in and not at 5 PM. We went with another couple on the same floor and they found someone else’s eyelashes on their clean bed as well as all the soap used an out on their sinks and coffee stirrers opened and in the drains. You guys give them their first night free especially after they couldn’t get into the room after 5 PM which was great ! Our room wasn’t ready until well after 3 PM because you had a surge of people show up at the last minute well that’s not fair to those of us who planned far ahead  Once we got into the suite ( the first suite ) we were feeling much better ! I had to call the one 800 number for my friends to complain that their sweet wasn’t ready and we really needed to all change and go to dinner and unpack….    After all was settled and taken care of we had a great time and the sweets were beautiful. It would be really nice to have a refrigerator full of alcohol or candies and juices again so we could pay for our own and not have to go downstairs
40,My overall experience at the Luxor was good. Save yourself the line at check in by using the MGM app to check in and check out. The line seemed to never end. Whether it was 3pm or 10pm there always seemed to be a line.    I stayed in the east tower. Two queen room. It was nice and spacious. The decor is clean and modern. The bed was very comfortable no complaints there. My bathroom could have been cleaned better. There was hair and dirt by the toilet and hairs in the bath tub and along the edge of the tub. It’s a minor issue that I normally wouldn’t worry about except ya know Covid times.    If I ever come back to Vegas I would stay here again. Just be prepared to walk a lot! Unlike the more central strip hotels. But I knew this when I booked the hotel. The strip is not small. Take advantage of the tram and the Duece bus (or Uber or taxi if that’s more your thing) to keep your feet happy.    Just wanted to say thank you to all the workers that keep Vegas running it’s a struggle right now. Hang in there!
50,Definitely a fun and novel experience to sleep 14 floors up in a pyramid great service all around and such yummy food in the Pyramid Cafe. I definitely recommend the Breakfast Pizza it’s a great vegetarian option.
10,Beware of Luxor's false claims. Nowhere in any of the correspondence leading up to our trip did they inform us that both pools at the Luxor were closed during the week. Also this resort is showing its age with 20 years of deferred maintenance. Finally the self parking garage was ridiculous. My key never worked and every time we had to leave we had to press the call button on the gate to get the front desk to raise the gate. Worst stay I've had in 15 trips to Vegas.
50,Week of November 102020 was great at the Luxor . I met how it’s some United States Marine Corps friends from all over the United States of America . We all met up and the Luxor and then partied it up and went to watch Tiesto
10,We were woke up by construction both nights we stayed. A hammer drill in concrete right next to our wall. We called front desk and they transferred us multiple times until we got to security and they said they look into it and hung up. Would not recommend staying here if you like sleeping in past 8am.
30,I don't know why they even have reservation system if they won't honor your reservation. I booked a tower premium king. I was given a queen and a fantastic view of the roof of the casino roof(sarcasm) . I had called earlier in the day to to confirm the room I was getting and was told everything was as per my reservation. They completely lied. Not impressed at all.
50,Staff were incredibly helpful and friendly made sure we had all information we needed; rooms were very neat and clean great place to stay plenty to do even without leaving hotel and the strip is right there!
50,Easy checking amazing staff and great place overall. Had a great time playing slots and all of the staff was so attentive. Checkout was super easy and enjoyed the shows they had in the hotel. Would definitely stay here again.
30,Make sure you check wie staff to ensure elevators are functioning- there were FOUR elevators and only ONE worked. Also before you download the app for MGM make sure that you have good cell phone reception. As you need good reception to get you in your room. There is no room service or coffee in rooms either.    I will not stay here again.
40,For the price there should have been a coffee service a refer and  A microwave in each room. Especially after paying $60 a night  In resort fees. We supposedly were upgraded to a better room when  We checked in but it was just the same room we paid for.
40,Nobody told us how to use the elevator. Plus only one worked completely. Other than that the room was comfy. The staff was friendly. The casino is older but clean and updated. A lot of food options opened late. I'd stay again. It was fun.
50,Sally Rodriquez is a true blessing  and a compliment to Luxor .  While experiencing a challenging time during what is called the Cycle of Life she helped make bring a smile and joyous experience making new memories.
30,Had a “Premium Queen Suite” in the tower don’t know what was premium at all dirty floors no comforter just 2 sheets that were pilling. Told front desk of our dirty floors and showed pictures they said they would sent up house keeping when they came. (Not while we were there) They changed our bedding same dirty floors the whole stay. Short staffed waiting in line for hours if you don’t use the app. Only half the digital key readers actually work in the elevators and the elevators need to be fixed parts are falling off the floor selection panels on almost all of them.
20,The Luxor is in desperate need of a renovation. The rooms were dirty linens soiled and the bed was way too soft...my back is still aching. The food was excellent and service was good but I will never stay there again.
20,"My ""upgraded"" room featured broken curtains a rattling ac unit and sparse bedding. Coffeemaker and minifridge were available for an extra $65 per night. The bathroom was nice except for the extremely loud fan that runs constantly when the lights are on and the shower with no door that splashed water all over the floor so I ended up using more towels than I would have otherwise to mop it up. Food options in this hotel are not great. Location is fine if you want to be close to the airport or the stadium but otherwise you'd be better off somewhere farther north up the Strip. Come for the Bodies exhibit stay ... somewhere else."
10,property poor repair and filthy. run down. walkway under repair before arrival and still 3 days later . staff poorly trained and not enough workers. no maid services due to covid protocol this is not a resort. charged friends valet fee that had no car.
50,Hotel was great. Rooms were very nice and spacious. Food court was convenient. Hotel location is good. Best sleeping mattress of any hotel we have ever stayed at ! So good we looked to see what brand it was and we are buying one for our home.
40,Clean updated rooms. Only downside are no refrigerator or coffee maker. I NEED COFFEE!!! Not too impressed with their casino limited table games went to Mandalay Bay’s casino just a walk through the mall. Luxor offers many different and great shows like AGT and Carrot Top.
50,Everything was wonderful. I stayed in the towers. It was neat and clean the staff were very friendly and nice. I would recommend this hotel to anyone. My room just didn’t have kitchen essentials. Good
30,We really wanted to get a room in the hotel pyramid. We got an upgrade they advised at check in however we were moved to the tower so we missed out on some experience there overall the hotel was clean and easy to get around.
30,I've had better Vegas experiences. This one was not my best yet. The room was overpriced and very outdated. There should be a microwave and a refrigerator in the room and repairs should be done asap. Repairs should not affect the flow of traffic. The elevators on 3B were not completely functional.
40,Would definitely stay here again. You check in and out on your phone. Rooms were good bed was very comfy. Lots to do at there at the hotel. Close to the stadium. Went to see agt and that was a good experience.
10,Worst experience ever….room was unclean when we arrived there was still trash and dirty sheets… after calling down to complain I was not offered another room….housekeeping came up and dropped sheets off at the room as if I was suppose to clean it myself….
20,Do yourself a favor if you want to stay on the strip stay at the flamingo or the New York New York if you want somewhere less expensive the luxury sucks. They don't provide you any information when you check in and then act like it's your fault if something goes wrong and the toilets won't flush your toilet paper FYI
10,Don’t waste your money coming here elevators don’t work you don’t win here and the room will get you sick. Don’t try to get any free upgrades unless you’re an Asian. Book another hotel save yourself A bad experience.
10,"Sold us a $600 room upgrade which was completely overstated. Misled that was ""Penthouse"" FAR FROM IT!!! ROOM WAS DIRTY DATED (ripped carpet broken fixtures ect.) Stay away from this place and don't trust front desk recommendations."
10,Charged more for a strip few. We didn’t even have a view at all. Worst part didn’t have soap to wash your hands. Nor a microwave coffee or refrigerator. Paid $750 for two nights. Not worth it at all
30,Stayed at Luxor for Raider’s game. Hotel is convenient and a good place to stay if you don’t require upscale hotel. It is also close to the airport.    Hotel is dated. Elevators did not function well. Staff was friendly.
40,Overall I had a great time as usual. My previous days I always had a room in the towers I was very excited to have a stay in the pyramid. Like I mentioned I was somewhat disappointed in the extremely low water pressure coming from the bathroom sink. It took a really long time just to simply rents out a toothbrush.
10,The worst Vegas experience. Too much walking from self park to casino. My license plate “went missing” and someone dented my bumper in the self park. I suggest valet (or actually another casino) parking.  While on the casino floor some dude snatched by ticket out of my hand and ran off with it. That was totally unexpected! Assistant Slot Manager Jose was great. However this still shouldn’t happen.  I can sum it up like this….my entire stay was comped and I would never go back
30,I find Vegas tedious at the best of times but I have had better stays in this city. We chose this hotel because we were going to see the Blue Man Group (which was awesome) and their show is in the hotel. We chose to use the advertised contactless check in and were given a corner suite as we had requested however it was only on the third floor and we had specifically requested a high floor when making the reservation. The room (thankfully) still had the funky Egyptian themed decor which I understand they've taken out of most of the other rooms. Such a shame. Themed rooms and hotels is what makes Vegas fun.  Because the room was only on the third floor it had no view and the tub (which was one of the reasons we wanted the room) was under the angled roof making it hard to get into and out of. The room was clean and spacious.  The reason I have given the hotel only a 3 is that the food options are subpar (Nathan's hotdogs in the food court are horrible!) and many of the shops and the fun things the hotel used to have are all gone. In fact the reviews of the buffet at this hotel were so bad that we chose to go to the Excaliber buffet for breakfast instead. Beware that the shuttle has limited hours now too (only starts at 10 am).  I soooooo wish these hotels would go non-smoking. Being anywhere on or near the casino floor is a non-smokers hell. Wearing masks helps filter out some of the smoke but I was still choking on it. I won't be back to Vegas anytime soon.
40,Pros:  The overall stay was good.  Cons:  The bathtub was filling up as we took a shower. So after my wife took a shower I would have to wait 10 to 15 mins for the water to go down before I could take my shower. Maintenance came to the room to fix it but they could not.  We think the person at the Front desk did what they could buy refunded 2 nights worth of the resort fees. We hoped that for the whole trip we could have got the resort fees refunded.
20,The room was freezing and the Heating and Cooling unit would not work to warm the room. We requested maintenance by the phone 2 times and once in the lobby and no one ever showed up.    There were fleas in the room!    The cleaning of the room a couple of the days was very inadequate. It was not vacuumed or wiped down only the towels were changed and the beds made. One day they never showed up and we had to call housekeeping and fortunately that day the lady that showed up did a great job on the room. I asked her to vacuum to hopefully get rid of the fleas but they were still there.    The shower with only a half door is very dangerous because of the water that spills out. It creates a very real slipping hazard!    We were put by the ice and vending machines and the metal ice holders made for very loud noises at night.
20,Our experience at staying in the Luxor was not great in terms of the rooms and the amount of construction they were doing by our room. However the staff food and casino experience was great. Enjoyed gambling and hanging out in the Luxor but probably wouldn’t actually stay there again. However we love mgm resorts and they really do take care of you especially military/veterans. If your able to spend a little more money I would suggest staying in Mandalay Bay and go to the Luxor to visit. We spent a lot of our trip walking to Mandalay Bay which is right next door and would love to try to stay there next time.
20,The public areas of the hotel are fine but the suite was dated. There are no USB ports and all of the furniture was either worn scratched or chipped. Good value if you don't care about this. The suite and bathroom were spacious and the bed was comfortable. The fridge had about 5 years of frost. I know the room is not cleaned well. There was makeup all over the bathroom door.
40,Room was super nice .. very cozy and relaxing..I truly enjoyed my stay.. I would not recommend the pyramid cafe.. i would absolutely stay here again.. very close to the strip and other fun family places
10,"I take the pandemic seriously. Throughout the casino there were signs stating that mask were required ""by law"" and yet every direction I looked I saw hundreds of people in without mask.  Security guards everywhere security cameras everywhere but noone making the tiniest attempt to enforce the law.  I felt completely unsafe and am still afraid I may have gotten infected in your building.  I've visited 3 Native American casinos and all were diligent in there enforcement of mask rules but obviously Luxir could not care less about my safety.  Shameful pathetic disgusting!!!  If it were up to me you'd be shut down for non compliance"
20,Booked the Luxor because we were coming to Vegas to see AGT Live. Booked a King Pyramid room. When we arrived we found ourselves in a twin queen East Tower room. Complained to the front desk as was told the queen twin room was better-- well the walk to the towers was long and the room was basic--- no refrig no coffee maker beds were old- we had 1 shampoo and 1 bar of soap when we got into the room. Then there was the pool- it was closed Mon- Thurs and we had to goto the Mandalay Bay pool (which turned out to be 1000% better than the Luxor pool). On Friday and Saturday the Luxor pool was open BUT only 1 of the 4 pools. The water was ice cold (Mandalay Bay pool must have been heated). The whirlpool was not open- The Luxor oasis bar was out of many beers and seltzers- the pool servers was rude and he acted like he was doing us a favor taking our pool side orders. They did not have any food service at the pool- you had to go into the hotel to get your own food. We saw no mention of this limitations on any notice from the hotel- don't waste your time and money at the Luxor-
10,Hotel is dirty and in need of a total renovation. Smells like a combination of smoke and mold. Elevators are falling apart and have waits of 20 minutes. Trash is left out for days. Windows are filthy and rooms have extras. No mini fridge....
10,I will not be returning to this hotel. You would think during covid that cleaning would be a priority but not so much. There were dirty towels in my room when I arrived. And each day the room was half cleaned.
40,Luxor has lost its luster. It was once something really special. Now its showing its age and offers nothing really special for the price of the room. The room in the West tower was just average. The location is excellent within walking distance to Allegiant Stadium. I would stay elsewhere if you want glitz and pizzazz that Vegas has to offer. If you want a decent place for a concert or football game it will fit the bill.
10,this hotel is one of the worst I’ve been to in a long time. The customer service is horrible. Long walks from parking lot to hotel and room key stopped working for the room and they made me wait almost an hour for me to get back in my room pool not open but still pay “resort” fee plus I paid for parking but every time I go in and out all parking is free for all so why did they make me pay for it I wonder. They have mask Nazis who pick and choose who and when to make wear masks managers threaten you if you complain about the bad customer service. These workers need to be replaced. Sad very sad. The hotel even sends construction workers to work banging hammers around and making all sorts of loud noises in rooms next to guests even at 8:30 am waking the guests up. Very cold room kept freezing and waking me up cold set on 66 and I kept putting it up higher and it would reset to 66 so I kept shutting it off and it kept coming on. I didn’t call because of the front desk manager being such a petty manipulative punk threatening to kick me out for complaining. You need to fire that little terrorist before he really angers another customer. Did that gun shooter at Mandalay Bay experience that punk worker then go off? I don’t ever want to be in any business with him again.
10,Don't stay here. The building is old and out of the way and bears the marks of decay and entropy; the ancient egyptian motif is well-suited here. The elevators will make you want to never leave your room. Half of them are broken in some way or another the two-step process of cardkey and button press is doesn't work more often than not and there's no staff near any of the elevators to address the issue with meaning you'll have to dedicate yourself if you want a solution. The rooms are over-priced. There are so many better options on the strip.
50,Really enjoyed our stay on the 2nd floor during Nov 2021. Mobile check-in/out allowed us to avoid reception. Electronic door locks worked fine with our smartphones. Room was clean and well decorated. Had to request a hair dryer which wasn't in the room. Staff were professional when requesting additional pillows and hair dryer.
10,My room was not clean as expected. Furniture dirty mirrors not clean hair in tub sink dirty barely hot water sheets had hair on them. I voiced my complaint to the front clerks and my room number was only written down and voiced they would tell housekeeping. Situation not fixed.
50,My trip was great this place held up to my expectations.This hotel is awesome the bars are clean and the music is lively. Also super affordable and the staff was polite and extremely helpful. I will be staying here again.
20,"Unfortunately this beautiful building is in need of a remodel. The rooms are rundown and that's the ""upgraded rooms"". You can feel every spring in the beds the air in the room seem to struggle to keep the room cool. Just little upkeep wasn't even there for example the plugs in the bathroom were broken. The elevator were malfunctioning so it was hard to get to the room floor. Just over all disappointed. Honestly circus circus was better then this place."
20,Service staff was great with what they had to work with. No amenities in room. The facility needs a going over and needs to be freshened up. Hotel Unmaintained !!!!!!!!'!!!!!!!!! Hotel Unmaintained '!!!!!!!!!!!!
40,Visited the Luxor for 4 days. Fathers and sons (21st bdays). We had used MGM app to pre checkin. It was first floor room so we went to change room after security guy said it would be loud w Americas Got Talent. Check in was crowded but we asked for help and the guy pulled us from the line and took us to the priority line. Changed to 15th floor. Elevators move diagonally-kinda neat but were broken frequently leading to long wait lines and full elevators when the doors open. The diagonal movement doesn’t help if you’re drunk (not that anyone in Vegas drinks). Rooms were OK. Beds don’t have comforters. Just a blanket and sheet. Had to turn up heat. Baths have contemporary design (read nonfunctional). No towel rack in the bathroom or shower. The shower glass is only half the length of the shower so water gets all over the floor. Who does that kind of design?? No fridge in the room which forces you to buy over-priced beverages from the hotel store. BTW this complex (Luxor Mandalay Bay and Excalibur) are all owned by MGM with tunnels interconnected between them. Pretty nice way to move between them. However this area is food desert with no nearby food/liquor stores so you have to travel to bring back beverages but won’t keep them cold. Staff is very helpful. Rafael the bellman has been there for 25 years. Nice guy!
10,Rooms were not clean. There was hair in the soaking tub and shower drain. Shower would not drain and would flood the bathroom if you took more than 5 minutes to shower. Water pressure was awful. Fan in the bathroom and above the soaking tub did not work. Faucet in the bathroom was very loose and would wiggle around. Staff offered no solutions but instead just kept telling us to call back later. We would be out on hold for at least 45 minutes every time we called. Do not recommend this place.
40,Enjoyed staying on this end of the strip was a nice change. The staff at Luxor went above and beyond. Bed was super comfy room was renovated. Not enough storage in the room or bathroom but i probably brought too much stuff. :)  Will be back.
40,We accepted a 4-night comp suite in the east tower of Luxor. Second time in a tower suite. 18th floor overlooking the airport and southern Strip. Much better than a pyramid suite (especially the quicker elevators) but furniture is starting to look worn. Clean and comfortable overall including the carpet. The smell of dope is becoming more prominent outdoors. Casino offers a good variety of options. Parking garage was fine until we tried to leave — suddenly the cameras don’t recognize our plates or our platinum Mlife card.
10,I had the misfortune to book a room at the Luxor for a quick weekend stay in Las Vegas. I paid for the “upgraded- remodeled room”. Not sure what decade the room was remodeled - not sure it happened in the 21st century. However I looked past the disingenuous advertising and told myself it was only going to be for less than 24 hours and just deal with the outdated decor. Well the metallic wallpaper and dirty chair were only the beginning.  I noticed that there was not a blow dryer in the room and that the only bath products in the room was a half used (ugh) container of shampoo. Ok I thought I will deal with that later. Woke up Sunday am and called for the missing items and after forty minutes (and two incorrect deliveries) I received the dryer and unused bath products. I started the water and kept waiting for the hot water which never happened. I called the front desk and instead of getting information about what was going on with the hotel’s plumbing I was told that I was #5 on the list for the maintenance person to come and try to resolve the issue. After about thirty minutes two nice men came by and told me the entire 1/2 of the building was out of hot water and it would be resolved in the next 45 minutes or so. Anywho of course I would have appreciated hearing this information earlier instead of being led to believe that it was just a small issue in my room only. In conclusion I will never stay at Luxor again and would not recommend this hotel to friends or family.
50,My only complaint is the elevators were slow! Nice room comfy bed. Good food options. The Pyramid rooms are pretty cool! Really enjoyed our stay. The staff was great very friendly and helpful. Had a little trouble with their app but they helped me through it!
50,I stayed at the East Tower at the Luxor and the suite is different from the regular rooms. Extremely large it was a full one bedroom and new. Very clean room service is great and close to Mandalay Bay Convention Center.
10,A very poorly maintained property with poor customer service. Restaurants are not open staff is too busy to answer the phone and handle issues in the room or maintenance. You will be disappointed if you stay at this property. I live in Las Vegas and stay everywhere and this was my worst experience EVER!
10,Well where do i start? There were bugs(cockroaches & giant spiders) in BOTH of the rooms we were placed in. My sister/brother in-laws room also had cockroaches and all of our rooms had mold behind the curtains to the point the wall paper was peeling off. The towels were filthy and had someone else’s makeup on it. The customer service we received from the buffet to bars to restaurants & walk-ups was less than mediocre. This was our first experience ever staying at an MGM property & to say we are disappointed is being nice. I am disgusted to say that there were roaches and mice throughout the public bathrooms & outside the hotel while waiting for rideshare. We spent over $2000 between food hotels(both the Luxor and Excalibur) and fees. When we went to ask for some help or something that could be done we were very rudely told by Jurgen that the conversation stops when asking for 1 of our most expensive nights comped and that I needed to calm down or the conversation would end. Which my NEW husband(the whole reason for our trip & stay) was there & I was not yelling or even had a raised voice. Our entire wedding party stayed at the Luxor and all of them had issues. The food was overly priced & lack luster. The drinks were over priced & watered down. The Air conditioner would not set at a specific fan speed or temperature even all of the bell hops who assisted us commented how much warmer our rooms were then the hallway & we had it set at 60 the lowest setting. There is no room service offered when OTHER MGM properties & hotels along the strip are offering it EVEN WITH COVID. Valet took upwards of an hour to get in when the valet guy was taking cash to watch peoples cars who were not guests of the Luxor and we were told to wait (45 mins) and we were guests of the hotel. I will never recommend the Luxor to ANYONE.
50,I celebrated my 40th birthday at the Luxor and had a blast from the time I arrived at the Luxor. I’ll definitely be staying here again the next time I come to visit Vegas!!! Hopefully I’ll win big that time!
10,I would not recommend staying at this property. It is older and it needs some renovations or updates. There is very old furniture as well they need to do a better job of cleaning the property. I will never stay there again.
50,Once we got past using the horrible app to try and check in stay was awesome that's why the five stars they really need to spend some money on the check-in process  Really nice rooms no wait at the restaurants very well positioned hotel
10,We have stay at the MGM properties for a long time specially the Luxor this time it was very dissatisfied and disappointed we ask for the wellness room since I have high allergies well… the filter was in need to be changed we call  they send a guy  instead of changing the filter he opens the grill wipe it down and he said ok is done he left I looked at the machine and still said “ filter needs replacement “ we contact someone again and we never got anyone back the shower supposed to have a orange infusion and it was empty I found hairs on my towels and the bed had black spots like dirt ton top musky smell  when we left I went down to check out the front desk person was rude after I told him about the room he said if you want to leave a complaint go to TripAdvisor he gives me my paperwork and I got charge 500 and something 2 days later I started to get more charges on my credit card. So…. Definitely not going back there again.
20,Our room was dirty the bathroom was dirty and the toilet wasn’t cleaned from the last person in it. There was hair all over it. The sink was clogged and no one would answer to come fix it. The room also smelled bad.
50,The first floor room was spacious clean and the beds were truly comfortable. Plenty of rest and relaxing some before headed to the floor for a little light refreshments. The digital checkin/checkout was so easy and effortless it’s the way of the future and a very safe and sanitary way of doing things during the pandemic. The buffet diablos and public house food options were all delicious and fair priced am eager to go back and try them again my favorites were the endless mimosas at all he buffet and fresh fruit. The pub house”a fish and chips and Diablos ceviche. The MSB cocktail in the lounge was out of this world good.
10,The room still had dirty clothes in the dresser and dirty toothbrush and deodorant stick in the draws the sink and toilet where plugged. We got the corner king tub in corner of room it was dirty. I would like some kind of refund $1000.00 for 3 nights this room should have been immaculate.
20,Our shower drain was clogged and the toilet didn't flush. We called for maintenance multiple times but not one person ever showed up to resolve the issue. We had to use the restroom and shower at our family member's hotel room which was in a whole different building. Very inconvenient.
10,We experienced roaches crawling in our room and there were dead roaches on our carpet. The bathroom floors were not clean at all we didn't have enough wash cloth to accommodate the amount of guest in the room.
50,This was our second time staying at The Luxor in the last two years and we love it! We will be staying there exclusively from now on. The staff guest rooms and amenities are all great. You are close to the monorail so travel up and down the strip is easy. We highly recommend staying there.
20,Floors look either stained or never cleaned in the hallways and elevators have gang graffiti in them. When booking your room you won't get what you pay for. Reservations and the hotel have NO communication.
40,Staff was nice. Hotel was very clean. Everything you need could be found at the hotel. Amenities were good. I would definitely recommend to my friends and family. I brought my dog with me and they had pet friendly areas located in convenient areas.
40,Only a short cab ride from the airport but never heard an airplane. Perfect location to see the entire strip even on foot. Classic Las Vegas hotel with an outstanding view and an even better theme. Casino was up to date with latest games
10,$5 room upgrade Wi-Fi never worked zero help from Front Desk or IT support. Lukewarm food at Pyramid Cafe 25 minutes to get an omelette correct on the third try. Construction banging in the morning. And a resort charge for services never used explained to Check-In that we had no desire to use facilities but charged anyway.
40,Nice rooms. Super clean. Staff was knowledgeable and friendly. No bath or shower door was kind of a bummer. Can get a bit loud if people are partying in the hallway on your one night of real sleep but still better then a lot of places I’ve stayed. Food was amazing.
30,The hotel charges 4 - 5 STAR prices for 3 STAR accommodations. It may have a “pretty face” but it clearly needs a LOT of renovations. They appear to be under-staffed and guests are paying for it - a LOT more than they should be. From the shaky creaking elevators to the lack of sufficient room service it’s an expensive choice compared to Las Vegas’s multitude of better options.
10,VEry disappintin that the direction to your room still after 10 years lead you to make a complete circle in the wrong direction. Not that big of a deal unless you are handicap but super upset at the constant waste of time. Hotel staff point all patrons to one elevator when you could use two and cut down on the line that wraps around all the way to the desk area. NOT OK to have the same lame experience year after year. WONT stay again. Tables are to expensive and so are the shows. The place appears clean but the showers always back up and I found hair in my bed. SLEPT in the other with my buddy because it was too much of a hassle to complain. The moving walkways always broke and the pool is always cold.
50,Easy early check in at no additional cost. App check in. Nice/clean rooms. Casino was nice and clean. Would definitely recommend staying here while visiting Vegas. Walkways to nearby hotels and a good perk.
30,Luxor is older and needs some updating. Our bathroom shower was poorly remodeled. The bathroom door stuck and the toilet didn’t function all that well. There was no fridge in the room. The room was clean enough and the bed was comfortable enough. Nice sit down dining was limited.
30,My fiance and I stayed here during a mid-week getaway Wednesday through Friday. I used Priceline and Luxor was chosen out of three possible hotels. I was hoping for either one of the others and our experience validated my initial thoughts. Our stay was just okay. Could have been better with more attentive staff and a room on a higher floor. The first 5 floors are not desirable.
10,The restaurants were sub par the hotel staff barges into the room unannounced and stumbles to leave when you ask them to. The cell phone service is awful and the mini fridge I requested for an additional charge was almost not worth the hassle to get.
20,To start offif you have a chance ask questions before you book at Luxor Hotel. Lots of negatives for more than 1 day stay. Water from sink in restroom smells like sewerremodeling going on. No washing machine or fridge or microwave in rooms
20,Staff was sparse outside of the front desk during the week - no one said hi if you did see a staff member and it just seemed to be lacking the hospitality I have come to know at MGM properties. This was a work trip and I did not get to pick my hotel but this was not what I was expecting from this brand/
10,Rundown dilapidated or malfunctioning amenities coupled with exorbitant parking and other fees. No longer a jewel on the strip or good value for money. Used to be one of my favorite hotels in the strip but after the gouging I just experienced I will not return.
20,We were excited for a much needed mini vacation and booked the Luxor believing we'd be staying in a fun luxury suite. It was outdated small and a huge disappointment. The bed was comfortable however unless you have large shoulders the pillows are way too big for a good night sleep. Expect to pay high bucks and wait over 30 minutes for morning coffee at only one open Starbucks even though they have three. If the pool is closed you get to go to another MGM pool but don't expect any shade unless you pay $50 for poolside chaise and an extra $10 for an umbrella. Oh and take food or pay another $50 for a burger and drink. In other words win at the casino to pay for amenities even a 2 star hotel provides that is if you can afford to gamble after all the extra things are purchased.
50,I enjoyed my stay just no volume on the movies I purchased. Yarlita (I hope I’m spelling her name correctly) was nothing short of amazing. Thank you for being the beautiful person you are! Stay blessed
10,Stayed at several MGM hotel/casino this by far is the worst.  No makeup mirror in guest rooms bathroom. No water for your coffee. 15 minute walk from room to casino/ restaurants. Road noise at night. Just awful
20,Although they have updated their rooms in the main pyramid - if you walk in and it feels like a swamp - not sure if they have a water leak or what. Plan on extremely long lines at check-in. I wouldn't recommend if you are there for business
30,The room could use a little maintenance. The cleanliness could be a little better.We arrived late from the airport and found all the restaurants closed with nothing to eat except one 24 hour store with pre-made sandwiches.
50,I stayed at the Luxor on a very busy weekend and was taken care of very well despite not staying in one of their more expensive rooms. The room was beautiful and very clean. From cleaning staff to restaurant and casino staff I interacted with everyone was helpful and positive. Ideally it is best not to travel solo especially as a female but staff were kind and helpful enough that I was able to navigate the beautiful Egyptian maze at this hotel. Would definitely stay here again with friends and reserve one of the nicer suites. Only reason I'll give the room 4 stars instead of 5 is because there was no mini fridge and it would've been ideal to put leftover food there or to have snacks...but that's more on me and my poor planning not on the hotel. Thank you Luxor :-)
30,My son and I went to Las Vegas for a guys weekend. We saw a few shows including the Rolling Stones (Fantastic BTW). We stayed that the Luxor and it was OK. The pool is nice but 1/2 was closed. The facility had not been updated in quite a while. On more than one occasion the Common areas were not clean. The room was nice but not where you spent a lot of time. The TV was from 1995. Staff were very friendly. There are nicer casinos on the strip MGM owned and others. If you don't care about the amenities and Luxor has a good deal take it. If you want to posh and pampered you might need to look elsewhere.
40,For our first time in Vegas the Luxor & its staff made it a great experience. The main casino and show floors with all its restaurants and shopping for definitely Vegas! Large and full of life and quite the experience.
40,Rooms are clean hotel is nice staff is friendly. 50th birthday trip to Vegas  Always stay at an MGM property. Luxor is one of my favorites. Easy to get around good food reasonably priced games. Great value
10,The room was far from my expectation. The so called “premium” is a joke. This is nothing near premium. Low quality bed and pillows. The lighting in the room was too dark. It’s such an inconvenience. Bathroom is filthy. Mold on the shower tile and on the shower-head stained bathtub sink. Just disgusting. Imagine taking a shower and looking at the mold at the same time.
40,This was my 15th visit of Las Vegas. The first time in Luxor. Wasn't sure about the pyramid shape but it turned up to be a positive experience. Just like about 75% of Casinos and Hotels in Vegas Luxor could use little face lift. Overall I would stay again.
50,I enjoyed just being able to relax N room & watch T.V. With my dogs & had a very great Bday. I was very pleased & satisfied with the room & h the he stay. It was the best time of my life. I loved how my dogs were welcomed at check in.
40,Front desk was great! Steve represented best efforts to help us get a good room. Very professional.  Room was not well cleaned from previous guests. Only 4 hangers provided requested a couple more from housekeeping and was told only 4 provided. Closet doors had some left over sprayed substance on them from previous guests carpets were not well vacuumed left over guest face mask was at foot of bed clothes lable was in drawer.  Location was great parking very good for self park.  Many slots had left over used ashtrays.  M-life desk was super helpful.  Nurture spa was great staff wonderful and massuess perfect.  Check out @ 5 AM was fast and easy
50,Been staying here gambling here relaxing here drinking here bringing friends and family here dining here for 15-20 years! Friendly and attentive staff clean restrooms good covid cleanliness protocol convenient location to many shoppes and eateries without ever going outdoors.
10,Elevators were hard to find the readers in my elevators the readers were broke couldn't print a card and they wanted me to wait in line for an hour to get one. Buffer was awful prices outrageous. Only good thing is that it was all comped.
10,My mother and I went to Luxor as a side trip from our tour of Utah on my 50th birthday. We were not told that America’s Got Talent would be there and that we would need to make arrangements for parking before our arrival. Specifically valet. We arrived at 3 pm and had to wait for an hour to get to the valet where we were told that we could get “premium valet only.” It was $20 up front then $30 upon checking out the next morning. When we finally got checked in we were sent to the back of the hotel to the green elevators to go up to the tenth floor. When the group that we got on the elevator with got on a gentleman likened it to being on the Wonka Vator from “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.” It shook terribly. He said he thought it might go sideways shoot out of the top of the building or drop. There were four elevators in the bank. One of them stayed stuck on the second floor the entire time we were there. I tried the others two elevators both of them shook too. When we got to the room we wanted to get ready to go out to dinner and try a little gambling. We then noticed our room didn’t have any soap shampoo or any other self care items. Nor did it have a hair dryer. I called the house keeping department and was told that the hotel was full and that other guests that had aready checked in were priority. I would not be able to get a hair dryer. WHAT!?!?!?!!! I’ve never had this happen and I am an avid traveler both internationally and stateside. Once we made it to the casino we were welcomed by an employee. He asked where we were from. I stated “Atlanta Georgia.” He said “Oh England welcome to our country.” Again what?? The next morning the self check out kiosks were not working so we waited in line for an hour then waited for another hour for our car at the valet. Only to find out that our car keys had been lost. We truly couldn’t leave fast enough.
30,I have to the room was clean with plenty of room. Nicely appointed. Good shower and tub. Downside is that the casino is the lobby and main area is not well lit. Also the tv was really annoying. Normally in. Rags I never even turn it on but this trip left we tired in the room several nights wanting to kick back and watch a little tv. Half the channels would pop on for 5 seconds then a message would kick in saying channel not in service
30,The elevators were very confusing and not operating. The hallways had moldy carpet and trash everywhere. The dust on the ceiling was an inch thick. The room itself was more updated and clean. The bed was comfortable.
30,Not too bad of of a hotel but rooms need a lot of renovations for sure I like that we didn’t have to check in at the front desk mobile access was great but when it came to use the app for the elevator and room it was a hit and miss but I was able to do a room key which made it better
30,Overall checkin was difficult no one was around to help room was fine besides temperature never getting to where you set it room always smelled of weed when we would get to our room elevators are disgusting and extremely rough. Overall won’t be staying again.
10,This place is so dirty  beds are very uncomfortable and staff are so rude. The place is dark noisy and does not offer healthy food options. Beverage price is outrageous. I paid $20 for a glass of A gin and tonic. Very disappointing.
20,Don't expect a coffee pot or fridge in your room. The beds are ok one of ours dipped in the middle. Everything was so overpriced we found a bar outside the strip. Overall I won't be staying there again.
30,"Basic necessities. Comfy and clean. Great price for the location right on the Vegas strip. We got turned around/lost very often and the map didn't help much. The interior is definitely aged but I don't require fancy some would use the phrase ""you get what you pay for"". Mobile check in and mobile room key made our stay much less stressful and way more efficient with our time. This hotel did exactly what I needed for this trip so no major complaints but also don't expect perfection."
10,You should heed all the bad reviews this resort has. Tired and in need of an update    We checked in online but still had to stand in line for over an hour to get the keys. Mobile key was not working. Filthy elevators and as we walked to our pyramid corner suite it seems ppl have decided that throwing trash down on the structures beneath is ok. The Managment apparently thinks this is ok to as it seems a lot of trash has been there for a while. No coffee maker or couch as shown in the online pics. Our bathroom door fell off the hinges and there were smears of a red sticky substance around the door frame.  We stayed here for convenience to get to allegiant stadium. If you’re staying for the same reason stay at the Delano or Mandalay Bay. You’ll be glad you did.
10,It has been 8 days since we returned home from Las Vegas and 9 days since we were robbed at the Luxor.  It has also been 9 days since anyone from the property communicated anything to us despite being assured we would hear from someone the very same night.  Our rooms were entered without force our belongings were tossed and extensively searched and personal items and money were stolen.  Our doors were locked when the theives left our rooms.  We did not receive a copy of our Reports did not receive a case number and did not reeceive a call from the Front Desk as we were instructed to wait in our room to receive. When I requested a Late Check out (we finished with Security and repacking at 2am) I was charged $35.00 (standard fee).  For the past 8 days we have been trying to contact the Luxor or anyone at MGM to follow up. This company has made it virtually impossible to do so. Tuesday of this week (today is Thursday) my husband finally got a Live Person! The concierge at the Bellagio!  Eric the concierge was defensive and petulant. He took our contact information reluctantly and promised us a call within the next 24 hours. It is now 48 hours and there has been no call or contact made.  My husband and I took this trip with our friend who is in remission from an aggressive cancer. This trip was the highlight of this guest's life. Having experienced homelssness at times you can imagine how their personal keys (auto apartment Post Office box) hold great personal value. These keys were one of the items stolen.  I wish I didn't have to write this. I waited I tried to connect for information.  I just cannot believe this is what MGM Properties has become.
50,Such a great location restaurants are good and the staff was really helpful. Easy and fast online check in. Our room was ready by the time we arrived and we just had to walk in and use our cell phone app to open the door.
10,Had to wait for one hour to check in. Once we got to the counter was told my room was no longer available. It only took 3 mins to check-in at the counter. Now they will send line sharks to upsell you which will speed up your service. If you like to overpay and have a lower quality of service this is the place for you.
50,I enjoyed my stay had a convention at the sister property the stay was great only thing I did not like was the pricing of food Wayover priced breakfast should not cost $30 also a steak $67 If it cost that much what the Hell are you feeding them
50,Luxor is my home away from home. I go several times a year and am warmly received by all. The people who work there are so special. From the Starbucks to the steakhouse. From the machines to the Centra bar. They all make me feel so good. I recommend the tower rooms for sure. Comfortable and affordable and located so close to other mgm properties. Enjoy!
50,Marvelous suite-great food at Diablo. Can't wait to visit again in January. MGM has wonderful casinos. Lots of slots & games to play. Eating at bar counter was just as good as sitting at table. Wonderfully attentive bartenders.
50,The hotel is great. We have stayed here 3 times and it has not failed. We have stayed at the tower premium and the pyramid rooms and we highly recommend. We have not had any issues. Will recommend. 10/10
50,The stay at the Luxor hotel casino was just as awesome as the last year when I stayed with my daughter the front desk clerk that checked me in was so friendly and helpful and explained everything in detail and did it quick and easy
50,"The Luxor was the first hotel that I stayed and in Vegas. That being said I may be slightly biased however that was 20 years ago and I've loved it every since. Very good service from check-in to Check out. I highly recommend the LUXOR as there are many aspects of this property to love. The pools are AWESOME. The food is AWESOME the Scenery is AWESOME. (Little known fact for newbies. Will smith's ""Get Jiggy with it"" was filmed at the Luxor Lobby) so sing it loudly while walking though and legend has it you win big! Really though great property great Staff and an even better stay. Conveniently located to other properties as well."
40,Was upgraded to a better room because my room selection was overbooked. Room was very good and clean. Only issues was TV keeps disconnecting/freezing. First time in tower. Over all pretty good and would stay again.
50,If you are going to an event at Allegiant Stadium my advice is to stay at the Luxor Casino Hotel. You can just walk over to the stadium. Easy. The staff are all friendly and helpful. We had an awesome suite in the east tower that was worth the walk to get to.
50,Rooms where exactly clean and well taking care of. Resort was well maintained and staff was pretty friendly. Mask mandatory so always keep one on you. Definitely be staying here again for the next sema show!
50,My friends and I attended EDC this past October. Everything from the speed of the check-in process to the kind hospitality from the staff made this Luxor stay one to remember. LOTS of food options on site really made it so that you didn’t really have to leave. Definitely will be a repeat customer.
50,Our stay at the hotel was awesome it had a lot of options for food and drinks. The fantasy show was awesome would definitely go and see tho again! Our suite was very nice and the pool was very fun our family is definitely going to stay there again
30,So glad we stayed during the week because this room would not be worth $100 let alone the $300 they charge on some weekends. Several items needed to be fixed. It had been renovated but not completely finished. Also the sound of the elevator motor could be heard all night.
10,Toilet didn’t work. Had two rooms and the toiletries were different in both. One only had one shampoo. And the other only had a bar of soap. The rooms were dusty. Also. Heard every single person walking by and running water from the next rooms. Never again.
20,Stains and other people’s hair in the bedsheets and pillows. Stains on the walls. Room reeked of smoke even though it was a smoke free room. Getting a medical fridge was a nightmare- delivered in the middle of the night while I was sleeping. Very obvious water damage on the ceiling. Thought we booked a newly refurbished room. Would hate to see what the old ones looked like. Vegas definitely wasn’t us so doubt we will ever be back.
50,Luxor is the hotel that always causes a good trip to turn into an EPIC experince. The unique Egyptian theme the great location the delicious food choices that it has in with the Buffet is the best!  as well as the good vibes of the staff members always helping out!
20,I have stayed at other casinos before with a way better experience. Checking in was a nightmare. The lines were extremely long and staff was somewhat rude. Of course this is just my opinion but I won't choose to stay there again
10,When you hear luxor you think of luxury but no far from it very disappointing overpriced lower melodies. Even though you get a great deal about the room when you pay the resort fees on top of thatop of that just makes you feel like the lake you overpaid
40,We enjoy staying here because it is connected to the Mandalay Bay. Plus the tram takes us to the Excalibur casino without having to walk. We get two casinos (almost three) and amenities for the price of one!
20,Upon returning in November 21 i found roaches in the bathroom of my room in the tower along with a broken air conditioning unit. Once downgraded without compensation i was moved to a room in the pyramid… where the bathroom was covered in another guests hair…
40,The casino is well kept and the staff are very friendly. The inclinators and halls could use a refresh but kept clean and in order. Good selection of food choices but the food court offerings are quite overpriced. Pyramid Cafe serves a delicious breakfast with terrific staff but the signage/instruction for COVID seating procedures need to be a bit more visual.
50,I stayed at the Luxor for five nights and loved every minute of it. The rooms are clean and spacious. I like to gamble that’s a given but you can’t overlook how wonderful the staff are. From the time I checked in to every Bartender server dealer and the housekeepers everyone was so nice and willing to help with all my needs. Definitely recommend a stop in even if you’re not staying.
10,I would thinks it's name would speak for itself but unfortunately most definitely did not. I wount recommend it nore ever stay in it again. The parking is charged per day 20 dollars reallyyyyy immpaying my stay and I have to pay to park. I might as well be charged to use ur bathrooms too. I just was hoping to have an amazing time but I did not
10,We requested and were told we were given handicap room. The room was not a handicap room. Toilets low to the ground so were the beds. Beds were uncomfortable my wife and I both woke up with sore backs all three days. Worst experience ever never again.
40,Nice hotel that i always enjoyed had some issues with the cable programming but am sure it was isolated to this visit other than that everyone was professional helpful hotel is clean feels safe.  I would stay again.
30,We stayed here 10 years ago and we just stayed last week. Needs to be updated. Bed was VERY hard and uncomfortable. No bath tub only shower. Shower design is poor as water went everywhere. Make reservations for all restaurants. Buffet does not serve dinner only breakfast/lunch. No seafood buffet anywhere in Vegas since COVID.
50,It was such a good first Vegas experience. I wish I had gone sooner. I went with family and friends but I would love to go again even as a solo trip I liked the location of the hotel and all it had to offer for my first time there.
50,This is the first time we’ve traveled since the pandemic. The Luxor was exceptionally clean & masks were required in all public settings. This was a very relaxing vacation and lots of fun. We will be back.
30,Overall stay was okay. Rooms were nicer than many describe in other reviews. We slept well. We had adjoining doubles in the west tower. Large room clean and quiet with walk-in shower and separate tub. Staff was friendly.    But … oh the lines. We came Sunday for a few days. It is quiet time in Vegas and the hotel wasn’t busy. But line for checkin bell drop and MGM players club were at least 30 minutes each time. Used mobile checkin with early checkin option ($20) but still had to talk with someone to get my rooms. Had to wait in the mgm club line 3 different times to get various perks.    Casino is better than expected with lots of big name games plenty of tables etc. however since the hotel wasn’t very full only limited tables were open especially in the morning.    Food was tasty. But many places aren’t open or close early.    This was a girls trip and we were keep it cheaper with free rooms ( resort fee required ) . Next time we will pay a little $$ and stay at Mandalay Bay or someplace else down the strip.
10,This place is a certified dump!. You are nothing but a number to them. No service whatsoever! I would not stay at an MGM-Mirage property anymore. I am a gold member and still failure at every level of service in every department.
50,Went for a weekend to see the Stones. Able to see many attractions without a car. Very busy at check-in but they really moved the line. Absolutely no hassles. Saw Carrot Top and AGT shows- great options right at the hotel
40,Great location if you are attending an event at Allegiant Stadium. Check-in was super easy using their keyless check-in app. The room was clean and beds were very comfy. Only downside was the air/heat unit was only blowing cold. The heat never came out warm. Overall nice place to stay.
30,They over sell the rooms so if you're one of the unfortunate ones like myself you get stuck with whatever they have left. Our toilet was extremely loud and the bathtub took forever to fill. Wouldn't stay here again
10,Late check out fee cost more than an entire room night. Rooms sold by the front desk are twice the cost of those sold online. No water in the room. The hotel lures you in with a low and then gouges you at every opportunity.
30,Price was decent. No amenities in the room such as fridge microwave coffee maker water bottles etc. Nice size room comfortable bed. Hard to get help from staff. Housekeeping never came for 4 days
30,The Luxor is in need of major upgrades and maintenance. The fixtures were showing wear and the room had dirt in the crevices. The bed was fairly comfortable. The water pressure was awful. The staff is neither rude nor helpful - they're just kinda there doing the minimum required. I expected better and will not stay there again.
50,I loved staying at the Luxor. It's very convenient to move around to the other hotels and casino's on the Strip. I loved being able to take the tram to either Madalay Bay or Excaliber and then onto NYNY and MGM Grand.
10,Establishment in need of a major upgrade. Outdated and bathroom lacked cleanliness. If bed bugs are your thing then you would enjoy staying here. Pool closes at 4:00 p.m and service in a cabana was not what I would expect.
40,This hotel is an icon it has the most incredible architechture.  I loved the location at the Strip.  Do not miss the exhibitions they are very interesting.  The Tender Steakhouse is an absolute must you should also try the Diablo's Cantina great Mex Food.
20,Overpriced outdated room. If you only need a room for 1 night to get a plane it's adequate. To stay there on vacation no thanks. No room amenities furniture scratched/old room dreary. Not much restaurant choice. Overpriced because of close location to Allegiant Stadium. You can walk from the Luxor to the Stadium.
20,too expensive for the hotel waiting for long time for elevator.Hotel is definitely out dated. Outlets need to be updated bathrooms definitely need to be updated at least with sliding doors that close to keep the water from splashing all over the bathroom floor or at least shower curtains and install some towel racks so that guest don't have to keep calling housekeeping to bring more towels. Whenever we took a shower we'd need to use most of the towels to cover the floor so that bathroom wasn't soaked in water you know because the shower didn't have doors that closed or have shower curtains to keep the water inside the shower.
10,This hotel has nothing to offer food sucks prices are way too high and its far from everything. We had staff enter our room unannounced several times. Paid for a late check out and didn't even get to enjoy it due to being disturbed repeatedly trash throughout the hotel and service sucks.
50,Very nice place great food choices. Staff was very polite and hospitable. It was a short stay only one night but the location gave me quick and easy access to the freeway which was a blessing for traffic
20,I was very upset that at registration my room got switched. I was supposed to be in the pyramid and got put in the East tower. I was so far away from the casino that my fiance had a hard time walking.
20,We booked one specific room type and had it reserved for months. When we got there they told us that the room was not available but that we were getting an 'upgrade' to a better type. The room we got was basic and not at all an upgrade. We were also put on the lowest possible floor which felt like a slap in the face. The front desk staff just kept telling us that it was all they could do. The check in process was painful and the lobby was such a mess and VERY LOUD that you could not even hear them as you spoke to them. I do not recommend the Luxor.
20,While the staff in the restaurants and bars provide excellent service our overall experience was disappointing. Housekeeping was poor at best…not ok especially in the midst of a pandemic. We stayed 3 nights. First night trash had not been emptied. The second day we were out from about 10am-4pm and our room was completely untouched. Called Housekeeping as we were going out for the evening to request the room be serviced. When we returned the bed had been made towels replenished trash emptied but one pillow did not have a pillow case and the bathroom counter and night stand did not appear to have been wiped down/disinfected as there were visible water stains on them. Plus there were multiple stains on the carpet.    The bed and pillows were comfortable so we slept well.    While I read some reviews complaining about the shower we were satisfied with the one in our room.    Again overall the staff we encountered were really fantastic…our stay at Luxor was disappointing.
10,Lousy attitude from staff. Hotel is old and needs renovation. BJ dealers and even pit bosses are not friendly regardless of how much you wager. Casino host not available in the evening. Restaurant staff at Tender and Pyramid were unpleasant. Terrible stay.
50,We had a comped tower elite 2 bedroom suite for 4 night. It also came with free play and resort credit. We could have chose any MLife resort but chose the Luxor because it had the most credit and free play. We understand that this is one of the lower end MGM resorts but still chose it because of the extra credits. Check in was quick and easy (I guess we timed it right unlike a lot of the reviews) room was clean and cool staff was friendly. Cocktail waitresses seemed to be plentiful but that could be because we tipped? No problem for us though. We didn't come in here expecting Bellaigio room and amenities. Overall good stay and will certainly consider again if a good deal arises.
30,the MAIN COMPLAINT for our room was the bathroom condition. there was a lot of VISABLE MOLD on the ceiling there was a HOLE in the bathroom wall at the shower door. the light fixture in the bathroom was really rusty. the bathroom vent was really dirty and hanging off the wall and didn't work. the size of the room overall was nice but the bathroom needs a lot of work.
50,This was my first time staying/ going to the Luxor. Overall I was very satisfied. I would gladly stay there again. Staff was very friendly. Checkin was quick. We were right in the middle of where we needed to be. It was perfect.
20,I was very dissappointed in the entire package with Luxor. I paid for 4 rooms that they say could not be reimbursed because of a travel agent thing. Im sure that they rented out the rooms anyway to double their money. The Gambling was terrible. I've always been able to win a little. I watched for hours and iddn't see onje payout in the 3 days we were there. I spend a lot of money and will not be back. I had better luck downtown.
10,The room provided was less than OK. No coffee in room not enough towels no microwave no fridge no extra blankets no extra pillows. Not enough soap only one bar one bottle of shampoo one bottle of lotion and the room was hot. It finally cooled down on our third night. Bed was OK; not luxurious. It was nothing luxurious about our stay in the tower. The room was nothing to be excited about. It was kind of clean but when I wiped up some water I spilled in the bathroom the floor was black. Bedding seem to be clean.
40,First time for me to go that far from home. Had a BLAST. Step daughter wanted to get married in Vegas so we went. Room was nice not all I was expecting. No frig. Overall it was good. Pyramid café was great food at a good price.
10,I had taken my mom to Concert for Lionel Richie November 6 2021 and had so much fun best concert I’ve been to but and sadly staying at the Luxor ruined our vacation and we decided to go home one day earlier.
10,The elevators alone should make you never want to stay at this hotel. It is so difficult to get to and from a room there that all people would talk about in the elevators was how annoyed they were with the elevators. It took 30 minutes just to get downstairs at one point because every elevator was full to the brim with people. This happened daily!    There aren’t towel holders in the bathroom and the showers aren’t built correctly so water goes everywhere. I heard so many random people complaining about that.    These are just a few things. Let’s just say that I wasn’t impressed
10,Cockroaches in 4 different rooms. The bed is incredibly uncomfortable its like sleeping on the ground. No room service staff didn't care and started that there really wasn't anything they could do except remove resort fees. Not acceptable.
10,Personal/enjoyment went for a concert and found Luxor as a cheap hotel so I booked won’t be coming back check in staff was miserable to be around lack of people skills made it very awkward right from walking in the door. Not a good way to great the guest and have them excited to be in Vegas.
40,Everything was good. Only exception is the price of Everything was crazy. A pop at the hotel store was 5 bucks. The commute to the center of the strip was a bit of a haul. The commute to Freemont Street was way too long. Our room was mostly clean but needed improvement.
20,Pool closes before the sun set (4 pm)  Garbage in the hallways  My view out the window of my King suite “with a view” was 3 steam pies and a wall from what looked like the basement of the hotel. Do not recommend.
10,I do not recommend staying at the Luxor. Spend a few extra dollars a night to stay elsewhere. So many problems throughout our stay. From construction happening and not being able to sleep a cigarette smelled room and poor customer service
50,The whole experience was phenomenal. I will definitely come back and bringing more guest with me to experience the exceptional service I received. Strongly recommend to any one who want to enjoy their stay in Vegas.
10,The hotel does not have the expected quality and the allocated stars and it is amnily like a Motel 6 with the nice architectural design which is not about the management of the Hotel. They take advantage of the job of the hotel designers but do not know how to run the business. Poor quality in the rooms(literally less facilities than Motel 6) no sign of being a world class hotel only focused on the casino which was not the purpose of the trip front desk does not show their interest in their work not answering to the calls from the rooms no room service and bell desk people are confused with their software without having a clear signage for the guest to explain the procedure.
40,Staff were friendly and attentive. Casino and surrounding areas were kept clean. Staff were quick to ask if assistance was needed and the ones I met were knowledgeable. Shows and Titanic exhibits were great.
10,An absolute dump of a hotel. I spent 15 of the last 25 night at MGM Properties and this was a real disappointment    Check in process is very slow and cumbersome. Elevators are shaky and creaky. Room stinks of must and cigarettes. Walls are dirty. AC and fan couldn’t be adjusted. Carpets were dirty. Toilet paper was see through. Furniture was beat up. Pillows were awful. We upgraded the room but there was no way to tell
10,Check in and valet was extremely disorganized and inefficient.    They encourage people to use a digital check in process that didn’t work as it should. You had to put an absurd amount of information (information that the system should already have from the initial booking) which makes it redundant to start. Even once logging in to check in digitally the app only allowed 1 reservation check in per phone it seems. I had 2 different reservations (multiple people in my party that joined the trip at a later date which required me to submit a secondary reservation) so it allowed me to submit 1 on the app and the other I had to wait in a 3 hour long line to check in when everyone else is attempting to check in at 3pm. Even when I did finally get the digital check in to work for one of my reservations I try to go to my room via elevator 1B where to my surprise you can’t select a floor unless you use a digital key or physical key. Upon trying to access my digital key with in the app while the doors were closed in the elevator the app wouldn’t load so I was Essentially stuck. And Yes I was connected to the WiFi. So I left the elevator and then requested physical keys at the kiosks. Yet another inconvenience.    This brings me to the horrid valet situation.  I was recommended this service by family members due to convenience and assistance with baggage and because I had a baby and additional luggage so I decided to give it a try. Upon pulling in at 3pm I was left waiting in the valet line for 20 minutes for someone to arrive to my car with a baggage cart with no car keys (valet host already took them and logged them with a ticket.) The baggage Bell Hop finally arrives 20 minutes later and logs my bags with a ticket and explains the process to me where she instructs me to call the bell hop desk to retrieve my luggage (I am new to Valet so I wasn’t sure this was normal procedures or not) I didn’t understand that after all of the waiting I had already done why the person who arrived with the cart wouldn’t just follow me to my room but instead just dump it off in some unknown location. I continued to my room and called the bell hop desk as instructed. I was on hold for another 10 minutes before speaking to someone where they asked for my identification ticket to find my luggage cart. This apparently caused mass confusion because after reading the ticket number out very clearly they accuse me of having the wrong ticket missing a number or an old ticket etc and told me that there was no luggage logged under that tag number. Extremely frustrated by this process because I was then passed to 2 or 3 different representatives all of which kept asking me to repress the number and last name on the tag still to no avail. Placed on hold again when someone tells me they had to manually find my cart. By the time I got my car parked and my luggage to my room from a service that was suppose to carry the highest convenience for their guests I could have self parked and made multiple trips with my own luggage if need be in far less time. All in all it took an hour and 45 minutes to get these issues resolved and finally get my luggage. Now we settle into the room get our baby relaxed and turn the air on to cool off a bit. About 30 minutes after resting the corner of our room began rattling and shaking with the sound of metal clicking that only seemed to get louder and gain more friction. I turned off my AC to see if that was the problem but of course not that would be too easy to understand. I tried gentle touching/pressing on the wall where the noise is coming from and the sound started to go away but as soon as you removed your hand from the wall it would continue again. The noise was very loud at times and quiet in others. I have a video of this to show. I tried calling this into the guest services front desk. Another 10-15 minutes elapsed before anyone answered a phone. I explained the issue they stated someone would be on their way to check it out soon and waiting in the room/getting ready to head out we waited about 45 minutes and no one ever arrived. Horrible room experience the services were even worse. I LOVE the Luxor and stay here every year multiple times but most notably for the Super Bowl. I spend a lot of money on the rooms and gambling. I am also not one to complain but really felt you all should be aware of the extremely poor service and experience and lack of care from the staff including the sense of urgency. This took 2:30 hours to get settled in and the problems still remained unresolved.    I don’t know how else to express my displeasure with this trip. Very frustrating.
50,We initially chose our room at Luxor because of the walking distance to the stadium and a low price but the mattresses were AWESOME! There are no refrigerators in the rooms . They charge $25 for a refrigerator.
40,Stayed 3 nights. Check-in night room was not what we reserved. The non-pyramid part of the hotel rooms were not as nice. The deluxe king room in the pyramid were nice rooms. Stayed 3 nights. Staff tried to accommodate not enough rooms.
10,I paid $300 for an overpriced room. I reserved a room in the Pyramid but when I got there was placed in the Tower. I was not offered any accommodations for not getting the room I reserved. My room view was from the side facing a wall. I was separated from my family even though this was a family event which took away from my experience.
40,Friendly personal clean  2 elevators did stop working on a busy weekend. People standing waiting for elevators  many didn’t know how to use the new system after a maintenance person showed use we were showing others how to use. Now one at checking in told anyone how they work. Would have should have been told how will stay again if no resort fees are charged to us Need personal to check people in
20,The room with king size bed was sold out when I got there even thought I called in advance to let them know I was coming.    They put me in what they called a better room that smelled like a chimney from all the cigarettes or marijuana someone must have smoked there. I couldn’t even sleep because of it.    Then I was moved the next day to room that then had a flooded standing shower so I had to shower with my feet under water which I then had to wash in the sink.    And last when they finally sent a person to unclog it they never sent a cleaning person so there was sewage grime on the floor so I couldn’t shower in the morning.    I’m Extremely disappointed and I’m waiting on some type of refund hopefully
10,Do not stay here!!!!    No matter how great the deal it’s not worth the money. Staff was great and will do their best to help you with anything you need. The food is subpar at best with many fast food restaurants serving better and faster.
50,The staff is amazing the rooms are clean the comps can't be beat and the slots are loose! We have stayed here 4 or 5 times and will definitely be back again. It's a great location on the strip too! Totally worth it!!
10,Paid over $630 for one night one person. Was in a bind booked anyway. There was hair and dirt on the floor in the bathroom which is insane for the price paid. Elevators took a long time. Great location however I won’t be staying again.
50,The entire staff was friendly warm and professional .The host was very nice and accommodating. The hotel was clean and fun. The hotel is located right in the middle of Las Vegas which was a great location. we have stayed there many times before and very happy.
50,It is clean. the staff is courtious. The casino floor could use a little more choice of games and the High Limit slots room could be A LOT better. It is one of the only places that I do not like to play in the high limit room
10,no customer service the check in app didn't work properly cleanliness marginal most I've ever paid for a room with refrigerator removed no kleenx no complimentary water layer of dust on the head board paid 5.00 for 16 oz bottle of water in the casino store
10,This hotel is awful and for a couple of hundred dollars more you can have a much better experience in Las Vegas. The hotel is un-kempt and dirty. The staff as extremely un-helpful and don't really want to work there.
30,No food options. Everything is closed down due to COVID- or that is their excuse. You can't get room service (even though if you ever quarantine in a hotel that is how they feed you- so it makes no sense). There are no microwaves or fridges in the rooms. The buffet closes at 3pm because of COVID??? Most of the other restaurants close by 3pm too. The only options are Johnny Rockets $13 hamburgers or $10 slices of pizza.
40,I haven't stayed in the Luxor in over 15 years and was pleasantly surprised by how little it's showing its age. The decor in the rooms was fresh the bedding and linens were excellent the TV was large and the staff was extremely helpful and friendly. The only negatives were the (at times) long wait for an elevator and the long walk from the elevator to the room. (not all the rooms are far from the nearest elevator but ours was on this trip)
10,Husband put 3 one hundred dollar bills in a slot machine in high limits the machine wouldnt let him play nor let him collect. He asked an attendent to give his money back and they claimed they couldnt do anything for him he insisted that they do the right thing and give his money back - check the cameras - whatever needed to be done. After a manager security guard cage guy and a machine tech told him that the money in the slot matched what should be in there - and said there wasnt anything they could do - my husband insisted that they look at the cameras and get someone that would be able to get his money back for him...after waiting awkwardly for almost an hour (none of the people mentioned would tell him anything) not an explanation of what was going on...nothing. Made him feel like they werent even doing anything and he was lying...now we are mad! You are a casino with high tech surveillance....you can see everything! Another manager came down finally and then went over all of the same stuff - the tech telling him that the money and tickets matched what the machine said was in there...he said well the last thing the machine said was entered was a ticket...right? then of there was any money on top of the ticket it would be my husbands right??? Low and behold!!! On top of the ticket was 3 one hundred dollar bills!!!! But now they cant take any money out of the machine because it matches??? What?? they will bring him 300.00 at this point we are like what ever...just get the money and return it. NO APOLOGY NOTHING!!! When we asked for an apology the manager said the best he could do was 25.00 drink vouchers - ALCOHOL IS FREE WHILE GAMBLING - which is what my husband was trying to do before this whole drama!! Very unprofessional!!! The hotel is old and run down most of the machines in high limits are old and have been there for the 20 years that we have been going there...Dont waste your time or money at the LUXOR - there are plenty of nice hotels and casinos in Vegas
10,Waste your time waiting to get to and from your room. Expect at least 5 to 10 minutes and at least one 15-20 minute wait at elevator.    Maintenance took place first thing in morning... Woke up after Wedding Night to the walls shaking as drilling/cutting was happening first thing. Measured db's... Sound coming in room was 80 - 82dbA.... Completely unacceptable. STAY ELSEWHERE!!!!
50,Mobile check in was awesome I didn't have to wait in check in line went straight up to my room. Which was super simple because we got in late. Rooms were clean and accommodated my family perfectly. I also love the restaurant Diablo
50,The LUXOR was a great hotel will totally recommend it. Pulled into the valet and the guys out there were great!!!!!!! We also watched the BLUEMAN GROUP on Friday & that is an AWESOME show!!! This trip didn’t disappoint!!!
30,"Upon arrival there is/was no ""clear"" direction to valet parking one escalator was constantly shutdown in room door frame missing refrigerator missing plug socket plate missing. This resort was average at best."
30,My room was everything I expected just doesn’t have a microwave. Make sure you walk around your room to confirm everything works and is connected to the hall. They had to turn the water off last day of my trip so make sure EVERYTHING WORKS.
30,The smell on my floor from the trash by the elevator was awful and no one did anything about it for days. It was absolutely appalling. It made walking to my room or out of my room completely miserable especially when the smell started to seep into my room. It was terrible and made the experience much less enjoyable.
20,The hotel is dated. Tables are worn out. elevators feel unsafe due to loud noises and clunky operation. The app does not work in the elevator or in the parking garage. The bathrooms were gross and had no paper towels ever
10,The room was clean but outdated the hallway to the room was too dark and not well lit I did not feel safe walking to my room regardless of the time of day. Disappointing stay. They didn’t even provide a bottle of water or coffee maker in the room. For almost $850 for 2 nights I expected more.
30,As said its a beautiful theme but it has not been kept up. Staff are friendly enough but don’t seem excited about the job. Employees just not as friendly as in other resorts. MGM seems to have lost interest in the Luxor
50,Fantastic Location Awesome People and Very Generous Comps! What more could I possibly ask for? I have been coming to this location since the grand opening back in 1993 and it just keeps getting better every time I return... Thank You Very Much For All The Great Times... See you guys again soon...
30,I had no cellular and no wifi in my room. Room 3065.    I am assuming I had no wifi and no cellular in my room. We were in a pool facing room only 3 floors high.    Checked in on Sunday pool was open but did not have time on check in day. We were going to go on Monday but pool was closed. closed onTuesday and Wednesday. I imagine it could be too either save money or short staffed but what about the weekday vacationers?
10,Be careful and aware when you book. As if it's not hard enough to just plan for yourself you have to be aware of what else is going on at Mandalay bay or mgm. During any type of sporting event or concert event attendees apparently get priority over hotel guests regardless of your status in their m life loyalty program. Hotel room and whole facility in general is in shambles. We had fingernail clippings all over the floor of our room on arrival as well as used tissues and red stains all over the bathroom. No one cared to help resolve our situation.

50,The staff was super helpful. Parking was Easy. Room was clean & comfortable. Convenient (walking distance) to the stadium. We decided to give the buffet a try before checking out. Lots of choices for all four of us. Again-staff was pleasant accommodating and efficient.
50,Exceptional from the time I walked in the door everything was wonderful valley service desk manager really were very helpful restaurants with good who was good the drinks we had was great I can't wait to come back again
30,The room keys failed fairly often. Got to ride the elevator a lot more than I wanted which we heard running all night. The room was nice and clean as was the hotel. Staff was friendly. Good value for $$
40,The hotel met our needs and was an overall pleasant experience. The rooms did lack some basic necessities like microwaves or a mini fridge but overall the room(s) suited purpose. Lots to do on property so don’t need to leave the hotel.
50,Clean hotel room was very clean unfortunately smoking is allowed in the Casino but it wasn’t unbearable guess it’s a Vegas thing definitely considering returning in January this hotel is worth the money I spent and the ability to check in one out via cell phone is a major convenience and the digital key tops the cake
30,Beds uncomfortable; pillows were horrible. Elevators were a nightmare. This was our second stay there and this time it was quite a bit dirtier than before. The floor we stayed on reeked of marijuana. During a time of pandemic I would have expected a cleaner hotel. It was quite the opposite.
50,Excellent casino location Egyptian theme room etc. Good dining options so near to Mandalay and Excalibur. Only concern was that my room door didn’t shut completely after maid service; fortunately nothing missing.
10,There was an serious issue with cleanliness! I was not happy with torn sheets dirty sheets dirty blankets dirty bathroom countertop and toilet as well as a clogged shower drain.. the location was good for walking out to the strip
50,Great stay at the Luxor . The daddies at the front desk was very Friendly and the check in was very quickly considering the line was long. Very convenient. the room was very clean and nice. Beautiful views and convenient location
10,My brothers room had bed bugs and so did mine. Stay away from east tower floor 14 my brother was getting married and he had to get married with welts on his face from bed bugs. I had to go to Home Depot to get bug killer and I sprayed the whole room first. Do not lay anything on the ground.
50,The Luxor was the perfect place to stay for easy access to the House of Blues concert we attended! Playing blackjack drinks were readily available. Free tram to other properties was nice. The Public House restaurant near casino floor has a delicious piece of chocolate cake!
20,An ok hotel if you don’t expect much more than a motel 6 room food and drinks are way overpriced for what you get not in a good location to access monorail resort and parking fees on top of room fees not disclosed when reserving room entire hotel seems dated
30,We only received housekeeping services once during our stay. We did contact the appropriate department upon arrival back to our room. They offered to come up and clean the room however who wants to leave the room when your ready to turn in for the evening?
40,Had a wonderful time. Room was clean and spacious and staff was friendly. I did however get stuck in the elevator twice on the 29th floor. The elevator went pitch black for maybe 2-3 minutes and was very unnerving . I used my phone light to find call button and eventually the lights came on and evevator started to move. Also one morning the sink facuet appear to have air in the water lines and spewd air and water for about 5-10 minutes. On a positive note the staff help were very frendily and helpful with the exception of one very grouchy bartender who was very rude. I /we have stayed at the Luxor several times now and overall had a very pleasant experience. I would and have recommended the Luxor to friends and will definitly stay there again.
40,Our family had a very nice stay at the Luxor. The premier queen/king rooms were great. I liked the shower the shower head was awesome and was a great way to help wake you up. Staff throughout the hotel were all very friendly and helpful. We all liked the ease of being able to walk over to the Excalibur too. The monorail is also a great plus. Slot gaming was a lotta fun and there were servers to help get you drinks most of the time. Parking and check-in were all very straight forward and no problem. The elevators can take awhile during busy periods but are okay. Overall staying at the Luxor proved to be a great value relaxing and close to all that we were looking to experience.
30,On the night of my wedding the water was off in the resort. I know I don’t need to go into details why this was a problem but it sure would have been nice to have a working shower and a flushing toilet.
40,Everything was great except food and food prices. Room was clean. Shower is a little weird as there is no door and water goes on the floor making it a hazard. Elevator 2B shook a lot but otherwise everything was good
30,My room had a water spilled in the carpet. We sleep here with a mildew smell all night. Flooded room carpet smell very bad. We had a very bad night I had 3 kids and this just bad. I called 4 times to report
10,The customer service representatives were awful. I was told I was paying for something GUARANTEED. Then when I called I was told there was no such thing (i paid extra directly on the website for “guaranteed early check in”). I was told by all representatives that there is no such thing. I did arrive rather early so I asked if there was any accommodation. They said no so we tried to find a place to wait after being shuffled around and told to leave several open seating areas (like garbage) I went back to the desk. And asked to speak to a supervisor. He was super rude and very sarcastic. He asked for proof of the thing I told him we’re listed on the site AND app and once I showed it to him he continued to be sarcastic and tell me I was lying. I will NEVER EVER EVER come here again.    Disgusting service !!  Can’t even enjoy the rest of my honeymoon or the hotel itself because I’m so aggravated by the service I’ve received before even GETTING A ROOM!
10,Bugs everywhere nightstand was sticky no refrigerator or microwave. It wa sour first time staying there since my wife wanted to stay at the pyramid building. The parking staff at the speaker were friendly
20,When i arrived on Oct.29th my card was charged for my 4 night stay . my check out day was on Tuesday well on Thursday they ran my card again for almost $400.00 and no one has fixed this problem for me yet this is the 2nd time i have came to vegas and has had a billing issue with a MGM property im a M Life Rewards member and im sick of this
50,We love staying at the Luxor. We even brought two other couples with us this time one of which had never been to Vegas and we all enjoyed our stay. Highly recommend very satisfied! Definitely the place to stay when going to Vegas.
20,Worst MGM property I’ve stayed at so far. Unreasonably loud day and night. No fridge to store food or drinks in. Cold room with no control of heat or A/C. Plumbing that screamed at you every-time it was used or a surrounding room used theirs. Not enough blankets or pillows bed didn’t even have a fitted sheet. Best part was the pool.
50,Excellent personal service. Rooms are clean and exceptionally well maintained. Very comfortable stay for 10 nights and reasonably priced. Excellent restaurants. Quality of food is exceptional for the price.
50,My boyfriend and I have been coming to Luxor through MLife rewards for years now. We have a choice between many hotels but Luxor is always our first. They’re pet friendly and have everything you need! Staff is friendly and the place is safe and fun. Lots of noise by the elevators through out the night which is expected but that’s unfortunately where our room was this time
10,At check in they offer me an upgrade I accepted and the upgrade that I received was a dirty room and a far room from entrance (WEST TOWER). Also they charge you 10 dlls per nihht for parking and $18 per night for VALET.
20,Both the room I reserved and the room I was moved to had plumbing issues. The sink in both room did not drain properly. The “upgraded” room we were moved to  did not have soap or a “do not disturb” sign.
10,Terrible stench (cigarettes and Marijuana) in the room. Old fixtures... broken edges in all wooden fixtures. Shower did not catch water... it only had one glass panel so there was water everywhere in the bathroom after taking shower.
30,The carpet outside my door was wet and had a smell to it. They also had a blower outside my room door for the whole five days I was there. No fridge nor microwave in the room. They were short on linen. but they did try the third day.
40,The Luxor in Las Vegas is a nice hotel but I wouldn't call it the best.  The room was clean comfortable and appointed well however the décor is stuck in the past...time to update. Our room was on the first floor near the Sport Book and America's got Talent theater but we never heard a thing and that was very nice.  Overall the Luxor is a good value for the services provided. Their on-line/app for check-in/check-out was very convenient.  The down side would be the cost of dining even the Buffet wasn't a really good deal. But hey it is LAS VEGAS.
10,Resort fees are bs. Even though the hotel was prepaid once you arrive at Luxor thinking the room is paid in full they hit you with surprise fees and idiotic prices for parking and internet fees. The pool is closed the internet isn’t strong enough to check email but you’re still required to pay insane fees.
20,Original room had pubic hairs on bathroom floor and towel. Switcher eventually. Second room was ok until shower backed up. Took 2 hours to get looked at. Improved but not fixed. Not satisfied with room
10,We were there for 7 days and 4 days out of the 7 housekeeping never cleaned our room. When we first checked in the sheets had blood on them. My son in laws AirPods were stolen out of the room. The front desk made excuses. There was a tracker on them and they said they would not look at the address to see if it was an employee. We spent more time at the front desk then we did enjoying our trip.
10,The room was not clean. There was dog poop stain on the carpet. When I ask for an extra pillow and blanket I was given it in a bag and it SMELLED horrible i had to sit it in the hallway 🤢. The elevators were gross. I am really shocked that luxor has gone down that bad on the tower side because the upgrade was awesome. It used to be my favorite affordable hotel. I will never stay there again. And staff is not personable at all just rude.
10,Sheets were dirty towels dirty soap stinks when room was “cleaned” they didn’t replace my hand towels. I also thought I would save some money staying here but they charge an additional $54 a night for a resort fee resort fee tax and parking. So I ended up paying way more than anticipating and they didn’t even take care of my room. I forgot to mention the internet sucks!!!!! Didn’t work at all and I needed it for my business trip.
30,Overall the casino and lobby areas are kept up to look nice.  Requested a corner suite which we got but it was one that had not been remolded so tiles were come off in bathroom none of the exhaust fans worked in fact the one over the soaking tub had burn marks on it.  So I was a little disappointed overall with room. Our dresser and closet which the tv sat upon we're turned sideways to the bed so on the swivel mount you could only see 3/4 of the screen  On either hallway next to use had remolded rooms .humm
30,Hope you don’t mind being hot while you sleep. We had a broken air conditioner they came up to fix. It never worked properly  We did not have any room shampoo/conditioner or lotion until day 3.  I will not return here
50,Great location and clean amenities. Would definitely stay here again! Rooms were large and comfortable. Staff was attentive and casino/restaurants were all well kept. Easy access to the strip and other amenities.
40,Had a convention at Mandalay and this is nice anf close and convenient to walk there. Easy location for ride share. Diablo is a descent restaurant. A lont walk to the tower elevators. Rooms are descent but showing some wear. Hot water came quickly which was nice.
10,Old run down hotel. You actually feel bad about yourself staying there. If only you'd worked harder and been more successful you could have stayed somewhere nice. The staff and service is terrible. Can't recommend this place to anyone. Crappy is a good description.
20,"When riding the pyramid elevators and you ""think"" you felt the jostling you read on the warning sign that wasn't it. It can very well throw you to the floor and pause the elevator for a minute or two."
10,Manager didn’t care that my daughters MacBook was stolen I said you have no cameras in your hallways and the elevator to my floor is in a sketchy location he got upset with me. Luxor makes more money than they can handle replacing the MacBook shouldn’t be a hard thing to do!
50,Staff was welcoming friendly and knowledgeable! Rooms very clean and elevators work quickly and efficiently. Had an absolute wonderful time spending 4 nights here at the Luxor and already plan on returning within two months for more of this experience!
20,I was not happy about my stay I was over charged room was not up to par this that was post to be open was close I never head about my Complaints and concerns at this time I would not tell my friends to stay here
40,Other than the carpet in the room being kind of dirty and the hallway wallpaper falling off the room wasn’t that bad and we only had one issue with one employee that was just probably having a bad day and was being rude for no reason
10,This property needs more than installing used furniture from another property. It took 90 minutes to check in mostly due to not enough staff. Most of the elevators had burned out lights and only one side worked.
10,Elevators often did not respond to card swiped or button presses. At one point we got stuck for a couple of minutes and we're freaking out.    Overall staff was nice enough but the fact that we got stuck in the elevator very much freaked us out. We even talked about it with other guests in the elevator and they all experienced the same thing.
30,Dissatisfied with the appearance of the room upon arrival.. Unclean. Sorry floor and shower... Open bar of soap.. Wrapper on counter... Sink clogged with dirty water... Beds looked like they had been slept in
30,They charge for a refrigerator in the room. The shower was stand in no door so it was cold and water would get all over the bathroom floor when showering. Daily room service which was awesome and lifted my over all rating.
10,My key never work to my room and the elevator didn’t go to my floor so needless to say I spent very little time in the room I either had to walk down three or four flights or walk up three or four fights
50,Rooms were great value the lighting was really dark in the tower rooms but not a deal breaker. I do wish they would warn you before your stay that they will be taking a $200 security deposit. I had 2 rooms under my reservation and they took a $400 security deposit it really cut off my gambling.
10,The room was nasty dirty and we were not able to change rooms. Never saw a housekeeper in 4 days! Check in line was over an hour. Was not able to check in online. Will never stay there again. Could not even take a shower
50,Luxor was very clean and friendly staff. The buffet was great. It is located in a great spot with the beer garden and stadium walk to Allegiant just outside it’s front doors. I will definitely stay here again.
30,The best thing about the Luxor is its proximity to other properties. The hotel is beginning to show its age and the clientele are commensurate with that. Generally the staff was accommodating however one member wouldn't even take the time to return a good morning greeting.
10,I can’t express enuff how disappointed I was with this hotel…from the room service(which there was none) to the quality of the rooms to the amenities..for being the first time staying in Vegas my wife and I were not impressed at all…we gotten better service and quality and amenities in a holiday inn…
20,Not a pleasant stay. TV didn’t work. Smoke alarm going off at 3 in the morning. Valet parking our car was still at the Luxor so we had to pay at the other hotels for parking. The location was great. The food was good. You have to walk a distance to get yo your room.
50,Always a great time at the Luxor! The theme is awesome and fun and the inside is so captivating to look at. It’s always my go to place to stay. I don’t have much else to say but trip advisor won’t let me post a review with less than 200 characters. Luxor: 9/10 trip advisor: 5/10
10,The room was dirty and the check in process was terrible. It is sad to see this hotel go so downhill from when we last stayed here.    If you’re going to go to Vegas steer clear of this hotel. Really dirty rooms.
20,I stayed at the Luxor to attend a conference for work. Room and hallways were dingy. Cell service was non-existent for T-Mobile slightly better with Verizon. I was not able to get usable wi-fi at all in the room which is a problem when traveling for business. If you're in Vegas to hang out in the casino and go to shows then this may be fine but for business I would not recommend this location.
40,My stay at the Luxor was overall a great place. It's was close to the shows I wanted to see. There was a shuttle and taxis made available. My car was safely stored in a parking garage. I was expecting a little more for the room but little things aside it was a great place to stay at.
20,Room was average to below average...could have been same quality as a Motel 6. There was still food in room refrigerator upon my check in. Bathroom was dingy and dirty. Casino and restaurants there were average however Diablos was good. Was not comped what I was promised and will probably never go back...by the way the elevators there were a joke!!!
30,Stayed in the towers room. Bathrooms are not cleaned properly. The tv are outdated no YouTube Netflix option. The buffet is good is you can eat a lot and the cafe is great for breakfast. The spa is good for the hot stone massage the therapist Miel was amazing.the jacuzzi and pool in the spa looked uncleaned so I didn’t go in. Overall it’s an Okay stay
10,"Bell staff do you have any? Then we had trash in room upon arrival. Also shower floods every usage and Front desks response was only ""Yeah we know"" We were never offered a room to move to. Staff has no customer service they only cared about their venue they are working at. Customers are left to fend for themselves to figure out the layout of the hotel and search what is in your hotel. . Bartender tells us your customer at night coffee maker was broken yet the next shift it miraculously worked. Hotel itself is dirty everywhere you look. I get the Casino guests are your big money makers however this customer CHOSE your property and would be the one to suggest your property to future customers. Very disappointed in the Luxor Property"
30,"The sign in the elevator reads in brail ""Hold Room or Digital Key Here Until Light turns Green Then Select Floor.""  How does a blind person exactly see a green light?  This is just one example of many errors in judgement when it comes to management of this property.  Luxor is conflicted between being a hotel or an entertainment venue and is doing neither well."
50,Our visit was comped for 5 nights. Our Marketing Exec Scott made all the arrangements including airport Limo pick up/drop off. It was our 49th Anniversary. Scott left a very nice gift of 'goodies' and a bottle of champagne to help us celebrate.
10,We booked a room at the Luxor and the room was absolutely filthy. There was vomit on the carpet and the counters were covered in sticky/dirty stuff. It was like the room wasn’t even cleaned. Will not be booking here again…
30,Hotel was old. Room had a terrible shower old carpet and an odd odor. The refrigerator had been removed. Casino had too many machines and not enough card games. Elevator was pretty cool though. America’s Got Talent was fun to watch in a good venue.
50,Conference rooms were spacious and comfortable. The hotel rooms were great! The entire hotel was clean and the staff were friendly and very helpful. The cantina had awesome food and the sports bar was open late and had the best burgers.
40,Great stay at a clean hotel with great ambience. Luxor had everything we needed. The staff was very courteous and professional. We enjoyed the food and the accommodations. We'll definitely stay again.
10,The building is old and unsafe. Electric wires was holding an exit sign up. Our room had wholes in the walls that should have had electrical covers on them or something. Whenever I plugged something into a plug there was a spark from the plug “Scary”. Our bathroom door was almost off it’s hinges. Very sad place and will never stay there again.
40,My wife and I currently reside in Las Vegas. We have NEVER stayed at a hotel on the strip and thought we should this time to celebrate our 11 year anniversary. We were informed that this property is a late check in property (it starts at 3pm) so we thought it would be great to check out some of the entertainment on site. We opted to check out the Titanic Exhibit. We arrived at the exhibition at 2:30pm and left 3 hours laters!!! It’s definitely a must to see. We downloaded the MGM Grand app and were able to easily check into our room using the app and were able to avoid the very long check in line down at the casino floor. When we arrived to our room everything looked EXACTLY like the pictures we saw online. The room was spotless and we had a great view as well!!! The bed and pillows were super comfortable (the wife wanted to take the pillows home!!). We felt safe walking around the casino and hotel hallways. For the most part people were wearing their masks which was a bonus for us. Our check in day was 10/31/21 and our check out day was 11/02/2021. We had a great time and look forward to staying there again in the near future.
10,I was promise a renovated room and the room was not what i was promise at the front desk the shower head was to low for me i had to bend over to rinse my hair and that was really uncomfortable for me and the view was horrible
50,Great hotel clean rooms excellent service food in the restaurants was outstanding. I highly recommended the Mexican restaurant and the steakhouse!! The pool area is also very clean and great when in season !!!
50,The Luxor was easy to get to straight from the airport and connected to Excalibur and Mandalay Bay. Great food in the food court and lovely decorations. We stayed most of our vacation and surprisingly want attacked by the time share people.
30,I stayed at this property a couple of years ago and had a very poor experience. Upon learning that the rooms have been updated I decided to give Luxor another chance. While the rooms look nice and the bathrooms are updated the shower does not have a full door resulting in water getting all over the floor. Also my digital key did not work resulting in my having to go to the front desk to get traditional plastic room keys. If you are looking for a place to stay and not spend too much time in the room the Luxor offers a decent value for the money spent.
30,Expected more from Luxor. Name alone implies quality and excellence. Check in by mobile was a good but it's not programmed for more than 1 room. Same long line for 2nd room and more. So defeats the purpose. Long haired gentleman staff member could be more pleasant when answer an inquiry. It as our first time in the hotel so the different elevators and locations were very confusing and overwhelming enough. It's understandable that the staff gets the same questions asked day in and day out but for us guests it's a our first time experience.
50,We drove to Las Vegas from San Antonio with our pet Sugar we normally fly but this time we wanted to take our pet we told her What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas. We got there 1 day early and they were able to put us right into a room we were very pleased with everything about our stay and will be back in May.
30,Generally a good stay. Located at the end of the strip so we avoided the crowds (stayed during Halloween weekend which can be a circus-like atmosphere). Quality quiet clean hotel with a friendly staff. I wish the parking lot was a little closer but I will stay there again.
50,I had the best time at the Luxor. It was my first time in vegas and it ended up being the best vacation ever. My friends had fun the service was exceptional and we’re already planning on going back in 2022
50,Switched from tower to pyramid on the last day I wish we did that much sooner. We got the premium room and had an amazing view the tower room we had originally was outdated and the shower pan w peeling.
20,Not a bad value for your dollar but the property is getting old. Inclinators were a real pain and probably caused more headache for guests than anything else. Parking is not cheap at the hotel. We were not aware it would cost $15 a day to self-park our rental car! YIKES!
10,You get what you pay for. No coffee in rooms minimal soap and shampoo no refrigerator remote didn't work upon arrival. No bellhop service where Uber drops clients off.  They blamed Covid for no coffee? This is just management going cheap. Stay away from this hotel It used to be a good value but not anymore.
30,The Luxor is starting to show its age. The rooms feel like the Super 8 went shopping at IKEA.    Inside the fake buildings over the shows and restaurants are a Mayan pyramid and a Moroccan city? I thought this was Ancient Egyptian themed. It doesn’t make sense.    Pool closed without notice hotel staff did not own the situation or really try to fix the problem by honoring what was already paid at a different resort within MGM. Staff kept saying to email a staff member who wasn’t present that day like that is supposed to help me have a poolside cabana like we’d already scheduled and paid for but can no longer access because how were we supposed to know your pool is only open weekends starting November 1st. The website continued to show weekend and weekday pool hours.
30,I have stayed at the luxury many times. I am sad to see that it is not being kept up or remodeled. When checking in they promoted mobile check in. I am AM life member and had to find my own way into the VIP line.
50,I enjoyed our stay the hotel was great as well as the service. I wish the rooms had refrigerators but definitely satisfied with this hotel and would stay again. The rooms were clean and the hotel was in a decent spot on the strip.
50,as always Luxor was awesome great people working there from the front desk to the drink people Public House was excellent everybody is super friendly also won quite a bit. i reccomend the Luxor to anybody.
50,Great hotel and casino with a great Host (Scott Altman). Scott always makes sure our stays are at least a 10+. I felt safe as always and know that management is doing everything possible in today's environment to keep us as safe as possible. Thank you!
30,"The frustration was the check-in process as there were a huge line snaking around the lobby like a popular Disney Land ride. If a staff member would have ""worked"" the line helping people to check-in using App there would have been happier people."
30,The 'coolness' of the Luxor needs a refresh. My room was dated and simply felt old...carpets paint overall decor. Certainly clean and bed was comfortable but the place needs a refresh. The elevator smelled like sewage every morning (3A) and the shower though high pressure and high volume soaked the bathroom floor unavoidably.
50,It was fun and amazing like it always is we do it every year staff is so very friendly and nice house keeping was good and food court could use a little more choices buffer needs a little more dessert to choice from like it use to be but over all it was a great stay
50,I love this place b/c of the theming alone. The room was average as far as amenities It's bathroom was nice and spacious though seemed newly remodeled. The lady at check in hooked us up and gave us a corner room with jacuzzi :).
50,Great place to stay. We had a wonderful time. The Maid Service was outstanding. They replaced our towels and bed sheets on a daily basis. Our room was always very clean. I highly recommend this hotel. The customer service was excellent.
40,We used mobile check in and it was the best thing EVER! No waiting in those long lines and our room was ready when we arrived. Absolutely will use this form of checking in again. Our room was super clean and very spacious.
50,We go to Las Vegas a few times a year and always stay at the Luxor. It has the atmosphere of a family and the staff is always wonderful. They enjoy their jobs and do everything to make your stay something you will remember.
50,Luxor hotel is an awesome place to stay. Beautiful rooms excellent staff convenient location easy access to all stadiums and the strip. 10 minutes from airport. Very Satisfied! I would and have recommended the Luxor to family and friends.
40,My husband and I recently stayed at Luxor Oct. 2021 the room was very clean and nice. The food was great at Public house. Our only concern is that I forgot my cell phone in our room and we have called lost and found and no one ever answers and have left messages and left emails with no response from anyone. I do realize this is a big hotel and they are short staffed but it would be nice to get some sort of response from someone.
10,"I paid extra for an upgraded room however the room was no nicer than any Red Roof Inn I stayed at 37 years ago when I was a poor student! When I arrived there were no towels in my room and the ""upgraded room"" had a view of a parking lot! Mad me sad to think what the entry level rooms looked like!"
50,Rooms were great food was good attended a conference and felt safe being around other people would stay again machines paid a bit. Shower had enough preasure to take a good hot shower only issue was would have been great if the buffet was open
40,We enjoyed our stay very much. We even got offered a complimentary upgraded room without even asking. The cassino was fun and seemed a lot of guests was winning. It was our first visit...so we got turned around a few times. Staff was always very helpful pointing us in the right direction. I recommend staying at the Luxor and I will be visiting again.
50,My time at the Luxor was great. I booked a tower room and to my surprise by checking in on the MGM app I was able to get into a room at 11:30am I also picked up late checkout for just $30 with 3pm departure. The Tower rooms are the newest rooms on the property and easiest to access. Totally worth the upgrade compare to the pyramid rooms. Tower rooms are very spacious. The pool area depending when you go might be limited to one of four pools but there's seating open in the entire complex if you prefer to do some sunbathing. Overall the property is easier to get around lots of varieties for food from cheap eats to high end eats and easy access to Mandalay Bay for more options too. Access to the rest of the strip is easily accessible via the tram just outside of valet to The Excalibur then off to the pedestrian bridges to NYNY or Tropicana.
10,"This was the worst experience at any hotel in the world literally-in the world. I was charged for two nights when I stayed for one night. The line was 2 hours long and I could not check in until later and was charged as a ""No show/with tax"" and I was charged for a ""late check-out fee/with tax"" after I paid for a late check out when I booked the reservation.  However the worst part was that the manager named Jerkin or Jergen was negligent angry and discriminatory. He was so rude he went out of his way to make it a miserable stay. It took 4 hours to enter my room after receiving my room key because of the key not working wrong directions poor management.  The manager: Jcemani@luxor.com in incapable and obscene."
40,In our room the bed was exceptionally comfortable! The room temperature would not stay where we set it on the thermostat kept reverting to 65 degrees which was a little cool for us. The toilet was acting as if it was partially clogged - would take 2 3 sometimes 4 flushes to complete a cycle - never even approached overflowing - could immediately flush after tank filled. The pool was unexpectedly closed 2 of the days - not sure why.
40,The rooms were great. A two room suite was nothing more than two hotel rooms with a central door to go between the rooms. One of the rooms was was a nice suite in a corner of the tower well furnished. There was also a need for a handicap room. It was one of the best rooms I have been in for a wheelchair bound person. lots of grab bars in the bathroom to help get around and take a shower.
50,I just Love the Luxor. I was in Vegas for a trip and my plans got extended due to flight cancellations. The Luxor accommodated my extended stay and they had nothing to do with my cancelled flights. They took the stress off of me because of the cancelled flights. They made sure all my needs were met.
40,Room was clean and had a decent view from the 20th floor overlooking the pool and mountains. I have stayed at both the Tower and Pyramid in the past and prefer the Tower. Paid for the early check in for $20 and got checked in at 10:30am. Was happy with my stay the only problem was some of the elevators were being worked on when I got there but they got them running by the time I left my room. Would recommend staying at the Luxor and would stay here again.
50,Strictly pleasure trip and Luxor was a great place to stay  Pleasant staff and good location  Good selection of places to dine  Lots of things to do and close to novelty stores  Walking the strip was enjoyable as well as entertaining
50,Stayed @ the Luxor for a short retirement celebration with my wife. The service was outstanding and the folks were super friendly. Entertainment and rooms were first class also. Great location and food.
40,The room was very clean. The check-in experience was very good he looked into meeting all my request. I stayed in a tower premium room and it had comfortable beds but no refrigerator or preloaded refrigerator.
50,Clean and great value overall. They checked me in early and I appreciated it. Stated for one week overall. We watched a couple of shows and the service was quick. This is my third time going to Luxor and I’ll be back again!
40,room was nice..loved the shower. plenty of room. ate at the steakhouse at luxor. the meal was unreal. best steak ever. machine were lose in the morning and mid day. very tight at night..made a little money so cant complain. will be back in 12 days to try it again.
40,Missed refrigerator in room. And was surprised at check out the resort fee everyday. The room was very comfortable and immaculately cleaned. Also was impressed with the services in the hotel. Restaurants and gift shops.
30,Run down in certain areas broken walls dirty trash laying around. Shower didn't drain shower walls were dirty room was dirty left over stuff and trash from previous guest curtains held up by zip ties and no refrigerator as advertised
10,The rooms were hot and our key cards  Did not work the entire time and we had to visit the check in desk multiple times a day. Customer service was awful. They were not friendly or helpful in the least bit. You plan to visit the strip at all this is not the place. It is so far from everything.
10,Wonderful hotel except for the elevators. Most of them don’t work and the ones that do work take way too long. We had to wait 30 minutes every time we went to our room. Guests were pushing and shoving each other to get on the elevators. Will never stay here again.
10,Check in took over an hour. Short staffed. No coffee machine in the room. The directions on how to find the West Tower were not sufficient to find the correct set of elevators. The room was stale and outdated.
50,The hotel isn’t new anymore but it’s clean well staffed and just plain fun. The food was good and the gambling was was too. I never knew losing money would be so fun! I will make a point to stay there again.
50,Had gotten married wonderful weekend could have away from smokers but overall great atmosphere and great venue . Stayed here before and will come back soon. Holloween weekend great time of year saw so many costumes .. Best one was Jesus holding up a angel in front drop off as she was puking had to laugh at that..
20,Checking in was a disaster don’t even bother taking the time to sign up for all of their nonsense it’s a waste and it doesn’t work. I forgot something in my car and they made me pay the $26 dollars to re-vallet my car such a scam! My sink didn’t drain in my room my water turned off in the middle of my shower (turned back on 10-15 min later) and my carpet wasn’t vacuumed upon arrival. It was a great location but I was really disappointed with the overall experience.
10,If you check in on a certain floor that's the only floor The Luxor allows you access.  The bathroom has no shower door water goes all over the floor.  Rooms do not have or offer coffee machine Microwave or refrigerator.
30,Don't expect to get the category of room you actually booked. The East Tower is old and worn out with chipped & cracked tiles in the bathroom. Bare bones room for sure. Service is non-existent after checking in. We did not get maid service even after catching them outside our room at 4:30 pm and asking specifically for the room to be cleaned. Arriving back after a show the room still had not been serviced. Could not reach housekeeping or guest services for clean towels and a pillow. The Luxor has definitely seen better days. Oh and that strict mask policy? Don't expect them to enforce it. At least half the people checking in were not wearing masks. We did see one agent trying to get a man to wear a mask but he refused and they checked him in anyway. If you have a rule it should be enforced!
50,Stayed in a two bedroom elite tower suite (west tower). For what we paid our group would have only gotten two queen rooms at NYNY for the same price. This is my new room of choice on the South Strip. Fridge wet bar and a living and dining room bigger than the ones I have at home. Themed hotels are what make Vegas Vegas. Never will understand all the hate for this place.
50,Great place to stay rooms are great employees are professional and friendly they got great games and restaurants would love to come stay here again it's located right on the strip which is a plus so you can get to all the Vegas fun faster
30,Clean room nice stay. Staff were friendly and courteous. I would stay here again if needed for work. I don’t think I would stay here for leisure. Casino is small but well ventilated. Easy access to Mandalay Bay for conventions.
20,We paid for early check in to stay in the pyramid and no rooms where available. So we had to take a tower room and got charged extra for it. Also 2 of the elevators in the tower where broken and caused alot of waiting time and full elevators. Then there where extremely loud guests slamming doors in the hallway and room service people who would enter our room when we declined room service and when the privacy sign was on our door. On top of all that the entire hallway smelled like marijuana
40,I found this hotel far better than some of the reviews for it. We stayed in an East Tower Room using the AAA rate. I would stay again but not providing coffee makers and refrigerators common in Strip Hotels is inconsiderate of the customer as is the Resort Fee. Price the room and be done with it!
50,Great hotel to stay in. My friends and i had a great time and the cleanliness was exceptional. I would definitely stay here again. I was only able to stay one day but i would like to stay longer on my next trip and try out the pool.
30,My wife and I stayed at the Luxor for a family wedding. The staff was amazing for us. However the rooms had no fans in them for ventilation while your taking a shower. And the ventilation next to the casino was terrible. I ended up getting sick from the lack of ventilation unfortunately.
50,Great hotel. Lots to do. Easy access to Las Vegas Blvd. Restaurants were great. Pool was good. Niki was a great pool server! High energy. Just wished the adult heated side was open. Too many kids running around & in hot tub. We had great experience.
30,it took me over an hour to check in. the staff was not pleasant.there was only 3 clerks at counter and the line was outrageous. they shouldve done better with staff. some staff just stood around and looked at us. was not happy being a pearl member and didnt have other lines for vip service. i even tried to do mobile check in but system was down i guess. there was no one to even assist and walk people throught that.
20,Weak casino poor food choices outdated rooms most elevator buttons don't work at all key to rooms is hard to with including Bluetooth phone app. Wifi is spotty phone service is worse. Walls are thin af and people are loud all night and morning.
10,Reserved a suite for a bride to get dressed in. The “suite” didn’t even have a comfortable chair to sit in. The other room only had a mismatched bar table with 2 mismatched straight back chairs. Horrible!!!! Had to go to Plan B!!
10,One of the worst experiences I've ever had I will never stay here again  just so many things that made my stay here horrible I could go on and on so I'll just say this ....don't stay at the Luxor it is a total waste of your hard earned money
40,The property is huge! I walked a lot to do anything like question a charge or change a room key. However the staff was very accommodating. The rooms are beginning to show their age and I have stayed in cleaner places but I can understand to some degree the reasons why.
30,Not the same place I'm use to there were no pillows available the rooms look dirty and hallways are not well maintained the price does not match the service if it wasn't for the location I would never stay there again
10,Room was filthy when we arrived stale smell hair on the bathroom floor and the air vent caked in dust. No refrigerator in the room and an air conditioning unit that could not get the room below 70. Completely dissatisfied with this hotel I had stayed there 3 years ago and it has severely gone downhill. Never received my $50 resort credit as per the promotion. I will seek other options for my next trip to Vegas
30,for the money the worst bathroom design ever. from a kids toilet that had you sitting on the floor to the dumb ass design of half a shower door that left water all over the floor plus only one place to hang your towels. sorry but the small things mean a lot to us. will look elsewhere next time.
30,Rooms need remodeling not very attractive or appealing to me. No coffee or refrigerator in room. Total inconvenience. Hallway floors dirty. Carpet was dirty and curtains were dusty. No view of las Vegas strip.
10,Room was terrible wet carpet bathroom door didn’t close old food on the fridge and the wirse part we got bite by a bug We had so many bites the firs night I noticed couple on my leg next night my girl on her leg and back
40,Hotel is beautiful. We got the one bedroom suite with views of the strip. Bed softness was a 5/10. Suggestion if you can check in online or become a mgm member gold status minimum because the regular check in line will be at least 20 min plus wait depending on the time you arrive. We tried 3 restaurants in our hotel. At the Cafe they have bottomless mimosa for 20 per person. Their buffet is open until 3 pm. It's a brunch style buffet. Prices are standard on what you'll get at any casino. We also rented out a cabana . Service was good. They would check up on us every 30 minutes. Now for those who never been to vegas. Yes the luxor is at the very end of the strip. From luxor to the Venetian it's a little over 2 miles of walking. Which is the other end of the strip and where luxor is at there's not that many shopping choices besides what's in their hotel and Excalibur (both own by mgm ) you won't hit the strip until you get to New York. New York which is 3 casinos down. Sometimes we would just uber/lyft one way because it's a walk . Another thing due to covid room service wasn't available at our visit hopefully it'll be up and running soon. Since luxor is part of the mgm u can make dinner reservations at any mgm locations.
10,Our room was robbed. Cops said it happens there alot. Hotel did nothing but move us. And then put another poor victim into that room. No cameras and exit doors do not lock or alarm. This place is a joke. Do not stay here!
10,Was not given room reserved as hotel “oversold” rooms so I got stuck. Left hotel without staying. Horrible customer service and long waits on phone from room to try and get corrected. A complete waste of time.
10,The showers have no door. After taking a shower the bathroom  Floor was all wet and there was only  One soap in the bathroom  For hands no body soap. Bath towels feel weird and old and cheap. …………………..
50,My stay was very good and the staff was very helpful. Overall I have a very good stay with he luxor. I will be coming back for future trips and will definitely recommend staying here to all of my friends
30,I understand this is the new normal but disappointed in being charged 10$ to print covid test paperwork. Ridiculous resort fee should cover this non sense. WiFi is atrocious especially by the pool. Otherwise very average. Dated but well maintained.
50,The Luxor definitely stands out on the Las Vegas strip because of its pyramid like shape. I really enjoy coming out of my room and being able to look down on the inside of the hotel/casino area. My room was clean quiet and well maintained. It's location allows me to walk or use the tram system to enjoy the strip without using a vehicle.
40,Not a great variety for eating and most were expensive. Not the best selection of slots and limited table games. Tram to Mandalay Bay/ Excalibur was not working and two out three moving walkways to Excalibur were out of order.
20,We came here because we needed a place to stay for EDC. We knew going into it that it was going to be pricey since it’s a busy weekend. We arrived and no one helped us find our room had to search for someone for 10 minutes. Our room was dirty and the bathroom sink was clogged. The shower and bath tub also had issues.
20,We stayed at the Luxor for a kids baseball tournament. When reservations were initially made I booked 2 rooms and selected that we wanted the mini fridges so we could keep waters and Gatorades cold for the players. Neither room supplied them. I asked twice and was ignored both times. I requested towels numerous times and never received. We used our kids beach towels. I booked two reservations and was charged double the amount for the 2nd room. We knew the hotel was busy so we chose not to have them clean our rooms I did it myself. When we arrived there was hair on the bed and the toilet never really worked. We called about that as well and never saw anybody. They were to credit us back one night of one room and that didn't happen either.
40,Fun weekend. Hotel was accommodating and great value. Will definitely plan to come and stay. Will be able to recommend to friends and family for their weekend vacation or family trip for great Location and value
10,Dirty room. Clothes left by people who previously stayed. Horrible during COVID times. Called Room Service and no one came to pickup clothes. Left clothes outside the room and the clothes were sitting at door until we checked out.
20,Overpriced. Rooms are not all that. Plumbing issues. Sink and bathtub plugged up. Not a very good deal for being a player at the tables for hours and hours. They would not give me any credits towards my stay which most of the Hotel/ Casinos do.
10,The rooms are updated need better customer service the bathrooms smells my friend was missing items went they change her from rooms the lobby employees was very rude to her she never recovered the items and know took responsibility
40,I’d return the Luxor was the first hotel I ever stayed at over 15 years ago. The upgrade was a nice touch along with the no fee resort fee. Come to Luxor for a relaxing get away. Summer is the best time to visit Vegas
50,I almost switched because I paid a lot of money and wanted everything to be up to par the fan was a loud and there was no soap in the room when I got there Donna at the front desk was able to resolve the issue the customer service is the reason I would come back.
30,Hotel dated sheets/towels are rough. Location is good and staff is friendly. Showers could use to be redone. Elevator wait was long some did not work check in line took forever. Only get shampoo and lotion no conditioner.
50,Every other year our family goes to Vegas as a whole group and we always stay at different hotel and by far the Luxor this last month was the best to me. We've stayed at MGM Park MGM and Excalibur and Luxor. Their hospitality friendliness and overall cleanliness of the rooms was better than any others. The Elevator however was kind of a trip at first cause tof the 39 degree angle it goes up but it also makes sense as well.
40,It was a great visit happy we stayed here. The view was even better very quiet in the room no noise was heard from casino or outside. Bed was comfortable and the shower was amazing! We look forward to coming back
50,Have an and amazing time Bars we’re amazing with the DJ playing good music a few nights in a row. If you haven’t been during Halloween you should. The staff was very accommodating funny and friendly. Definitely coming back again.
40,If you are looking to attend the Las Vegas Raiders game this is the resort to get. It was very cost effective had great facilities and good service. Game day was a breeze with the way the city allowed for easy access with a walk to the stadium. I will be back again as I have season tickets to the raiders might just be my new vegas home.
30,Bad service hated it.The room smelled like foul smoke or something. The bed didn't look to clean  trash was on the restroom and bedroom floor plus some used underwear too !!! I couldn't believe it !!! Staff was no we're to be find to fix this problem. I felt tricked into getting this room ! Everything that they said was not true but they took my money for it. I am just tell up and mad.
20,Horrible check in process! Front staff is rude! Had to practically scream to get to talk to a manager. Be aware you have to pay for Valet even if you are staying at their hotel! Rooms are extremely clean and hotel is really clean. Does not smell like smoke which is a plus!
10,I couldn’t believe that I over paid for terrible beds amenities limited to just one little soap and shampoo not even coffee!  Elevators card readers having constant malfunction extra unnecessary charges dirty halls ETC!
40,The hotel itself was amazing. Good quality hotel but it was not close to the items that we went to do wile in Las Vegas. Overall 8.5 out of 10. They say everything is within walking distance but how far do you want to walk. I do have to say that the dining in the hotel was sub standard. We went and ate elsewhere.
10,They charged over $100 for one night of parking! There is nothing mentioned about parking charges let alone this outrages charge. Check in took 2 hours. The checkin line was incredibly long. Although the staff was very nice it is unacceptable to add $100 charge for customer parking.
10,My last 3 stays over 12 months were awful! Each stay the rooms were not clean. 1st stay=a splatter spray of human poop on the wall!!! 2nd stay=blood on sheets. Last stay=mouse feces on the bed. To get to a live person took over 40 minutes and they didn't seem to care at all. Look elsewhere for hassle-free room accommodations!!
20,Unfortunately had a bad experience. We got in late discovered our room had wet carpet. Some kind of leak coming up from the floor since it was not by the air conditioning unit and not by the shower. The next day we spoke with management who offered to pay our parking. He didn’t address the issue though. We found housekeeping ladies who said other rooms have the same issue. They brought up a carpet extractor but the water came back. After leaving we noticed we were charged for the issue. No having to deal with that.
10,I had a horrible experience. The elevators wait time is at times over 15-20 minutes. It’s inconvenient when multiple people get on and having to scan to get to your floor. The elevator ride is nauseating swaying side to side. My rooms were terrible. My first room has blood on the walls and door of the bathroom so I got a room switch and a $50 comp for food or drinks. The 2nd room I was put in the shower was clogged and wouldn’t drain all I was offered was ANOTHER room change which I declined because I was tired of being inconvenienced. The manager said he would comp 2 nights of my 4 night stay which I did not receive. The front desk staff and house keepers were extremely rude. The beds were hard with flimsy thin duvet and not enough pillows or tv channel selection. I would NEVER stay at the Luxor or recommend it!
40,The rooms are spacious and elevator ride is somewhat exciting. People that works there are courteous and exhibit extreme professionalism. Foods at buffet were okay but don’t have much choices place to eat inside the casino. Needs a coffee maker inside the room.
40,Happy people love Vegas smiling faces seen in an elevator ride at elevator 4B some whispering it’s our final destination after shakes/ vibrations felt. It’s hard to sleep due to saggy bed mattress. Easy to find parking spot but hard to exit due to card reader fails to read. Operator helped you to exit. Relates to eagles song Hotel California
10,The room cleaning was horrible 30 minutes on hold valet was slow. Its like they don't care just want your money. The light was out on the desk lamp and it took 3-days to replace. Do yourself a favor and don't stay here
10,This hotel is not what it used to be there were holes on the flooring hallways walls had holes electric futures were loose bathroom shower door was all corroded ad falling apart and trash in the elevator. This was my last trip to the Luxor.
50,Staff was friendly and super helpful during the check in process room was clean and location of hotel was perfect to what we were looking for. Especially being across from allegiant stadium for our tour.
10,Check in was miserable. Was put in horrible pyramid room. Promises were made but not kept. Furniture had tears and carpet was sticky!! DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL! Stay somewhere else to ensure a good Vegas experience
30,I liked the self check in. However the app only worked for us once and we were forced to create new cards. We noticed others having the same issue.    We signed up for the staff to clean our rooms. However they did not clean our room our entire stay. I tried calling for towels but no one picked up after 15 minutes. There's nothing like listening to Carrot Top ads over and over again........    I went downstairs to ask for towels and the guy at the bell desk told me to call the same number I had been on hold with and basically refused to help me any further. I spoke to another staff member who's name I didn't catch who made sure to get ahold of housekeeping for me and had towels sent to my room.    Thank you mystery bell hop on the night shift. You were the best part of our stay at the Luxor! Unfortunately due to our inconveniences and the uncaring nature of the other guy I'm still rating this as an average stay. 😕
30,To many people for one poool when they have 3 or 4 the elevators not working in a good waiting for ove 10 minutes every time it was not clean they have raiders stuff all over not everyone is a fan of the raiders!!!!
40,Fun hotel. Great music. Fantastic exhibits. Not great lines at front desk & Starbucks. Loved the inclinators (not elevators). Titanic exhibit was awesome. Overall I enjoyed it & would come back again.
30,We ran out of toilet paper within 24 hours and we were barely in our room TV remote didn’t work shampoo/conditioner were THE WORST and there were only 2 full size towels. When you call for help The line rings 20 more times before anyone answers and they act like you’re putting them out
50,Very helpful when booking.com canceled our reservations after we were already on the place because they did not want to honor the price we booked for. The Luxor bent over backwards for us and got us a room for a great rate bc we had to pay again out of pocket bc Booking.com would not refund the money in time.
30,No room service pushy sales people elevators don’t work 100% of the time with the system that they have no shower door (water went everywhere /wasting 2 towels extra per shower) and can’t use the app if you used a travel agent system to buy room.
50,Luxor casino and hotel has a very welcoming and entertaining atmosphere I'm very happy that I was able to stay there and I look forward to my next trip the staff were friendly and and very helpful the only thing I don't like is that the food court was not 24 hours so if you came in on a later flight past 10 p.m. you would not be able to get any food without sitting down somewhere other than that had a very wonderful experience.
40,I had a great experience overall but I was disappointed with the $15 per day charge to use the parking garage.  I really like the location and the cleanliness of the room that I stayed in.  The staff was always friendly and courteous.
50,Had a blast playing slots and enjoying the views no issues and the staff are super helpful and always available. The available shows are great getting an Uber or Lyft was simple and riding the free tram to Excalibur and Mandalay Bay is nice !
20,It’s a nice hotel with great artwork around the hotel. With two magnificent museum attractions the body and titanic. The Hotel also have a great variety of restaurants and my Buffys. One area that lacked in see drink severe I know the woman they had was working hard but I feel they need to hire a few more to help response time.
20,I have stayed in the towers before and it was beautiful and luxurious and an amazing time. This time we stayed in the pyramid rooms and it makes me not want to stay there again. There was an outlet with raw wires hanging out of it and no lock on our side of the door. I loved the other rooms and their service so I am not sure why they let the pyramid get so bad.
40,I had issues with express checkin but the room was nice at a good value on the strip. The shower pressure was the best I have ever had in a hotel. The rooms were clean and designed well. I wish there was an elevator closer to my room though.
50,I love this place .. I’ve stayed twice now! It’s beautiful and the staff are friendly. I actually am leaving in the morning and I never left the hotel today. I went through the Titanic exhibit saw Blue Man Group and ate at Diablo’s and then went Am gambled to end my 6 night trip. What a way to relax an enjoy my last night in Vegas!
10,Arrived to food and false eyelashes on surfaces. Switched to a different room (that I had to end up cleaning) with hair in the tub food on the floor and a white powder on two of the glass table tops. I was there with my mother and two children. Was comped resort fee for 2 days. Will not be going back. I will go back to the Aria Ventian or Cosmopolitan.
10,It was filthy wasn't cleaned from previous guest..not vacuumed dirty shower cap hanging in shower hairy bandages under sheets which was totally disgusting..requested a refrigerator and they placed on floor in middle of the room which I fell over coming in door.
20,We come to Las Vegas on average 5x a year we always stay at MGM properties because of the great deals that they offer. However I would just like to note that certain properties are really letting themselves go we love Vegas but we don’t like to see homeless people sleeping in your CASINOS and hallways or outside your entrances. Ice machines on your floors don’t work receptacles that won’t hold a device plugged into them showers that flood. I realize we are all going through some difficult times but these properties need to be maintained. I love the town and I already have 2 trips booked for next year   I’m hoping to that we will see some approvements in the near future.  Thank you
20,Overall for the price not worth it. Rooms were nice but the cleanliness of the carpets and hallways were not great. Everything was so far. My friends stayed in the same hotel and it was a 15 minute walk to their room. The elevators let malfunctioning and no matter how low I put the thermostat in the room it was never cool enough.
40,It was a fun time for my son and I. The only things we didnt like was being sent to the 14th floor of the wrong tower. Once we got in our room very cozy but not a great view. The walk to allegeint stadium was a bit far I have bad knees. The charge for valet was ridiculous cost us 50 bucks just for that
30,The hotel was amazing loved how different it is from the rest. The only thing I found frustrating was the elevator. It would go up but not to my floor. Then it would go all the way down again and then eventually my floor.
40,So just got home from our 3 night stay at the Luxor and it was a great experience for our first time in Vegas! Friendly staff very unique/cool atmosphere with all the Egyptian theme going on. I enjoyed the unlimited free alcoholic drinks and red bulls while.gambling and lots of servers walking around to serve you! Wide variety of slots and table games with reasonable prices and going to the public house is a must. We got the nachos and mushroom burger and was our second favorite meal! Premier kind room was nice and clean bed was comfy only thing I would change is put a tub inside and the shower has a half wall so the bathroom floor easily gets wet and our sink plug wasn't working right but all minor stuff. And inside the pyramid you cant really see out out window due to its tinted windows. It's a bit of a walk for the strip but it's closer than mandalay bay :p. And was a bit shocked at the end of the stay with no complimentary anything after spending a few thousand and getting 15000 tier points but maybe will get something in the mail. But would come back again to either the Luxor or one of the other mgm resorts. Ps. We saved about $250 with the discounts and free play from my konami apps so if planning a trip do download these apps!
40,First time at Luxor stayed there to do Stadium walk to the Raiders game. Everyone was very friendly and helpful. Clean room and good selection of restaurants. Convenient to shops on Mandalay Bay was nice.
10,The staff was incredible and the location was great. The hotel was extremely nice except for the fact that I woke up with little sores all over me. They itch like crazy and idk where else they could have come from. I’m very upset with this.
20,45 mins to check in…water issues…rude staff…compensation not consistent…long lines for mlife…rude dealers…not impressed at all with this place…been to Vegas 11 times n this was by far the worst hotel I’ve stayed at.
30,Luxor is always on everyone’s list to visit however the rooms are outdated and the elevators need some attention. They always stop at floors with no one there. The rooms and hallways do not appear to be very clean
30,Fix your ac room was hot. Bathroom needs to be clean more. Have people stay in the main hotel not the buildings that takes forever to get and far away from the casino. Provide more cleaning items in room so we do have to call guest service and take awhile to bring it to the room
10,the worst hotel and staff by far in the world and i travel i lot i would stay at the motel 6 before i would ever stay at luxor even if the room was free horrible horrible staff and hotel have nothing to offer you but a mask
50,Neetclean spacious and friendly and active staff at service.  Great casino it is very organized and restaurants are really good.  My friends and I personally liked The Buffet at Luxor. It's fresh and it has many varieties of food.
40,First let me start by saying I love this Property! There is so much Luxor has to offer and I always enjoy my stays here.    However this stay was not up to the usual standard and may have swayed my decision to stay there again.    Our room looked as if it was not fully cleaned or prepared for guests before our arrival… We arrived Friday night at 10:30pm.    Here is a list of all the issues with the first room:  -A/C went out  -Tub fixtures were corroded  -One of the queen beds mattress was worn and depressed on one side  -No toiletries  -No wash clothes or hand towels  -Floors we’re not vacuumed  -Glittery oil in the bathtub    Shortly after check-in we called the front desk to have a crib delivered to the room since this was a family trip and there was a 1-year old and at 2:00 AM….(YES 2:00AM!!) housekeeping brought A REFRIGERATOR to us. A REFRIGERATOR!!!! The gentleman went back and got a crib but it did not have a mattress. The crib only had the hard plywood bottom and a sheet over it and we were told that is how they come. No mattress. Just a sheet.    And the cherry on top of this whole first night… the AC went out at some point during the night.    We notified the front desk of all the issues the next morning and was advised cribs should have mattresses (they had to call several people to find out if a crib should have a mattress) and was offered another room and crib. I believe the AC issue was the deciding factor for getting a new room.    The front desk asked us to wait in the (old) room while the new room was prepared. They said it would be ready @ 3.00pm. We did not get into the new room until 5:00pm-ish. The afternoon activities we had planned for the kids were ruined. OUR WHOLE SATURDAY WAS WASTED WAITING FOR THE NEW ROOM! (We only had Saturday to enjoy Vegas as we’re leaving on Sunday)    Additionally the woman who was sent to our room to rectify the crib situation was the only person on staff who was actually mortified about the overall condition of the room and the crib we received. Her English was very limited but she was clearly upset and almost in tears (she may have actually shed a few) that the crib was sent to our room without a mattress. She couldn’t understand why they sent the crib like that. When she was inspecting it she found a used blue latex glove under the sheet.    Eventually we got into the new room which was perfectly clean and equipped with a crib and mattress. It’s unfortunate we only got to enjoy this wonderful room for a short time.
30,This hotel is average at best. No 24 hr. eateries and it is small compared to other hotels on the strip. It served its purpose since most in my party were first timers. It wasnt a bad hotel at all just wasnt what I'd want to return to. The best thing regarding this hotel is its easy access to Mandalay Bay Excalibur and Delano without having to step outside. Oh and it didnt have any shopping stores. Now that sucked!
30,I took my daughter to the Raiders game. The hotel was not well ventilated. The room was extremely noisy at night. The good thing was it was close to the stadium so that was good. I left my AirPods there and didn’t get any help looking for them.
50,Nice hotel. Didn’t really stand out. I could’ve used a complementary refrigerator or microwave. I had an item that came up missing from my room and I believe it was taken by the staff. However I did not report it.  That’s the first time that’s happened to me at a hotel so perhaps I was a little complacent and living things out.
20,The room was not the best. Stained linens. No coffeemaker/refrigerator. No folder to show hotel layout or amenities. No extra blankets. Taxis were not readily available.  Picture in the room had one huge eye looking at you.
50,It was a Great Trip! Great Room Great Location for the game. Good Times! Definitely the place to stay if going to Allegiant Stadium aka The Death Star! Super Close! We had a great time. Staff was nice and friendly.
30,Just the fact a lot of things were broken and no information was presented about this until after. Lack of amenities that could be vital. The fact I had to slam my door shut cause it wouldn’t close easily.
10,noone at checkin mentioned that running water would be off for 6-7 hours that evening into the morning even though they knew about it understaffed at check in agents keep running to the back room. room not clean like the mirage or mgm.
30,Room was ok no iron in room. Digital room key was not working. Lack of variety of table games. Dealers were nice. Housekeeping service was decent. Bathroom door hard to fully close. Looks like just repaired tho
10,The hotel has a terrible slow check in and long lines! Mobile check in does not work! Maid was eating in our room when we arrived! Dirty towels left in the bathroom garbage left in the nightstand drawer crumbs on the sofa and chairs! The tub backed up and the shower exploded with black sewer stuff! The salon did not enforce masks and the stylist in the salon wreaked my hair! No food to be found after midnight! WORST HOTEL EVER! DO NOT EVER STAY AT THE LUXOR!
30,My stay at the Luxor was just ok. Check in process seemed long. The rooms that were originally booked were not available upon check in.  There were three business associates checked in and our rooms were not close to each other. The shower door in the room would not close properly allowing water to collect on the bathroom floor.
50,This was my first trip to Vegas. It was quite enjoyable the only drawback and it was minor was the distance from our room to the elevator. I understand it is just the way the building is designed. We did get turned around a few times on the casino floor trying to find our way to the parking garage.
40,Front desk reception was friendly helpful and knowledgeable. The room was very comfortable. The staff was helpful when needed as sometimes it is difficult to navigate through. I didn't do any shopping or dining at the facility because of my business plans.
50,Was there for a Tradeshow and it was very convenient clean and better than expected. I would stay there again without a doubt. My room was in the first floor so I didn't even have to wait for the elevators.
30,We chose this hotel because it was one of the more affordable options of the nicer hotels and there was an additional sale at the time of booking. The resort fees are a huge pain along with the expensive hotel parking fee ($15 per day for self-parking). Guest rooms have been nicely remodeled but the giant ads on the outside really interfere with the nice view (not to mention it's impossible to take any pictures) and waiting for the elevators can be irritating. The hotel is towards the bottom of the strip but has a stop not to far from either direction on the Deuce bus line which is convenient. It was a nice hotel for our budget but if I wasn't trying to save money I would've definitely considered another hotel.
40,The location and rooms were terrific for the price. Food and portions were lacking and drinks had more than enough ice yet full of flavor. The floors and common areas were well maintained. The Casino was laid out in a reasonable manner when looking for the restaurants.
50,The staff was awesome and very helpful. Extremely patient people. The environment is vegas there's always something going on. If you don't gamble there are exhibits to go to. And if you're a gamer which we are hyper esports arena is pretty cool. You can game or just watch people play.
10,The customer service was totally unprofessional I didn’t get the room I initially booked the rugs smelled of mold and no hot water in my soaking tub I told the hotel manager about it still never fixed it. He was not very professional about the whole situation.
20,Me and my wife have stayed several times at the Luxor over the years and this was a very disappointing trip.From the moment we got to the hotel till we left was not a good experience. We stood in line at check in for over an hour then when our son and fiancé got there it was over two hours just to check in. When we did get checked in we were informed that we would not have water from 11 pm to 7 am that night. When the water was on if you took a shower it pretty much flooded the bathroom from the very extreme water pressure combined with no shower door/curtainthe water pressure was really that high.The a/c in the room was controlled by a motion switch so every time you slept or left the room it would shut off and get real warm. I understand the water being cut off do to repairs or whatever that is beyond your control but the waits to get checked in and a/c issues would really deserve your attention. You have three starbucks coffee stores in your casino and we travel from Texas and we are fairly early risers in the am so that means I'm trying get coffee in the morning and couldn't find one starbucks store open in your casino. might even consider putting coffee pots in the room so your not wandering around at 5 am. Love playing craps and blackjack early in the day but between the 20 dollar min on craps and 1 blackjack table your hard pressed to have much fun there.When I did get on the craps table there were two players smoking weed whilst playing to each his own but i don't smoke weed and don't enjoy being around it that close and believe it is illegal to consume there according to the signage all over your casino.I know time takes it toll and the casino is showing her wear but for the most part the lack of maintenance is an issue broken elevator buttons non functioning walkways and elevator electronic key can be pretty frustrating. The room number we stayed in was 11053 in the pyramid so maybe you could check the water pressure and a/c. Not normally a negative review person trolling the internet to slam a business. But you sent the survey and and I feel obligated to at least be honest if I'm going to comment.
50,I enjoyed my first trip to Vegas and the Luxor. The property and our room was in very good condition. The staff was over the top helpful. Very good value for the money. The location is great if you want a little distance from from the center of the strip. But still just a few minutes by UBER or taxi.
10,The hotel seemed dingy and rundown nothing like I remember it five years ago. The trams were not working the carpet was stained and the customer service at the front desk was horrible. Around 15 years ago the Luxor was considered to be chic and upscale not anymore. I will never stay at this hotel again
30,Room was clean. Not easy to get to and access to elevators were far. You must pay mandatory resort fees and self parking. Also you are not allowed a late checkout unless you pay a fee.. Becareful where you stay as with fees it gets very expensive for a per night average cost.
20,They will give you comp stays but charge you each night once you arrive. They will then realize the mistake then tell you there is nothing they can do about it. You will the get the run around and have to call VIP services who will then defer you back to the front desk who will then defer you to Mlife rewards and the cycle continues
10,When we asked housekeeping for wash cloths for our room we were told requested our room be serviced the bed was not changed floor not vacuumed and the sink glasses ice bucket went completely untouched. I have photos if you need them.
40,Over all very easy to book the rooms I needed for my guys. Only had one hiccup and that was my single king they didn’t have when I checked in. But the front desk guy made everything right by discounting the rooms that I had booked.
10,No running water in hotel for several hours. Elevator did not accept key it took several tries. There was a wet floor sign and cones on carpet for the entirety of our 4 day stay.The Tender c steak house was very expensive but the seats had holes and duck tape on them
50,Room was really spacious for 2 only problem our room didn't have a shower door/curtian to keep the water from splashing onto the floor but not a problem for us. Being up on the 9th floor it was awesome seeing the entire hotel and the sculptures. All the staff members were helpful will definitely be booking here again in the future.
40,The place was busy but the rooms are very quiet. The steakhouse was awesome! And The show that Carrot Top puts on will leave you laughing for days. Also it is an easy walk to the hockey arena to catch a game. I would recommend This place to anyone
20,Our pyramid premier two queen beds room was old whose bathroom doesn't have bathtub nor shower curtain/door. Floor is wet when we take shower. No water boiler in the room to make tea even requested from front desk. Bell Desk staffs didn't know whats going on with the digital key problem (can't use it for elevator) and housekeeping staffs are not knowledgable about the hotel direction.
40,The Luxor was a really cool place to stay! The room was clean quiet and had a great view (we stayed in one of the pyramid rooms). The options for dining and entertainment were great. The only things that were a negative was self-parking (it was a very far walk and had to pay extra for it daily) the walk to the pool was very far and the cost of drinks is very high; but overall it was a great place to stay!
10,After numerous problems and many attempts to get it resolved I was told that I hadn’t done the steps to get it fixed even though I had called front desk multiple times asked staff working on the lobby floor plus spoke to the manager that said it was my fault for not coming sooner when I did. Couldn’t get a compensation for the nights that I didn’t get to use my hotel room cause of these problems
50,For a relatively older casino Luxor is well maintained with updated rooms. Staff was very friendly and the mobile check-in process is terrific (have you ever waited in those check-in lines before!). Casino floor staff was particularly friendly as well. Great location for hockey and football games but a longer walk to the heart of the strip.
30,There is multiple reasons. First off I don't know what the resort fees are charged for when the hotels wifi is horrible secondly they don't offer a shuttle to & from the hotel. I feel if I'm paying $200-$300 per night I shouldn't have to worry about not being able to have decent internet connection. Also the bathroom showers only have the half of glass covering to where water is splashing all onto the floor. I almost slipped trying to get out a couple ties. Rooms should be updated. I was really hoping to have a better experience but I'll say this one was mediocre.
30,So my wife is a diabetic and needs a fridge to keep insulin cold we found out the only rooms with a fridge were the tower elite rooms… so we upgraded it does has a mini fridge fridge no freezer. It also has a coffee pot (the other rooms do not) however we found out that no coffee supplies are stocked… room was just ok spacious but a little dated for a “recently renovated” room. I would stay somewhere else if I come back to Vegas the hotel itself is ok nothing special has a decent casino floor and a couple restaurants shops etc. Nothing you can’t live without seeing. We also had to wait in line almost an hr to check in and our colleagues room didn’t have water for a couple hrs one night. Just not worth the money.
10,Rooms were hot and thermostat automatically turned things back to 70 at certain times of the day. At one point our room was 85 in the middle of the night. Hallways in the Pyramid hotel were always dirty. Key cards in elevator were an absolute hassle. Pyramid Cafe has the worst food if you eat here eat at the Public House. Casino is very small. For the price you pay just stay somewhere else!
10,It was the worst hotel experience of my life. 600 for a first floor room that was so noisy all night I got no sleep. I get up in the morning to find a cockroach in the tiny shower. The bathroom was disgusting and dirty and when I checked out no one even asked how my stay was. I’ve stayed in over 20 hotels in Vegas. This was the worst
50,definitely would recommend. there was self check in using a mobile device which was very convenient because you do not have to wait in any lines. overall the entire hotel was very clean. parking was a little far from the rooms however it is very convenient to access the strip if you decide to drive a car.
10,This was my first stay at the Luxor and my last. One would expect greatness from this historic Pyramid that sits on the Vegas Strip and a MGM property. This property is far from greatness. In fact its like the Motel 6 of properties on the strip. Long check-in lines (And if you a guest you have to stand in that long line just to get a bottle of water because the resort lost water on my last day). I paid a lot of money for a corner suite that was so outdated deteriorating and unclean that I bought sandals from an expensive boutique downstairs becauze the carpet was sticky and dirty. Handprints on the walls trash behind furniture thats visible cracks in the ceiling (that eventually started leaking water on a rainy day 10/25). It was a busy EDC weekend so I decided I wouldn't make them find me a room on a booked weekend with no more rooma left. However the experience here kept getting worse. Phones barely work and do not have correct corresponding codes. Long wait times for calling front desk. Ask for new towels 3 times and eventually gave up. No one came to check leak from ceiling that leaked onto our property I will file a claim for. Asked manager to give me a call and it never happened yet. Save your money and just go stay at Holiday Inn because this was 2 star level property. From poorly maintained elevators to just an overall caotic environment. You have to walk through busy casino just to get to your elevator. Doesn't feel guest friendly. Doors also have no bolt or security latches.
10,Things are broken . Shower leaks water . Get ready to wake up early by staff or to get another room extended u hardly get sleep . AC bearly works . On some rooms . Not a good experience ...elevators don’t work .
10,No wonder the rates were so low.. place is horrible. If you go please get a room in the west or east tower (claim newly renovated looks like a room in motel 6) if not you will be highly disappointed if you get a room in the pyramid.
40,This hotel was ok just had a few small issues but I took care of it other than that it reasonable and fair. I thought they had shutters that picks you up from the airport but the shuttle only goes from one hotel to the other in the surrounding area. Had to Uber to the hotel which was fine. Thought Luxor had there own private shuttle that goes to/ from the airport.
20,Downgraded and disrespected. No accommodations or fixes to the issue and BS reasons as to why this occurred. Could have been fixed with casino credit or food credit. Woman at the counter wasn't willing to assist nor help.
50,I had a great stay everything is clean ready for me my room is cleaned while I was out front desk was courteous and experienced. The casino staff is professional attentive knowledgeable. Dad and I had a great time.
50,This hotel has smoke free rooms which is great. The hotel is clean and everyone who works here is nice and attentive. The hotel is near the bus station in which you can take to travel to the main sites and hotels.
50,Room was clean. Staff was friendly. The online check in was so amazing. I saw people standing in line at the front desk to check in and thought to myself why aren’t those people doing the mobile check in.
10,Would not recommend the Luxor for anyone. Dirty rooms. Staff unhelpful. Not a safe environment. Had to switch my room one time because of how dirty it was. When I went to the second room it was no different. There were people trying to enter my room the 2 nights I was there and there were people asleep in the hallway.
50,Went out to Las Vegas for MJBizCon and booked a stay at the Luxor. When we got there they were sold out of our reserved rooms but they immediately upgraded us to another room. We had a great stay there. Enjoyed the buffet and cabana by the pool as well as the casino floor. Will definitely be back.
30,The hotel itself was great value besides the fact that I was charged twice for parking because I returned my key when I checked out and had to pay to exit the parking structure (because i had to use the card i just returned) only to not be able to get a full refund for the unfair charge. Only half was refunded although they admitted the fault of not making me aware prior to leaving.
10,If you book a specific room don’t count on getting it and don’t count on an upgrade either cuz once they have half your money upfront they don’t care where they put you. It’s either take it or lose it
10,The fire alarm was going for 30 min and then another ten min alarm saying it was resolved they closed the mail room and don’t tell guests so I missed getting a package guest services took 25 min to get a hold of Chris from security hung up on me and check in will take you an hour because the line is always horrendously long
30,Room was fine with the exception of the bathroom. Bathroom always look dingy. Hand towel rack was broken. Shower door looked to have been super glued at the bottom. Not sure what else to say. Other than that cool place
50,"We had a fantastic time at the Luxor. Check in was as simple as going to kiosk and picking up key we didn't even have to talk to anybody! The room was clean and fresh the staff was the most friendly I have experienced in Vegas. Mlif rewards desk had very helpful employees as well as the casino floor they were super nice and engaging. We stayed in the premium rooms not the pyramid and were blown away at how much better then expected they were for a ""budget"" Vegas hotel. I would stay here again in an instant. Especially with the free MLife rewards comped rooms you can earn. Excellent stay"
30,Did not get the room I booked in the pyramid instead got “upgraded” but the room did NOT feel like an upgrade. I was supposed to be staying in the pyramid but instead they put me in the west tower. The TV in the room did not work and they bathroom was dirty. Any time I tried to call with an issue I was put on hold for 30+ minutes.
40,We stayed in a Premier Queen room. These have been updated and are very nice. Only disappointment was there is only one pool open during the week but the weather was a bit cooler so we only spent one day at the pool.
50,The Luxor is close to the airport and the stadium and they have a really fun Beer Garden for games. It was easy to hail a cab or Uber and very close to the bus stop. The janitorial staff keeps the grounds clean.
10,Someone came into our room (we asked for no room service and had the tag on the door) to leave a pizza advertisement and when i called to ask why they said that it was a third party and that they shouldn’t have access to the floors! VERY disturbing to hear. I asked how they were able to get to the floors (because you have to scan your room key in the elevator to get anywhere) or where security was to stop this from happening and got no response!  Also the elevator completely dropped and threw everyone that was in there to the opposite wall! It didn’t let us out until 5/10 minutes later! On the second floor!  There also seemed to be black mold growing in our bathroom. Alongside a massive amount of hair and makeup/dirt on the wall/door.  How ridiculous is it to want to stay in a nice place when you pay good money to be there!
40,We picked the Luxor for our one night stay because we stayed there on our wedding night four years ago. We enjoyed our stay especially the Tinder Steak House best steak I have ever eaten. The room was ok it was noisy and no in room fridge.
30,Really nice room hotel was a great shape considering the age. You should check in online with the app. Otherwise long lines in the evening. I did have a problem with a slot supervisor who I felt was unwilling to correct a very minor issue.
40,The luxor was a great hotel didn't gamble but did love the atmosphere and the staff was amazing only down fall is the distance it is from the center strip but as long as you are prepared for that this is a great place to stay
10,No heat in my room and the hotel staff didn’t care at all just threw a extra blanket at me and told me to basically deal with it. Was freezing my entire stay. No fridge and was never told I had to rent a fridge for a daily fee. So I couldn’t keep food or drinks.
20,Septic gas and bad drains in bathroom  When tub drained the shower drain regurgitated septic smelling water with black chunks in it with a terrible smell septic gas filled the bathroom air always but was worst when using tub
20,The review is for the coroner queen suites - it's large but the space is poorly used/furnished. The furnishings are old and the lights inside are dim (yellow) compared to our friends regular room that's well lit with bright white lights. The sofa could have been a sofa bed for someone to sleep on. The shower water pressure wasn't too strong.
50,Me and my wife stayed 2 nights. Awesome service overall especially the housekeeping ladies. Me and my wife would definitely stay again. One issue that we did have was using the key on elevator sometimes it didn’t work.
20,Military are not held to a quality standard. We were supposed to be upgraded to Pearl status and none of the perks made our stay any better. The hotel needs updating and the housekeeping staff are not responsive to the needs of hotel guests.
30,The Luxor has a nice room for the price. Got the premium room and liked the giant tub. If you get vertigo easily I would not recommend staying at The Luxor. Kind of convenient to the strip but not easy to get to most of the fun part of the strip.
30,Unexpected $200 deposit  $15 everyday parking flat rate.  No microwave or fridge.  Poor cleaning.  Poor circulation in the rooms smelt like mildew.  “no smoking policy” was a bust. Next door people were smoking so it came into our room. The cigarette smell and humid air wasn’t a great mixture.  Try to contact front desk but they’re too busy with check ins so it kept ringing.  Wish we could’ve done better in our stay and the money we spent.
20,Needs updated and taken care of. Ripped wall paper rooms smell very dirty and dark. Not welcoming at all but the staff tries to take care of you but building is in desperate need of repair. Drunk people robberies fights and of course don’t forget about the police visits daily.
20,At over $ 330 per night at least there should be a fridge. Called when we got back home but there was no credit offered or even an apology.  Staff was very nice and helpful though  Bed was very uncomfortable too.
20,This room was not worth the $200/night they charged after all their fees. Was equivalent to Motel 6. There was soda stains on the window seal. There was no coffee pot fridge or microwave. The air conditioning fan made noise. Couldn't connect anything to the HDMI. Asked for a do not disturb sign and was bothered by their cleaning staff twice. Woke up at 6 am to what sounded like someone drilling something into the wall. Their staff was nice other than that wouldnt recommend for the price.
10,When asked where to get food on the casino floor after 12 I had a staff said I don't know man it's late and laughed to a co-worker. I walked to mandolin Bay where I had a very nice lady show me to a subway and gave other options. Overall I felt like the staff did not care and was annoyed about my question about food at night.
20,Good location but that's about it. The food was expensive for lousy food. The majority of employees were courteous and willing to assist. Problem solving was not their best assets. Parking control was a mess. Each and every time I exited the parking facility I needed to contact security to open the gates. The control cards issued to us (synchronized with parking and room key) was totally useless. Our beds were as lumpy as pre-mashed potatoes! We used maid service only once and they couldn't even get that correct. Hair was left in the sink and countertop which wasn't there to begin with. Oh yeah there was dirt and other rubbish left behind under the sink. Horrible! The property must be getting ready to sell or teardown. Let's not mention how dirty the elevators were. Only good thing I saw was maintenance personnel buffing the check-in area.
20,Room appeared to be cleaned because the beds were made but found used sanitary pad (fell to the floor) unidentified pill and dirty floor. I have pictures and showed the cleaning team member the following morning because we checked in really late (2:30am) due to bad weather encountered.
50,This is one of the best hotels to visit while in Vegas. The rooms are nice and affordable. The only thing I would suggest is a tv/and or microwave in the rooms preferable a microwave. I had a great time and enjoyed my staff.
10,The room set up was ok except theee was no fridge no coffee pot  shower water pressure was crap. There was no view of the anything outside except a wall. The digital key wouldn’t work on the elevator. Staff help with the digital key was crap. Staff help with getting receipt was terrible
10,After getting my room key during check-in I went up to my room took out my laptop to charge it. I reached in between the night stand and the bed and found a used condom. I was completely disgusted!!! I gathered all of my things and went to the front desk. I informed the manager but after speaking with him I was left with the impression that this kind of thing happens all of the time. I WILL NEVER RECOMMEND THIS HOTEL TO ANYONE!
10,Dirty. Trash everywhere. Hallway to our room was littered with huge bags containing dirty linens. The bags were there for almost an entire day and night. Mattress springs could be felt through mattress pad. No body wash.
40,Good service. Clean room. Did have issues with not enough linens when we checked in which was rectified by housekeeping as soon as we called. Overall solid choice to stay. Much is left to be desired from the view of the inside of the hotel/casino unless you are on the top 10 floors. The bottom floors are obstructed by exhibits.
30,"When we got here we were guided to someone who could ""take care of us"" but it was someone trying to get us to go to a time share presentation. Instead of being inviting and helpful we were shoved towards someone who only wanted our money - and she became very impatient once we told her we weren't interested. We did the mobile check-in and that process was very easy - and we got to check in early.    We're staying on the 21st floor and the carpet outside our room is all bunched up. I tripped coming into the room. Once inside the room we were a bit underwhelmed. It's okay - everything was clean but aging. The fan in the bathroom doesn't work our TV in the bedroom part of the suite didn't work for the first 2 days and we had to call 3 times to get it fixed.    Dinner the first night at Tender - amazing! Staff was very friendly and efficient. The food was excellent. It was busy due to the Raiders game but it was a good experience.    Breakfast at the Pyramid Cafe was not so great. The food wasn't very good - lacked seasoning toast was served unbuttered and cold omelet had no flavor except for the jalapenos that weren't supposed to be there. Our busser was very friendly and responsive. Our server not so much. She didn't check in with us at all after our food was delivered and we had to ask for our check.    Dinner at the Diablo Cantina was also underwhelming. Staff was very friendly and efficient but the food lacked seasoning and our server was over worked - she only had a chance to run by and ask if we were ok after someone else brought our food out. It took quite a while to get our check.    Overall I wouldn't bother staying here again - but it was an experience."
30,Room smells bad and the bed not comfortable to sleep. Also there’s a hole damage in one of the door dresser . Very friendly and professional from checking in and checking out . Pools are amazing. Nice gym with all the weights that I need is big plus to me. Most likely I’ll stay here again and hoping to get a better clean room
20,While maybe the coolest looking hotel in Vegas from the outside the inside looks like it hasn't been updated in 30 years. Nothing special at all and there were dirty towels in a drawer in our room when we checked in. However staff was very friendly and great location if you're going to a Raiders game.
40,Front Desk staff provided great customer service. fast check in. Housekeeping staff was very helpful and accommodating. Stayed on 7th floor in pyramid. Only issue was elevator was slow. Short walk to Allegiant stadium.
50,Enjoyed my stay the staff thought out the Luxor were very polite and friendly and helpful I also enjoyed that the raiders staduim was within walking distance as well as t mobile area a also the breakfast was excellent along with the staff there
50,I enjoyed my week long vacation at the Luxor. The hotel offered a variety of attractions as well as a box office to purchase tickets for shows at other MGM properties. I enjoyed my vacation and plan to return in the near future.
30,The property itself can sell the rooms and experience its the staff and how you are treated that can make it a memorable experience. overall the service was great but uneven. physical property was OK.
20,Room in need of updating no coffee pots or fridges .Pool didn’t have enough chairs and it was off season.Snack bar was not open only thing open was the bar . Restaurants over priced 20 dollars a day for a wheel chair definitely a money grab making up for covid shut down
30,Nothing exceptional. Had a two bedroom suite. No coffee in the room but there was a coffee maker mold in the shower vanity mirror did not work no masks provided even though there was a paper in the room saying that there were some provided in the room.
50,Was in town for our annual conference. Facilities were awesome and the amenities that went along with it. Restaurants on site provided a great place to get together to rebuild friendships and camaraderie! Look forward to next year!
40,Thr Luxor was stress-free place to stay. The check in and check out were super easy. (Can do from your phone) When I did talk to stay they were friendly and helped out with my parking pass. The building is getting dated but still fun to stay in a pyramid.
50,Location is nice easy to get around Vegas casino is nice and staff are all nice and provide great service. The check in was easy even though masks are required and enforced they don't yell at you in between sips of a drink like other casinos. Over all it was a great experience.
10,No room service. We weren’t warned at check in.    Not a huge deal until you get back to your room at 3am drunk out of your mind and find everything is closed and Uber eats is quoting you an hour and a half delivery.    The reason given was “due to the covid pandemic” meanwhile no capacity constraints on the casino / hotel people smoking in the hallways and lobby. And general apathy towards the masks by most people.    Just felt like a cop out excuse and was frustrating when you’re paying $700/night for a suite.
20,The outside looks cool but the interior and the rooms are so old it looks like nothings been cleaned in years. The inclinators shake so bad you thinks they will fall our overall not a good experience.
30,The pyramid rooms are very outdated but the tower rooms are extremely nice which confused me because I paid $600 more than my friend who stayed in the towers. So why did I pay more for outdated rooms.
10,This place was the worst hotel I swear everything is all dated and the rooms are so tiny. You have to buy a fridge for an extra charge and the tv only has shows that are all lame plus the tv is tiny like they are on a budget
20,The interior could use an update as very little seems to have been done in recent years. The food court is disappointing and the theater is barely adequate. The self parking lot connects to the property through an open air walkway. The staff is helpful.
50,The Luxor has everything you could want from the pool spa hair & nail salon and complete exercise room the different types of dining  the shops night clubs and ways to gamble! The rooms are awesome right down to the suites!
10,"We went to Vegas to see Lady Gaga. Our flight was delayed and were getting late for the concert. For that reason we did a self-check-in in the lobby area because the line was too long to wait. I guess for that reason the automated system assigned whatever room it chose. Let me begin with the entrance to the hotel. The moment we walked in and headed to the stairs there was some trash on the floor dirty papers that looked kind of like toilet paper. The carpet all over the hotel was not taken care of dirty and not maintained. So for the cleanliness I would rate it 3/10. When we got to our room it was freezing in there. We set up the A/C to a higher temperature so that by the time we come back after the concert it is warm in the room. The room was okay. When we opened the curtains we realize that there was no view whatsoever. Our room was facing a very tall and ugly building and everything looked very disappointing. The shower had only one door so when you take a shower the water spills outside no matter how careful you are. It was clearly missing a second glass door.  When we came back to the hotel after the concert we realize that instead of a blanket there were 3 flat sheets. That`s all. And it was still chilly inside the room. When we called the concierge there was no answer for more than 20 minutes. Then we called the maintenance and asked if they can provide us with some blankets. Lady over the phone was rude and simply said ""yes"" and then hung up the phone. Approximately an hour later we got blankets delivered to our room.  Once the A/C picked the room temperature we set it up for we decided to turn it off. However it did not work. Once it was turned off it started blowing cold air and there was nothing we could do to make it stop. It was broken. It was the middle of the night so we decided to wait until morning. I woke up with a sore throat because it was still chilly in the room and the air was blowing right in my face for most of the night.  The next morning the first thing we did was to request a room change. The lady at the front desk was very nice and understanding. She assigned a room for us in the West Tower. We moved to another room which was better than the previous one but not the best either. There were no hand towels or washcloths only 4 bath towels. The shower door frame was hideous with chipped paint on it. Again no blanket. Just the flat sheets. Luckily the A/C was working so it was warm in the room.  We also went to the buffet downstairs for breakfast. The food was greasy fruits were not too fresh strawberries were almost ripened and the coffee tasted almost like water with a coffee flavor. And we had to spend $65 for the two of us.  Overall I honestly do not feel happy about spending almost $1k for the 2 cold and uncomfortable nights and such a disappointing experience. When we addressed our issues when checking out no one even bothered to offer us some discount or at least to apologize for such inconvenience. For those reasons I am rating ""0"" - how likely I would recommend Luxor to a friend or colleague. It would be embarrassing to recommend it.  It was very sad to see that this hotel which has so much potential is not being maintained and managed properly in my opinion. I hope that the administration will take certain actions to fix those issues. Unfortunately but we are not coming back again."
50,Overall good value for the money  Nice location  Clean and comfortable room  Friendly staff  I recommend the Wellness Premier King room aromatherapy smell purified air filter in room and aromatherapy shower head very relaxing
50,I got stranded in Vegas due to the Southwest airlines issues. I had been at the MGM Grande for a work conference but there was a big electronic music concert in town and room rates had shot up amazingly and this obviously was last minute since I didn't know my flight was cancelled until the evening. So I found a room at Luxor still reasonably priced. I got a nice upgrade and the bed was comfortable the room was nice and clean and it was a good experience. Further it was close to the airport in the morning.
40,Much better stay this time than in 2019. Rooms are being remodeled. Great food and service in Cafe and in Buffet. Digital check in and check out is great; some issues with digital key cards working in elevator. Would stay again.
20,They always say you don't get a second chance to make a first impression. If that is the case then this hotel has failed miserably. Check in lines winding all the way through the lobby and only two people on the desk. Several people wandering back and for accessing the situation-but no one doing anything to actually resolve it.
10,The Luxor is dirty smelly and outdated. We were here for a kids sports event and the team stayed here so we had to otherwise I would never come here. The staff is great and super helpful but they can’t make up for how gross and outdated this place is. You should not pay more than $57 a night to stay here.
20,Gave away my room after I reserved it at least 2 weeks ahead of time and of course they make you pay a deposit which is the first night and the room I got was a downgrade but they had no issues charging me the same
50,It was good I enjoyed the time here all the staff and workers there are so friendly and helpful I will considerate you on my next visits here in Vegas thank you so much for everything was good experience
50,It was worth the money would come back in the future nice and quest heard bad things about the Luxor but I enjoyed my visit I highly recommend especially if you just need a place to sleep and shower was perfect
20,Came here with my boyfriend to celebrate our anniversary and I was disappointed on the room we waited until 4:30 for my room to be ready once I got to my room found crumbs on the floor hair in the bathroom and dirty towels. With covid going on I felt they don’t take serious the cleaning . I saw a maid and asked for new towels and new bed sheets and pillow cases in case the bed wasn’t changed I’m just disappointed on this experience
10,Paid for a upgraded suite had no fridge or microwave!? How do you pay so much for a room to not have the basic things?Only half of the pool was open. Water was shut off for a half hour. definitely not worth the money!
20,Shower randomly ran water throughout trip. And tv would lose connection for hours. I called Housekeeping and they said they would send people up and they never showed up. Room was clean but lacked a face towel
30,"Service was minimal and impersonal. The only other place I've stayed at in Vegas is the M resort. Way better. Stay at Luxor first so you appreciate the next hotel you stay in even more. My new phrase is ""at least it isn't the Luxor."""
20,The Rooms had old amenities and in bad conditions also smelled bad no good experience over all..........................................................................................................
10,My friend and I wanted to go to Vegas for a night because we had Lady Gaga tickets. It was EDC weekend so not everything was available. We also wanted to be relatively close to the Park MGM so we could walk. We regretted not just staying somewhere else and getting a cab to the show. The pool area was not nice. It was an ordeal just trying to get a coffee anywhere. The rooms didn't have basic items like blowdryers or hand towels. The bed didn't even have a fitted sheet. It seemed like everything at the hotel was harder than it needed to be. I would NOT stay here again.
20,Tedious check in process drab room furnishings with bad mattress woken by construction two mornings no readily available hotel shuttle (I was told you need to call 24 hours in advance which seemed odd for hotel of this size when 24-7 airport shuttles run at other smaller hotel chains)
20,Room was dirty. Hair all over bathroom. No refrigerator or microwave. Outdated. This was suppose to be an upgrade staff took my tip for upgrading but room was horrible. Sheets full of stains.Pool closes at 6 and there are no umbrellas to block sun unless you pay an additional 50 dollars.
20,The walk from the top parking level should have better access for older and disabled individuals like a flat escalator. It is a very long walk from the parking area to the registration desk. The registration person was great!!
50,Special shout-out to Luxor again for making my life wonderful when i first arrived may we see each other again. Thanks to the wonderful worker keeping it an whole and up to par very outstanding work everywhere you go you seen a worker i love it
50,It’s very big  but definitely a good hotel  clean sheets towels clean bathrooms big queen bad  3 people fit easily lol .  All the places in the food court around $14 min  but base price for all hotel.  The location it’s amazing. self parking 15 per day .
30,The rooms need an upgrade and so does the hallways of the hotel. Some of the restaurants that were located in the hotel were not open which was a bummer. But overall it was on okay. Wouldn't recommend if you are looking for a 5 start experience.
50,The Luxor made our stay special. We traveled to Las Vegas for our wedding and honeymoon. The service was excellent and so was the atmosphere. They even upgraded our room to a suite and gave us a good credit
30,Like I said with me being a pearl member I thought I would have got more perks or some different types of comps games food and I didn't but I was offered them to me at a different and life of property which I didn't take because I stayed with you guys
10,So disappointed when we checked in room was dirty carpet and tile was also dirty. Mold in the shower. WIFI was horrible so that then meant tv was horrible. Bedding was ripped and no coffee maker in room
30,The hotel was nice  The food was really good  Ac didn't work properly in my room  Parking for guests was extremely overpriced and the tram between hotels was down all week and the moving sidewalks between hotels was broken most of the week
50,This hotel continues to provide great service every time I go to Vegas. In the 2 times in 2021 they have continued to exceed expectations with clean rooms and service plus quick check in/checkout options while dealing with large quantities of people. When am in Vegas and have the option this will continue to be my hotel of choice.
50,I was shocked at how safe I felt exploring the different properties and casinos. The experience overall was fantastic and I will be returning. Thank you for taking care of me and allowing me to have an awesome vacation!
20,Custermer service poor. Suite wasn’t what I thought. Asked for late checkout wanted to charge 120 dollars for and hour. Greedy floor servers. No help from front desk when I went there. Manager was supposed to get back to me and never did
10,You get what you pay for. If traveling on the cheap and you don’t mind the lack of service and old worn out rooms this is your place to stay. Not your luxury Vegas hotel. Make sure you use mobile check in but pack your patience because your mobile key might not work half the time.
40,Room was nice. Housekeeping was great.  There needs to be more food options and they need to stay open later. Mobile check-in was confusinglink didn't work. Check line way to long when more people could working the counter.
20,"First night: got knock at door at 11pm after we had just fallen asleep then a walk in from an employee claiming that we had called with a bathroom problem. We never called.    3rd night: we were woken by loud noises that later about 15 min.    4th night: we couldn't get to sleep until 11pm due to bass thumping from the Hyperx sports place. Then at 2:45 am we were startled awake by what was either a jackhammer or hammer drill that was louder than went alarm clock and sounded like it was in the next room. Front desk claimed they were working on pipes and we would have to move rooms.  We refunded ""resort fee""and got a late checkout.    We rented a cabana on our first day that had not been cleaned from the previous day and the area smelled like sewage."
50,This was our second stay at the Luxor and everything was great. The rate is very reasonable and I love mobile check in thru the app and being able to bypass the line. Any staff encountered was friendly and courteous. All in all it was a great experience.
10,My 3 year old slipped and busted her head due to the poor renovations in the bathroom. The showers allow water to get all over the floor. It took 3 towels to soak up the water. They aren’t accommodating. First time at Luxor. I really expected more.
40,Had a great time at the Luxor for my 40th Birthday. This was the first time in Vegas for my wife and I. We had a great experience at the Luxor and the Fantasy show was an amazing experience. All the staff were very friendly and always helpful.
40,Had a great time at the Luxor for my 40th Birthday. This was the first time in Vegas for my wife and I. We had a great experience at the Luxor and the Fantasy show was an amazing experience. All the staff were very friendly and always helpful.
10,Not worth what they charge.  Check in is a nightmare. There is so much water damage in this hotel it's horrifying. The water pipes are in horrible shape and the detergent gave me an awful rash! I am very conservative with my 1 star reviews so I don't give them such a bad review lightly. It was just awful.
10,Will not ever come back to the hotel! Got charged for things we never used wasn’t able to redeem my free play was charged for velet when we used self park! You were sold out everyday for breakfast buffet
10,Only 2 pillows on each bed broken shower door broken hardware in the bathroom no one came to drop off extra pillows and towel after requesting twice. The AC also didn't work properly for half of the stay.
50,Chose this hotel because my AC in my room at the Hilton Garden Inn didn’t work and they would not accommodate any changes. Very happy I switched! Luxor staff was friendly and helpful the entire time.
50,the hotel was so simple to check in and out no lines nice room- excellent stay- you don’t have to deal with any staff it was nice and relaxing i liked the hotel connects to mandalay bay and excalibur excellent stay
20,No fridge in room- Check  No alcohol delivery to room- Check  Broken elevators that leave you stuck inside- Check    This place has it all. Only friendly part was the Valet guys outside. I’ll be back just to park and visit with those guys. That’s about it.
10,horrible stay. was booked for the pyramid but was moved to the tower and rooms were bad. whole stay was very unaccommodating. the whole place smelled like weed and the rooms were not clean and missing stuff in the room.
50,This is the first vacation i have taken in a couple years. Thank you luxor and staff for making it worth it. I will be back next year for my next vacation. And i think I'm going to make this an annual trip.
30,Escalator frequently not working .  The tram connected to Luxor was not in service .it was vandalized.  Long walks to get stores etc. Staff was nice . Room was dusty ..on top of Bedboard . But I would probably come back because staying there I am familiar with getting around .  Bed was comfortable and water pressure was great in shower. But the cut out shower glass made such a big mess everytime you take a shower
50,All the staff and I mean ALL the staff was very friendly very helpful and very respectful. They made us feel like we were a visiting family member from out of town. They all were awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!
30,Overall it was an okay stay. We booked the stay well room due to reviews but personally was very disappointed.  The room was small and smell like medicine. The regular room was much nicer but it was dry air.
10,This place is filthy the staff is not friendly nor knowledgeable of the facility they work on. The rooms are dirty dried paint on things furniture tarnished sheets stained the list goes on and on.
40,Been staying here over 20 years. Clean and comfortable with reasonable prices. Good location. The Backstage Deli offers good quick food. Easy access to other strip properties. Seen the Fantasy show several times always enjoy it.
50,We keep returning to the Luxor because we are treated very well. However it would be so much nicer if we had a way to make coffee in the rooms. There are three Starbucks on property so I assume this is why.
40,Even though its not considered a top tier property in the MGM line up its still a great place to stay for the price. Much better than Excalibur which is the lowest in the line up. Would be nice if they could fix their moving walkways and get the tram working so its not as much effort to get to the rest of Las Vegas If your going to a game at Allegiant stadium it's absolutely the best location and value.
30,Very friendly workers and rooms very clean. Does need some updating. Showers in the rooms are aweful though. Showers either had little water pressure with old time shower heads that just hang and no lining in the tubs so very easy to slip.
20,This is my first ever bad review which says a lot. Not very clean. Hair in my bed and shower. Bathroom sink drained slow. Television blurry with black spots. Felt itchy in bed. Front desk tried to make me checkout early although I paid for late checkout. No amenities. No fridge no microwave no coffee nothing. Worse than a motel  6.
20,First room was very smoked-filled (pyramid) second room was (tower facing roof top with no view) unwashed glasses smoked-filled again floors not cleaned dirty corners rough and soured towels poorly draining tub and sink.
40,We stayed in a tower room. It was nice and clean. I wish there were more late night food options but I’m a night owl. If you can walk a lot it’s a great option. You’re connected to Excalibur so that makes getting further up the strip pretty easy.
50,My parents had a great stay! Would definetly stay here again! Rooms were cleaned thank you to the housekeeping team and thank you to all the workers we really appreciate all of your time and help during our travels :)
50,Stayed at the Luxor and it was very nice. Rooms were clean looked very nice. Loved the bathtub! We would stay here again! There's always more to see in Las Vegas so this will be our hotel for sure!!!!
50,It was a good time all around. it was our first trip to Vegas. We would stay here again. They remodeled towers hopefully pyramid rooms are done by our next trip. You can actually win on the slots here. We won here more than the other places.
20,No heat in the rooms as the janitor said the furnace to the entire hotel was shut off. It was single digits at night so it was freezing.  Loudest screeching toilet that was impossible to sleep through.  Could quite easily hear noise from other rooms.  No fridge or mini-bar.  Extremely limited in-hotel dining options.
10,While some consideration is given for covid measures this hotel would get a zero from me based on service cleanliness and decor. Last upgrade was in 2009 and it was done on a dime then. The staff doesn’t care about the cleanliness of the rooms (or ours didn’t) and we had to request towels pillows and a hair dryer. No soap was left for simple hand washing.  It seems that LV has “opened” and surprised this hotel in its capacity and the management forgot to bring back all of the people to make this a memorable experience.
50,View inside and outside at pyramid room is awesome. Elevators traveling at angle is unexpected but fun at times especially if you had a few drinks overall wonderful experience. Bridge access to Excalibur great. Breakfast at Pyramid cafe is so good.
50,Had a great time with friends over the weekend. The hotel had a variety of restaurants and shops for every budget. I would stay here again. Price is reasonable. Only downside is the room had a marihuana smell to it. I didn't report it because I was very tired and wanted to sleep.
40,For the most part it was a good stay. Just a few things that I was not happy with. Mainly the uncomfortable bed and pillows. And when you check-in online they could give way better directions to your room.
10,I expect more from a hotel on the strip. Poorly equipped to handle an influx of guests. They need more staff. It is very difficult to reach the front desk and when you do they seem unable to address customer concerns.
10,We kept having to have our key cards keyed over and over. We kept getting stuck in the elevators and when you would go to guest services and bring it up there was CONSTANT negativity. We come here a couple times a year and would never come back to this hotel again. Our shower was leaking from where you turn the water on and the drain was broken. There is so exhaust fans in the bathroom and the rooms are poorly lit. Our room smelled really moldy and when we woke up every morning we were really congested but after we left the room we were fine. The house keepers only gave us 2 towels a day and they were very skimpy with products. DONT RECOMMEND!
10,In my first room the bed was not made properly and the floor had sand and dirt. The bathroom was also not washed. I was given a new room but it was not better. My room floor was dirty. My bathroom needed to be cleaned probably. On the bright side the bed was made properly. Did not have the energy to ask for another room change. Oh the elevator was also out for at least an hour on my check in day. I was not about to walk up 16 flights of stairs.
40,We loved the shower excellent. The gaming area was staffed perfectly. The bed was terrible I woke up in pain and slept terribly the second night. It used to smell amazing in the Luxor. It just smelled like smoke the whole trip this time. No room service for dinner was a bummer.
20,Had a great time gambling having access to mandalay but the rooms were old smelled like a motel 6 dusty clogged sinks. MGM needs to invest in upgrades here. We will not stay here again. Hopefully there are plans to upgrade here.
20,Experiences was not what I expected since it was first time at this hotel it was not what I expected with the other hotels I have stayed before. Took forever at the check in and also got lost several times
30,Don’t stay here if you plan to sleep. You can hear the casino music in your room all night long. The bass literally shakes your room. The pool isn’t heated and it was freezing even on an 80+ degree day.
50,Very Friendly and Professional staff  Sports Book area is outstanding  Restaurants and Bar areas are excellent  The Luxor has easy access and egress  The location is not too far from other casinos and restaurants in the area and those locations are very walkable.The Luxor is also very close to the airport.  Great golf is not too far away.  The Luxor is an overall great venue in Las Vegas.
10,They had agents selling timeshares posing as hotel employees collecting personal information. The mobile check in did not work. I paid for a pyramid room but none were available. My water quit working the 3rd night there then I paid for late check out but got emails and texts to check out at 11am.
10,I was not able to check in late and was charged a whole day due to the guest service line being long and no on available over the phone. I also was double charged for parking for 3 days. The elevator line to to exit the building was so long I couldn’t get out of the building for over an hour and the parking lot line was twice as long. A lot of time and money wasted.
30,Luxor is in need of updates. Overall very old and dirty. Staff does not enforce mask requirements- take that as a positive or negative depending on personal preference. Casino was very dirty and bar service almost nonexistent.
30,My stay would’ve been longer however I didn’t sleep that good in the room no coffee and water wasn’t accessible. I try to order food to the room you have to go downstairs to the gift shop which is absolutely outrageously priced. The theme of the Luxor seems to be missing. It’s too much clutter that doesn’t have anything to do with the Luxor there too many advertisements. It’s not that upscale so it was giving me more like circus type of hotel minus the attractions. 3.5 stars from me
50,Our room looked exactly like the photo during booking. Very clean and beds were comfortable. The shower only has a 1/2 glass stationary wall for the doors so water gets everywhere but that was our only issue. Staff was great from the pools casino's and housekeeping. The casino was beautiful with lots of amenities. Location was fine it was connected to Mandalay Bay and Excalibur so that was nice. To walk towards Planet Hollywood it was about a 15 minute walk so not too bad. There are plenty of places to eat within the hotel and 24/7 convenient stores. However if your up for a 15 minute walk you can get to a Walgreens Cvs or Target and avoid the high costs of the hotel convention store.
40,The experience a the Luxor was not good especially since this was my first time to Vegas. Rooms need to be better kept especially in these times of the COVID and everything and make sure everyone wear they mask if you say it needs to be on then police it.
40,It was a nice stay. Other than the problem with the door security (which they promptly took care of when I brought it to their attention) and the lack of a refrigerator in the room it was good. The staff was friendly and accommodating. The room was clean and nice and the beds were comfortable. The casino and the entertainment venues inside the property are nice.
40,I found the hotel rooms to be nice but not worth the price. I have stayed in much nicer hotels for way less. The air conditioning frequently turned off on its own and the room would get extremely hot. Also the lighting in the room was terrible even with all the lights on it was dim. Not ideal for ladies doing their makeup. Beds were comfortable! The electronic key cards work when they feel like it sometimes so that got to be annoying. We would have to change to the elevator next door and it would work there I didn't understand why it was so complicated. Check in and check out through mobile was smooth and easy so happy we did not have to wait in the long line up front.
50,This is my second stay at the luxor. ITS a great hotel to stay at its connected to the Excalibur and the Excalibur is connected to New York New York so it's so easy to get to the main area. The Rooms are great only thing is our room smelled like nail polish and it was strong . Other then that I would stay here again!
10,My didn’t kept stop working seems like my check out bill wasn’t right still haven’t gotten a response I asked for a refrigerator and they took all day I need it for my medicine they wait time for check in was real bad and when I asked for late check out they told me that I couldn’t get because it was on a Saturday and they r very busy
50,We had a wonderful time at the Luxor. Great rates helpful service. View from the room was beautiful. The bed and pillows were so comfortable I fell asleep with no problems. It also helped that we walked almost everywhere we went. We were able to also visit the Excalibur and Mandalay Bay hotels. We walked on the Las Vegas strip. Wonderful time.
10,On Sunday October 17th we arrived at the Luxor Casino Hotel we had our bags in the bell service until our room was ready. Once we checked into our room I removed some cigars from my backpack and we locked the room and left. We went to the bar and watched the Dallas Cowboys game. Once the game had ended we returned to our room the room was locked and no forced entree was noticeable my Camera backpack with over $8k in equipment was gone. At this point we went straight to the front desk and explained they were not very helpful at all just had security meet us at the room.. Security came took my statement they didn’t want a picture of what my bag looked like nor would they let me view any cameras or the electric key lock interrogation. This went on for three days with security and management. I also filed a police report.    Only one manager was nice and actually seemed to care. Now I have been home for two days. I have emailed the manager and left a message voicemail for guest relations but have yet to receive any type of response. The hotel is supposed to be a safe and secure place for us and our property. The management and security actually acted like we meant nothing. No answers no action just nothing. I’m extremely upset and this equipment means everything to me..    There needs to be some communication between the MGM Resorts and me.. My vacation was completely ruined and I continue to feel completely violated on many levels.
20,I had issues with check in. They said I was being upgraded because the room I paid for in advance was sold out…but failed to disclose the fact that I would have 2 queen beds instead of 1 king like I paid for. I’m a solo traveler and only wanted what I reserved. After scarring all of my luggage upstairs and traveling I was disappointed. I went back downstairs and the agent asked “what’s wrong with two beds”. I demanded a manager to rectify the situation. He disappeared for about 1 minute returned with no manager and magically found a king room for me (clearly he was lying all along). I also had issues with my parking pass. Apparently it was never activated. Every interaction with the front desk staff was a hassle. I did not eat or gamble there but I did enjoy the spa. I didn’t know until I got to Vegas that there is a huge difference between the north side of the strip and the south side. Had I known I never would’ve considered the Luxor. I found this hotel to be rather ghetto… the tv had very few stations there was no fridge the bathroom mirrors were dirty upon arrival… just ghetto across the board.
10,When my son and I entered our room (the 1st one) the room had VaJJ cream on the bed and the nightstand had used cups and water bottles on it that were half full. The dresser had food on it ( a loaf of bread meat and cheese) the shower had been used but the bedding had not been disturbed.    When we went back down to tell them about the room looking like it was occupied we were made to stand back in line again for 30 minutes. I asked for an upgrade and was completely ignored by the girl at the desk or could I least get free parking for the inconvenience I had to go through she again acted like the did not hear me and put me in another room no room disco or parking disco.    I was utterly shocked at the attitude of the staff. I even showed her pictures of the room to what we walked into. Nothing mattered to her and she would not even look at the photo's    So disappointed that this will be my first and last experience at this hotel. Just shocking.
50,Checked in electronically from home and they advised room would be ready around 3pm and would send electronic keys. Got to hotel around 1pm and didn’t leave my bag with Bell Hop and used an hour to check int MLife and grab a drink and ticket came over around 2 pm through email. Stood in no lines. Only problem was that elevator had hard time picking up my digital key on my phone so during off hours I went and got regular card key.
10,Was not told about a 200 deposit no mini fridge in the room no ice machine it was broken tried to call room service it took 30 mins or more to get someone no complimentary water while most hotels i have been to has water
10,very poor room quality. Old and also dirty furniture old and very tired decor. bathroom was substandard howe drain didn't flow properly. My room didn't have any hand towels or wash clothes no blankets in the room which was very cold as the hotel had not yet turned on the main heat system that control all rooms.
30,The casino was loose. This hotel is only good if you're just sleeping there. No entertainment. Really need to update the look and make rooms more modern. The elevator ride is scary as hell. It shakes like nothing is holding it.
10,Leaking sink wet bar broken. Moved at 230am keys wouldn’t work tag from last guest in room scum around knob in shower no coffee no wash clothes. Was told to come down next day at 11 and they would upgrade me rooms and higher up no rooms available so I was told they they blocked one after it was cleaned to come back after 2. Went back at 330 was told they were only upgrading me floors not rooms because nothing was available wanted to offer credit steak house was closed rest of my trip so I said no came back to finally upgrade rooms as well keys wouldn’t work stuck on elevator. Got charged for everything that was supposed to be cover by booking earned resort credit. NEVER AGAIN!!!!
50,No microwave in room or available for rental. Fridge needs to be rented as well not included. No complimentary breakfast for hotel guest. Mobile check-in was easy but still had to be in line to add the parking pass that I didn't know I needed in the first place. Can't have my baby on Casino floor even though it was sleeping in its stroller not bothering anyone. Found 3 roaches in the bathroom during my stay and the shower head pressure was really weak.
40,My stay was excellent however the draw back was no fridge but it is great location!!! Also the food was expensive go to the strip to eat it's much cheaper I love Vegas so much fun . I would choose Luxor again
50,From the moment I arrived at the Luxor the staff from the valet to the bellhop to the front deal went out of their way to show nothing but Courtesy and compassion. This property remains a olde but goode
30,I am kind of disappointed. I booked a king bedroom. When I got to the room it was a two queen bedroom which was really uncomfortable for me and my husband during the stay. Hotel is beautiful and room was nice but it was not what I booked.
20,Room didn't have heat. Had to move to a 2nd room. The 2nd room had very noisy children adjacent to our room. Seems like they bunch everyone together which makes for noisy neighbors. I won't stay here again.
40,I won't lie I really wanted to stay in the pyramid but I wasn't able to change rooms in the app or the mobile check in so I had to manage in a low floor poor view room. Hallway noise was not well blocked out thankfully I sleep with white noise. The bedding was comfortable the TV worked pretty well but the selection is limited.  The Luxor is a little dated but offers a great value and good sized rooms. The location is a little far down the strip but with good low priced gambling and a lot of dining I would come back again. And so help me I will stay in the pyramid before I croak!
10,Hard to find your way around even with the signs you get lost. Elevators with the key check system did not work sometimes so I could not get to my room for half an hour. Had to go to the front desk which had a line of 50 people. Went to the bell desk and was told I can get in the priority line which had 5 people in line. Instead of waiting a half hour at 11 PM I decided to find another way and after much work I found another guest going there who's key worked. So an hour to get up the elevator is unforgivable. Lot's of smoke in casino area drifted into the food areas as well. Other casinos have less smoke as they have better air cleaners. Could not get phone app to work for self park so paid two days out of pocket for self parking as there was always a huge line at the front desk. So paid double for two nights and one night I no longer had a car but 30 minutes on hold and I gave up. NOBODY goes to such a hotel to wait hours in line!!! Get some customer service help. I paid $45 too much for parking and there was nobody to talk to.
10,I’m very disappointed. There’s no refrigerator in the room no microwave there no menus for a first time visitor. There wasn’t any greeting no clocks in the room just terrible service all around. Wish they do better! They don’t help you they waited til 2 am to clean my room! Just pissed about the service. Also they didn’t put my comps to my mgm account. I WILL NEVER COME BACK TO THAT HOTEL!!!
10,The staff members were extremely rude. Room was the most disgusting room I’ve seen. It smelled terrible as soon as the door opened. The floors were not mopped and had something sticky spilt inside the doorway. The bathroom had trash on the floor and urine in the toilet. One of the beds was not made and the mattress was covered in urine. Expected to check into a decent hotel and instead felt I checked in to a pay by the hour motel. Left immediately and found another hotel to stay at for the week. Do not recommend anything to do with Luxor!
20,The Luxor is old and dingy. Like the inside of a tomb. No frills no food dining poor sports book poor pool. Stay at the Mandalay Bay if in town for a Raiders game. Not once did anyone from the Luxor ask us how our stay was going. The staff acts like mummies.
50,Super nice hotel in a very good spot specially if you are going to a Raiders game you can walk to the stadium. Friendly staff always looking to help you. Very clean rooms everything is great at The Luxor!
50,I love how easy it is to check in and you don’t have to stand in a line just to get your keys. The suite is also very nice and spacious and at a reasonable price compared to other hotels. I have been staying here for years.
50,We were very happy with the whole experience at the Luxor. Staff were helpful and friendly. We were hoping that the Buffet would be open longer hours with more dinner variety but overall was a great time.
30,The lobby and hallways were unusually dark. There were areas that were roped off for what appeared to be no reason. One of the elevators that we were directed to to get to our floor was out of service and remained that way for the duration of our stay. One of the moving sidewalks between Luxor and Excalibur was out of service and remained that way. When we left there appeared to be a homeless person on the elevator sitting on the floor with her shoes off and the contents of her backpack spread around her. I couldn't find any hotel personnel to report this to and didn't have time to wait in the checkout line.
10,Room wasn’t very clean there was no exhaust fan and the air was just really moist and wet in the room. The room also smelt really strong of pine and cinnamon. It was also on the end of the strip so I don’t think I’d ever stay here again.
50,I love this place our room was clean and I loved our view. The pools where amazing do wish the hot tub had more motor to it. I love how much the luxor has to offer. Lots of shows gambling. The staff was super nice
50,Luxor is great I love ancient Egyptian architecture awesome experience I hope they get it up to full running capacity because Covid pushed back our trip experience everyone should experience this hotel if they go to Vegas! Great job
10,The rooms were horrible they were filthy and ran down the hallways on the way to the room were ran down and there were people that hassled my girlfriend on the way with innapropriate comments and nefarious implied comments. The staff seemed bothered and annoyed the parking guys simply left saying f this job. The whole place was uncomfortable and simply no fun. I did win a few hundred dollars but found myself walking to other casinos just to enjoy a better experience. There’s no was possible I would ever stay there Gain
50,I was stranded when Southwest canceled all those flights. At 4am I found my luggage and then went about looking for a place to stay to kill 48 hrs. I’ve stayed at Luxor about 16 years ago. So it was first on my mind. Booked the room took a cab to Luxor then realized what time it was and check-in was many hours away. No problem. She got me into a room and offered a fractional day. Clean room. Quiet. I slept. Then enjoyed my stay. Thanks!
40,This was a great location to stay. Walking distance to other hotels. The valet was quick and would definitely recommend for a good friends trip. Only thing is the elevators are confusing depend on what tower you are staying in
30,The casino and employees are awesome. The rooms are clean as you would expect. The bed is good for sleeping. However the shower is in a TILE bathroom with only one door. After a shower the tile floor is soaked. Using a towel to soak up the water is a legitimate idea but housekeeping visited us once in five days of staying and we ran out of towels before they did. This is a safety hazard and damages the rating for my stay severely. A great casino to visit but without room service and without proper safe showers I am not sure how much I reccormend the Luxor to stay in.
20,We stayed in this hotel with 4 others. We usually stay at a different resort when in Las Vegas. Overall we would not return. It wasn’t memorable.    Room: we stayed in a double queen inside the pyramid. The hallways to get to the pyramid rooms are open and you can see down to Luxor below. It’s a cool view. The elevators are slow so you will wait about 5 minutes for it to even arrive. If there’s a line you will wait a while. The room was basic. The bathroom had a shower that drained extremely slow so you are standing in about an inch of water. That was unpleasant. The amenities were less than average. Bring your own toiletries they provide lotion and a combo conditioner shampoo. No coffee pot or fridge. The beds and pillows were comfortable but the sheets were thin. Not enough wall chargers for electronics. The carpets needed to be cleaned. It was spacious for 2 people.    Resort fee: includes local calls wifi boarding pass printing gym. No parking included.    Check-in: you can check-in at the front registration desk or via the MGM app.  I chose the convenience of the app and checked in 1 day before my arrival date. The registration desk line is usually long.    Parking: either pay for valet or pay for self parking. Self parking is not connected to the hotel so it’s an inconvenience and quite a walk if you forget something. Make sure you either add parking during your reservation or take your self parking ticket to the registration desk so they can link it to your room key and it gives you in and out privilege for 24 hours if you decided to use self park for 24 hours.    Dining: there’s a food court with pizza Jonny rockets fried chicken- there’s also a Diablos Cantina. The Jonny rockets was good and so was their shake. Friends mentioned the Diablo Cantina was average. There’s other restaurants on the casino floor.    There are different vibes of bars some with DJs. They play hip hop music.    Casino: slots and table games. Nothing attractive for blackjack.    Staff: none of the staff members stood out.    Pyramid room and hotel amenities: No refrigerator or minibar fridge no microwave no coffee pot. There’s wifi included gym pool iron hair dryer combo shampoo/conditioner lotion bar soap tissues phone bottled water cups tv table and 2 chairs dresser safe ice bucket vending machine by ice machine check in via the app and a virtual key in the app.
30,We meet some very nice people during our stay. But our only down falls about our stay is our room was so hot we couldn't get any sleep. To being woke up to loud music from the room next door. Then dealing with a homeless person following us around in the casino to watching the bum still the bar tenders tips. Oh if you don't mind paying for Starbucks everyday then this is the place to stay. The room does not have a coffee make or a fridge.
40,Starbucks prominent eatery on site; long long waiting times day or night; not all opened on time; popular items frequently ran out early am (inexplicable); watch for dusting in areas like lamps phone baseboards if you are asthmatic or allergic; staff did clean slot machines frequently; bell captain very efficient and friendly; helpful with bags down from room and for check out
30,Bathroom are dated and moldy but I liked the rest of the hotel. Staff was very nice. We stayed here Bc we wanted to watch the blue man group and it was fantastic! The rooms were a bit noisy people running down the hallway at 2am loud.
10,Rooms are tired - staff is rude all across the property - everyone of them blamed Covid for the poor service. Was supposed to get a discount for joining M club - didn’t - Mobile App very hard to use - couldn’t get out of the parking garage with physical or mobile key. Won’t stay again :(
50,It was my first time staying here at Luxor. I wasn’t really in my room but I was comfortable when I was. I slept well. I stayed in the East Tower. I liked that you had to use your room key to use the elevator. My room had both a shower and tub.
30,This hotel was too crowded and the clientele seemed very trashy. The line for check in was very long and moved slowly. The staff was accommodating when I asked for our 2 rooms to be near each other. The rooms were very nice and clean. I also liked the free parking.
50,I had a great time at the Luxor. The casino is always fun but the updated room was a great surprise. I love the art! It reminds me of the beauty of the desert.  The one thing I miss is the Egyptian theme. I would've liked to have felt like I were in a modern Egyptian hotel as if the culture were alive today. Just my thoughts
30,Used the mobile app to check in and made our keys.Went to the elevators twice and the keys would not work. Went to the front desk and Marissa quickly made us new keys and directed us to the correct elevators. She was pleasant and professional and even gave us a comp for our inconvenience. We had been using the wrong elevators! We needed some extra towels and they promptly brought us more. The room did not have a fridge microwave or coffee maker. The bathroom had a nice deep tub and separate shower. The bed was comfortable and temp. was great. Noise level was low and slept well. The SPA was amazing! Had a great massage from Frank and the best facial ever from Cynthia. Will definitely come back for the SPA treatments!! Might stay at the hotel/resort but would hope to have a room with better amenities.
20,I booked 2 rooms in the pyramid for my kids to see. They were all out of rooms so they moved us to 2 rooms in the east tower looking at a parking garage. The room was comparable to a motel 6 in appearance.  I stayed there many years ago and it was in much better shape. There were a lot of scuff marks everywhere.
50,Nice room I liked the spaciousness of the living room didn’t love that the bathroom didn’t have a door but still nice. Cleaning lady was nice I wish there was a microwave. I liked the restaurant upstairs
10,Hotel was dirty with trash and spills. Our room didn’t even have blankets on the bed when we checked in. Anything you needed like towels TP or blankets took 30+ minutes to arrive and they wouldn’t let you pick them up from desks. They gave us no special amenities or even congrats for it being our wedding trip—I wasn’t expecting much but you figure a Vegas hotel would do something to celebrate. The clerk that checked us i. Was the only on to even say anything despite it being known that it was for our wedding to which she grumpily said “oh so your life is over” which felt rude and hurtful on what should have been a joyous event. They were redoing the window decals on the side of the building we were on and their squeaking and clanking with their tools kept us up all hours of the night. Zero customer service bad shops bad price far from strip. No amenities poorly prepared rooms. Filthy. I could go on.
30,We went for our 15th anniversary and room was freezing. After 2nd trip to front desk we were told that the boiler system was not switched over to heat yet. Lows in the 40’s. So I was told we have no control over the room temperature. This was a suite with 2 HVAC units and had to shut the fans off of both of them to conserve some heat.
40,The shower was weird One door so there is water all over the floor. Had to get extra towels to put down. No refrigerator in case you need to put meds in one. It’s $25.00 a day. Nice location casino was very nice
30,It was alright for the price but staff will push you out when it’s checkout time. Would have appreciated a more nicer approach instead of entering my room 2 times asked if we’re ready to go yet at 11:03
20,Wasn’t great a lot of restaurants were closed room wasn’t clean took 2 hours for them to come clean the toilet room was still dirty didn’t come clean the room for 3 days out 5 smelled like cigarettes
10,The staff was awful they didn’t check our bags and they kicked us out of empty seats at the pool that was closed never again it completely blew my mind now rude the staff was but it’s alright its not like we or anyone I know will come here again
40,Went here and stayed at Luxor of course overall very happy. The west tower is the place to stay newer quieter and no inclinator type elevators that make noise. The casino itself is in good repair there are good food options in the casino and on the floor including Diablos mexican the staff there is excellent beers are cold and good food is good.
30,Not the cleanest but def not the worst. Rideshare access was located in a convenient location. I’d stay here again to save money but not for any other reason. Mattresses were kinda hard… and they only had 2 pillows per queen bed other hotels had 4 each. There is a waffle stand down by the spa I would definitely recommend waffles and crepes from there!
10,I started staying at Luxor because of the upgraded rooms and such. The prices were affordable and I even signed up for the MGM application to take advantage of the point and offers. My first three stays were great but this last stay was horrible. I don't think I will be staying here again due to the last experience. I will also stop using MGM hotels and casinos and switch over to The Caesar's hotels and apps. Even when I explained the stay to the hotel staff at checkout no apology was given not even a free parking fee was offered. I at least expected the employee to offer me free parking. Overall the room rate was decent for a Sunday night no sports channels in room smelled like mildew flooring in hallways were wet blowers were too loud room was not at standard cleanliness staff was disappointing. I was not satisfied at all. Thank you.
50,We have stayed at other hotels in Las Vegas just to try them but we will never stay anywhere else but the Luxor from now on. This hotel is by far the best! Loved the staff the hotel in general. Hope the next time we come we can stay longer that's how much we love it.
50,Friendly staff and comfortable room with a great amenities. Room was ready at requested time and there were no issues with billing or checking out when the stay was over. I would definitely recommend staying.
30,No USB ports. Over 15 minutes to get a hotel operator on the phone. TV didn't work!  Location is good and this was the worst experience I've had with the LUXOR. I'm not sure I'll ever use this hotel again.
40,Staff was very friendly food was good accommodations were clean and nice. Good room safety. Wish the pool was open later at west towers. Overall I would certainly recommend the resort particularly so when I consider the price.
20,Property from the outside looks beautiful but once you check in Lahore will begin check-in lines ridiculous express check-in pathetic the app does not tell you exactly where your room is at that lights in my hotel room TV would not cut on guest services staff did not step in to action until the fifth time I went to the front desk just horrible downright horrible!!
50,Every single employee was very nice and professional they all went above and beyond when I had a question.  Room was very clean unfortunately there was no coffee maker or fridge inside the room. Easy to get to the pool and parking lot. The “relief” area for pets was near by the main entrance it was well kept.
50,Always first class stay at Luxor. Everyone should receive the kind of first class treatment I always receive at Luxor. I’ve stayed at many other Las Vegas resorts and I can honestly say that the staff at Luxor are the best. Can’t wait to go back.
30,I had booked a room in the pyramid and the front desk check in guy said basically those rooms were super old and sad which I gather from others I've spoken to is true. So he gave me a West tower room but it was literally right by the elevators and vending machines so I wonder if he just hated me on sight. It was so freaking noisy. Aside from that the room was okay. No amenities. I guess I'm used to basic amenities. It was clean. The beds were comfortable Two pillows per bed no more. There are really aggressive salespeople in the businesses I won't go into detail but if anyone wants to try out an eye cream on you- please keep walking. That was one of the worst experiences I've ever had and I thought I was savvy. My son liked it but I won't book there again.
30,For the price of this place I expect immaculate conditions. Some of the outlets didn't work and had to charge cell phone in the bathroom. I stayed in a room for four people and only two towels were in the bathroom. I called housekeeping for towels and it took two hours for them to arrive and I was in bed asleep. Wifi is spotty and didn't work a lot of the time to use the digital key on the app. Cell service inside is terrible. Check in is awesome using the app and I highly recommend it otherwise have fun standing in line for an hour at the front desk. The scenery is fantastic in the hotel.
30,We have been staying at Luxor almost exclusively 2-3 times a year for the past 20 years. Because of the lack of restaraunts and poor choice of dinners we are checking out other alternatives. Buffet was open but only until 3 and was almost all breakfast food so not good for dinner.
40,King corner suite was nice and clean very dated though. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Location is a little far feom any convience stores or drugstores so be sure to stock up before getting to the hotel. The store on site is very expensive
10,I was perturbed initially by the crooked valet. Then I checked in and was excoriated by a staff member for where I parked. Then the room was dirty. It was like somebody used the room after cleaning because there was no shower towel on the rack above tub. Then I had loud neighbors. Rampant pot smoking as well.
10,We had real bad experience this time bad customer service problems with elevator ( I was stocked in it twice ) totally different with what I was promised bad the worse part is that no one did nothing to solve the issue with my rooms cancelation or stay it was only to my check out that they asked me about my expectations
30,We have traveled to quite a few hotels on the strip prior to 2020. The Luxor is in need of a complete renovation of their pyramid rooms which are very dated. Our AC was broken and stuck blasting cold air and the hair dryer was broken. The newer key on the phone system for the elevator and room is extremely problematic and we heard numerous parties complaining about it as they sat frustrated in the elevator. In addition the elevator invariably had one or two out of order with no option to take the stairs without setting off the emergency alarm. If I had to stay there again I would stay in the tower not the pyramid. Our son was in a tower room which was much nicer than ours for the same cost. He could take the stairs as well and had a hair dryer and working AC. I know COVID has been hard on LV hotels and the workers were very nice to us but something has to change if they want to remain a viable destination in the future.
40,We have stayed here twice and we enjoy the chill laid back experience of the pool. The atmosphere is fun and the people are nice. We definitely have this on the list as another potential stay. Only thing I wish the room had was a fridge.
30,"I took my 8-year old son to Luxor Las Vegas because he was studying Egypt and I though it would be a great trip. We got Blue Man Group tickets and got excited! The hotel was underwhelming and not always age appropriate--giant screens at check-in and throughout promoted shows--including their strip tease show--and showed videos that were not at all family friendly. We stayed in the ""renovated"" rooms that should have been nicer but wallpaper was peeling off in the hallways our room had no view and the exterior of the windows was filthy. Oh and the pillows were horrible. Not the worst trip overall but a bit disappointing."
10,Stayed 2 nights at Mandalay Bay at beginning of trip. Needed 1 night before flying home and the rate at Mandalay was ridiculous. MGM sugested the LUXOR at $200 less. This room was the worst room I have stayed in in the last 10 years.
50,We stayed in the pyramid & our room was great! It was very clean. Only downfall was no mini fridge or coffee maker in room. Staff was great/friendly everywhere. Room was cleaned and bed made daily by room service. Great location and connection to other hotels. Would come back! Great value!
50,Excellent experience! Staff is very friendly rooms are clean and beds are very comfortable. Nice casino and bars in hotel. Quiet in the rooms so sleeping was not an issue. Great location and connects to several other hotels. We will be back
10,Patrons BEWARE!!!! My brother and I stayed at the Luxor Hotel and Casino on Sunday October 17th. Long story short we left our bags in the hotel room for 4 hours and came back to a missing backpack with over $6000 of technology equipment cameras lenses chargers and KEYS TO DRIVE HOME AND GET INTO the condo states away!!!! Security and hotel management were a joke and treated as they are not responsible! Save yourself 5 hours of talking to management hotel “security“and going to the police station to file a police report AND DONT STAY HERE EVER!!! They will NOT compensate you for a second if your time AND if you tell them you don’t feel safe and request another room they will downgrade you. Beware and save yourself time and money. You clearly get what you paid for.
40,Had a great stay! Clean rooms the only problem was the digital key didn’t work for my room and when I got a physical room key it still didn’t work. The buffet was great and clean really like the omelet station and drink variety. The staff was helpful when we had a question about something. Would stay here again !
30,This is right by the stadium so if you want to go to the game and watch it's walking distance. That being said after the game the fans are rowdy and drunk they were beligerent and the staff did nothing..People were passed out at the bar and they were loud and obnoxious. There is no late night food and our room hadn't been properly cleaned in a while...the floor was wet in our room and it took FOREVER to check in....It's ok if you are on a budget..and the food choices are MINIMAL....
50,We have stayed at the Luxor twice. Both of our trips to Vegas. Each time we were checked in fast and greeted with professionalism and friendly attitudes. Our rooms were spotless and the housekeeping staff was great! The casinos and restaurants were amazing so there is no reason to move to another resort!
30,A lot of maintenance is needed inside. Many moving walkways were down so there was a lot of unassisted walking. The room had some small issues with the toilet and the sink. Allergies were an issue while inside of our room.
40,"Check in was great hotel was very nice. Food options on site were decent but not fantastic. The room was dim and the lamps had to be ""half turned on"" in order to work. Location was good at the end of the strip easy to get to other hotels and the overall value I think makes it worth it!"
50,It’s was a good stay and food was good and drinks was on point. I would love to come back and the titanic was great. The room was clean and housekeeping was very friendly and understanding with bringing extra towels.
10,Used to love the Luxor . This trip has changed my mind. Elevators have glitches room aren’t very good and try to contact front desk or concierge is non existence. Very sad stay this time. Which will probably be my last time at this property.
50,Had a really nice stay for two nights. Easy check in. Did not even have to go up to desk. Very friendly staff. Rooms were clean. Housekeeping was good and very nice. Nice big casino and good food options.
20,The Luxor is past it’s prime that is for sure. It is not worth the super high prices. The beds are awful and the bedding is as cheap and old as it gets.    I went for work I’m happy I didn’t end up paying for the stay. I don’t recommend it there are too many other choices in Vegas.
30,There is no shower door so when you shower water gets all over the bathroom floor. This was surprisingly more irritating than you would think. Its not that the shower door was missing there just isn't one there at all.
40,Everything was great with Luxor the only problem was the room it seemed as though I was staying and a lower end casino the where I actually was. But after that everything else was great still had a great time would come back again.
30,No coffee maker or fridge in room. Not enough towels. Shower only had half a glass door which leads to alot of water out. Housekeeping wakes you up and tries to get in room on checkout day two hours before.
10,My room was on elevator 1B in a corner a half mile from every other elevator and the only one that took me to my floor. I walked more getting to my room than i did on the strip. The room has no fridge it stays at 80+ degrees with AC set as low as it goee the bed is hard as a rock and if you happen to need anything once you are in your room i hope you get a room near an elevator. Between the walk from my room to the elevator the average 5 minute wait time at the elevator and the walk from my elevator to anything in the hotel/casino area it was not worth leaving my room at all for water ice the vending machine that wont take cards or cash or the shop in the lobby to get your 5 dollar bottle of water. I wouldnt wish this hotel on my worst enemies.
20,The rooms are completely outdated. The common areas are gorgeous but once you enter the rooms it’s a big disappointment. For this to be a MGM property it lacks the MGM feel room cleanliness and customer service. Several amenities are missing like refrigerators microwaves and proper shower doors
40,The Luxor was a very pleasant hotel to stay at in my experience. The rooms were clean staff was diligent when necessary and the MGM app provided a lot of convenience in mobile check in/check out to avoid the line. All told for a place to kick back after a long day in Vegas the Luxor is a good spot.
30,3 of the 4 elevators were down in the corridor we had to use to get to our room for half of our stay. This created long waits to go up and down and it was my understanding that stairs were not as option as they were for emergency use and we were 16 floors up anyway. Also the bathroom in our pyramid room was poorly designed leading to constant wet floors after showers and nowhere to hang towels. The location of the hotel is also a bit far from most places we wanted to go because it is at one end of the Strip. I will pay more attention to location next time I visit Las Vegas. Wouldn’t recommend and would not stay here again.
10,Unsatisfied visit old building with moldy window seals. No shower doors. My card was double charged. I was also charged an no show charge when I called to notify them my flight was cancelled due weather and no pilot. There were no shower door to close. Water was everywhere. I had to request extra towels. I will never return back there and I will not recommend this place to anyone not even the dead. Beware!
50,Had a tremendous experience at Luxor and will certainly be back. Luxor is a place that is very family friendly. The next time my wife and I go we’ll most certainly take our child. The Strip is very wild and with Luxor being slightly off the strip we don’t get all that craziness.
50,I had a great room on the 25th floor right in the middle of the pyramid. It lined up almost perfectly with the obelisk and sphinx outside making for some great pictures. The room was a perfect size for what i needed. I traveled solo. I did t gamble at all so couldnt really rate the casino. It was also connected to some cool stuff like the excalibur.
50,Good customer service overall experience staff were very friendly and willing to help direction to places was easy too.    The rooms are very clean and the money was well worth for the services we got. Will stay with them again next time
10,Our one night stay in Luxor was very dissatisfactory. Both reserved rooms smelled as if the previous occupants smoked and pieces of pretzel were found on the floor. The hotel is very old and you can see that with extensive elevator wait-time (4-6 minutes) lack of automatic doors and inconveniently long walkway to the lyft/uber areas. Would not recommend staying at Luxor. The only positive thing we experience was the fantastic food at Diablo's Cantina in Luxor.
40,Great location clean rooms friendly staff and Price of hotel rooms are great. We are able to have a variety of food options Buffay find dining restaurant experience. The shopping in the area is great as well as the casino play.
40,I really liked being able to go from Luxor to Excalibur or Mandalay Casinos without going outside. The casino area was very clean and orderly. All staffing that we encountered were friendly and helpful.
20,If your looking to stay in the midst of the strip do not stay at the Luxor. This hotel is at the end of the strip (close to the Las Vegas sign) and although only a 3-5min drive to the strip easily a 30min walk. The hotels website made this location and experience look exceptional however once in the hotel we were highly disappointed from the hot water not working no heat in the rooms lack of communication from the staff no working wifi and the best part (sarcasm) the shower is designed with half a door this kept the bathroom floor soaked even with multiple towels down. Would not recommend.
10,There were many issues on this trip. The line ups to check in were very long remote check in didn't work no staff available to help no heat in the room poor heat for the shower a poor fitting door that needed to be replace (bubbling on the door to the bathroom) poor parking. The parking was to be free according to the booking but on arrival we were only giving the valet parking option (many lanes were closed) then told we had to pay $15 per day to self park or $30 for valet. The staff was hard to find and the lines were so long it just wasn't worth waiting to get issues fixed. IT was only cold on the last couple of days and we stayed at another hotel for a grand canyon trip. This hotel was much better equipped and was cheaper.
50,This hotel is on the South side of the strip but is well connect by the tram the connects the Mandalay Bay and Excalibur Casinos. There is also a indoor walkway and shops the connect all 3 as well. In addition the elevators to the higher floors are a treat to experience. The walkway to the rooms gives a great overview of the casino floor if you stay in the pyramid. Rooms rates are cheap but the rooms are on par with all the other hotels on the strip
10,Outdated overbooked our room and downgraded us upon arrival. Dirty room pubic hairs in bathtub. Stingy with resupplying. Walls are paper thin could hear neighbors on both sides and upstairs using bathroom. Sad unpleasant stay
10,Not worth it so many things wrong. With extensive choices in other hotel properties choose another one. The checkin process was horrible experience pool experience was horrible and we had phantom fees added to our bill in which they would not remove.
40,Great Value! The room was clean and the hotel has several food options within and in Mandalay Place and Excalibur walkway. Staff and housekeeping were friendly and attentive to any need I had. Monorail fairly close at MGM Grand for easy complete Strip availability.
30,If you travel on business make sure you wait in the long long line to check out in person. If you use the more convenient online option it will be like pulling teeth to get a receipt and itemized statement emailed to you. It says your statement will be emailed but that's a lie. The room was nice and the staff that managed the conference area was exceptional. Floors were noisy you could literally hear conversations in the next room or in the hall. Ok if you're there to have fun not so much if you have meetings or presentations in the early morning.
40,We have stayed at the Luxor several times through the years. This was our first time in the Towers and it was great! The new check in process with the app saves standing in line and check out is effortless. We love the south end of the strip and to me the Luxor Towers is the best bang for your buck.
30,In Vegas for biz convention at the next door Mantalay Bay. The casino and restaurants were okay. Food and drinks overpriced of course but decent. We found the common areas clean and friendly. We stayed in a pyramid room. Elevators (inclinators) took a little getting used to. The room was large and very clean. Only complaint - and only reason this is not a higher rating - is the absence of any room amenities: No fridge no microwave no coffeemaker. Prevented us from having any drinks or snacks in the room. We were forced to take all meals in the expensive restaurants. Had to trudge through lobby to restaurant to pay for coffee. That was disappointing.
10,Rooms were dirty and ready and run down.  Outside of our room we’re just ledges of dirt and garbage that no one seems to care to pick up. Cabana we rented was ripped and run down. I would not recommend staying here.
50,MGM app is a must makes the whole process efficient. Plenty of restaurants to choose from loved that Luxor and Mandalay are connected to experience shops at both casinos blueman grp and fantasy are must see shows at the Luxor
10,We had too many issues to mention but here are a few: the room given to us upon arrival had to be cleaned again upon our arrival. There was hair lots of dust stains on carpets sheets and furniture the carpet was inadequately vacuumed fixtures falling from the wall etc.    We were treated rudely by multiple staff members    Wait times for guest services are always insane (on the phone and in person).    Serious remodeling and retraining is needed.
10,Don’t waste your money here. They push for everyone to do check and out on the app as if you are a burden being there bell desk has extremely rude and unprofessional workers isolated at end of strip rooms and line dirty and no stocked what staff members we did encounter were not very friendly except for one wonderful waitress on the casino floor that worked in the mornings.
20,Last weekend my granddaughter and i stayed at the Luxor. We were getting ready to go to a wedding. There was a knock on the door before I could answer it a man used a pass key to come in. We could have been naked!!!! He said he needed to check the phone. It upset both of us. I don’t think this is normal. I am now not sure he was really checking the phone.  And we had to pay $15 dollars a day to park…….really. I don’t have to at other hotels in Vegas.  We won’t be staying there again.
50,Decided to meet in Vegas at the last minute to meet family. Chose Luxor because we had not stayed there before. Very pleased…upgraded to a Tower Room…very nice. Very clean & great service. Would definitely stay again!
50,I loved the hotel the only problem I encountered was the heat in my room didn't work. I asked for a blanket and was quickly brought one. No one ever came about the heater though. I would surely recommend the Luxor to family or friends visiting Vegas. It was a great experience.
50,Our anniversary trip to the Luxor was relaxing and so fun!! We love the location and the kind  caring staff! It is near several easy to walk to casinos and near some nice eating places. We had a blast !
50,I loved our room. It was very clean. The decor was very tasteful. The bed was fabulous. I don't know what people are talking about who have given this hotel a poor rating. It's not old the employees weren't rude and the food was really good. We ate at Diablo's and the food was great. They also had an early check-in which I thought was simple and convenient and I really appreciated it. The staff was helpful and very pleasant. I would stay here again and would recommend it to anyone.
50,Absolutely must visit for an inexpensive but top class resort right on the Main Strip: I was insanely surprised at how little I spent on the hotel considering the location how many restaurants it has and the accessibility of shows exhibits as well as how close a walk it is to the rest of the Strip!
20,Nice enough but lacked standard hotel room amenities pool closes at 6pm resort fee is too high for services you won't use. Long lines mediocre customer service. Rooms were clean and we slept wellat least. Multiple trips to front desk to resolve issues with check inroom keys parking etc. Big hassle.
30,Hard to explain but this place did not WOW me. The location is inconveniently away from the strip the Tropicana had better slots. The New York New York is a better stay so is The Park. It's hard to put makeup on an old casino.
50,Quiet cool clean room. Friendly staff great housekeeping. So many things to do inside the hotel. Conveniently located right on the strip with easy access to the nearby Mandalay shopping center and within a fifteen minutes walk to all major shows on the strip
30,You can not go down and take a steam or use the spa without paying for a service such as a massage. You should have a method charge membership whatever to go down and use the steam without needing a massage facial etc.
20,MGM makes you pay for parking even after paying $39.98 resort fee. The parking is on the opposite end of the front desk. After making it to check-in the line was 50 people deep! Casino was dirty smoky and poor signage. We asked for assistance and needed receive any help. We will not return to a MGM property again. Stay at Caesar's hotel - no parking fees and much cleaner.
20,Disappointed past host was a Dream this one …you want to throw water on to see if she melts!………………request someone else if you want to stay here. Get the impression they are not appreciating our business someone made some dumb decisions trying to recoup lost funds.
10,Need renovation furniture are beat up even the upgrade ones waitresses were very rude restaurant’s all closed at evening time I was so hungry at 11 pm called for room service and was informed by the system that no service was available until next day.
20,Stay at literally any other resort. Dirty room; rude employees ghetto guests subpar food disorganized to the fullest and convoluted buulding structure. 2 bedroom suite was just 2 separate rooms that were separate required different entry walkways and no key was even given for the second room until you bring it to their attention....
40,The location of the Luxor was good staff was friendly and helpful plenty of restaurants onsite it was a good experience. We have stayed there before and we would stay there again. It is a comfortable property!!
50,Friendly atmosphere. Clean. Great fun. Accomodating staff. Everyone adhered to masks and safety prodicals. Felt safe. Good food. Location is great. Easy to access other MGM properties. Rooms very clean and private.
40,We had a good time at the Luxor. Things are opening up in the area. It is a GREAT idea to check in on their app as the lines seem to always be long for check it. I think that is normal. We got coffee in the little restaurant instead of Starbucks and the taste and service were amazing.
40,Very good accommodations check in/out good room cleanliness excellent.  Restaurant available hours poor likely due to lack of staff Covid 19.    Casino clean slots good. Lack of restrooms in casino noticeable.
40,Rooms well kept. Hotel staff were super friendly and helpful. Only negative was rude girl at 27/7 convenience store that was playing rap music too loud. Her coworkers weren’t happy but because of current climate we’re afraid to say anything.
40,Really busy hotel..thats the reason for 4 stars instead of 5..has alot to do..the shows were nice..it takes a minute to get taxis there because of the large crowds .that was my only hang up..food could was fair..Diablo Cantina has great food as well as the Pyramid Cafe.one other knock was the elevator were hard to find
30,Cheetos and rotten fruit in floor dirty towels maid don’t even clean room at all the shower has no door so all the water spills out parking is terrible and when you ask for assistance they ignore you and the never stay here if there’s a game cause you will wait hours for parking
50,over the years I have visited the luxor at least 10 times and last experience i was pleasantly surprised with the service and changes that they implemented front desk was courteous and efficient Dahlia took care of us and went out of her way to accommodate my requests very happy with my stay and looking forward to go back
10,Fees additional charges being added without disclosing fees such parking for guests this should be disclosed when booking the trip at the web site no at checking time. Lack of transparency on the pricing of the reservation
50,The check in was super easy. One issue I had was the carpet in my room was wet. Also the digital key on the app was a pain. The second night stay was wonderful! Staff is helpful check out was also easy.
50,For so many rooms and people this place is well taken care of the rooms are super clean  sheets are fresh anything you need they will attend you immediately. Staff is nice and value is a plus especially if you have mlife.
50,Over all everything & everyone provided excellent service! I would recommend the property to my family and friends. The food eateries where great and affordable. I wish the Buffet had a bit more selections to afford.
50,We all had a great time at luxor we got the the restaurants and pools also spent a lot of time at the slots machines all the stuff had a great attitude in all the departments and very polite this is what I really liked the first time a came here and the reason for my return to luxor i will definitely came back a third time .
30,The room was clean but showing some wear. Good shower pressure but had only a half shower door. ( shower only half enclosed). Bathroom floor gets wet.  Good service from casino and hotel staff. Not all of the restaurants were open.
40,Tower room was nice for the price. Bit of a maze to get to elevator and room. Only real complaint was the fragrance they use in casino was strong made me want not spend time on the gaming floor or restaurants
50,As soon as I got into the line to do the Check-In a super friendly staff member approached to me and asked me if I would like to complete the process electronically. She guided me using her device and it took nothing! Just a few moments and then I was on my way to my room which was very clean.
10,While leaving the bell Desk WOULDNT help to resolve the issue I had w taking a scooter . Without people to gamble there would be no Las Vegas.VERY DISAPPOINTED W THE HOTEL AND HOEL MANAGER. As a person with disabilities with walking it very sad to see people not wanting to help
30,The rooms in the pyramid even the “premier” rooms are heavily used and in bad need of repairs and updates. The ceiling above the shower was peeling the door delaminating the carpet stained the furniture badly beaten up and the AC unit (practically an antique) would not work. The rooms in the towers are much nicer and newly renovated however they lack the bragging rights of “staying in the pyramid.”
40,I had a little difficulty with my check in unaware of the mobil app check in. The lady that was helping left so a little disapointed. Anyway my stay is quite good. I enjoyed the slot tournament. And I like the room a little bigger that what it used to be.  .
40,I loved the hotel great value! Love the pyramid everything was extremely nice I love the big TVs when you check in nice music definitely good vibes I will come back here again if you are on a budget but still looking for a nice place to stay this is where you want to be
30,My first room located in the pyramid was supposed to be really good and big but it all just seems very outdated just does not trigger any awe effect when entering the room. Found multiple hairs on bathroom floor and counter that was gross. Changed to a room in the newer west tower the process was easy and hassle free. Definitely a bit better. Average I would say however no fridge no microwave in any of the rooms.
40,lots of resturants and easy access to sister properties (excalibur and mandalay bay) good mix of new and old slot machines also a variety of table games. check in was easy just scan the qr code on mgm app to get keys or just head to room and activate the keyless entry from your phone.  i recommend getting atleast one key it was hard to get keyless entry to work on elevator which you need to get to your floor. elevaters are alittle shakey but your accending at a 39degree angle pretty neat and walkway to room you can look down and see the casino floor below.
30,If you are into drunks pot smokers poor slots and daily parking fees this is your place. Not like 2015 to 1992 when I used to go monthly. No it just a joke where everything is overpriced. 8.50 a beer? 35.00 each buffet with nothing special to eat. Used to have guest services walk the floor to meet customers and make them feel welcome. Not anymore just give them your hard earned money. Don't waste your money here.
20,We came over to Vegas to celebrate my wife birthday. At first we got problems at check in the way the staff runs the check in line isn't very efficient. We got pulled out to do mobile check in and that end up taking twice as long. Beside room cleanliness wasn't the best! No amenities available. House keeping wasn't done properly. I don't think I'll be back to this hotel.
30,It was a nice stay but there was no refrigerator or microwave that was the only pitfall.. everything else was wonderful and the front desk was very helpful and courteous. Hopefully next time I can stay longer
40,Cleaning staff is very efficient however they left my room open post-cleaning. Nothing was missing or my rating would be a lot lower. Public House is a great sports bar with excellent food. Elevators take a bit to get used to.
10,The room was nice! But the front desk customer service were very rude. I requested to speak with a manager and they were just as rude. I can see how front desk thinks it is okay to be rude to their customer's.
50,i ALWAYS stay at the Luxor rooms are great staff is always helpful and the occasional upgrade doesnt hurt but you gotta be polite about it. its close to everything and far away enough from everything plus who doesnt love the inclinator. Thank You Luxor for always showing my family a great stay.
20,Love proximity to Allegiant stadium thought this would be my go to for every game.  The room seem clean then after a long day I pull back the shower curtain it was full of hair. Housekeeping supervisor said she would send the problem up the chain someone would contact me. Did not hear anything when I inquired  there was no record of the issue.
50,We always stay at Luxor. Great place! Good places to eat and the staff is always very accommodating. It is in a great location on the strip. You can walk to Mandalay Bay and Excalibur without going outside when it is so hot!
50,Our stay in September was great! We have stayed at Luxor many times before I like it because its super clean the rooms are nice the pool area is amazing & its easy to get in & our of the parking structure. The restaurants have very good food too. I will for sure stay there again.
40,Guest rooms were very adequate. The front desk was flawless. I thought the food was WAY over priced. The Slot machines were so tight it was not even fun to play. No matter what machine or what bet nothing worked. I think they are making up for lost revenue.
10,Housekeeping came in without knocking and seen my girlfriend naked. They did nothing but offer to take off my resort fees for a day or give me a free lunch. I was very unsatisfied. I will not be returning
50,I was in Vegas for the Heavyweight Championship fight. I had a great stay at the Luxor. Big soaker tub nice stand up shower hot water cold AC! The only things missing were a refrigerator and a microwave in the room.
40,The customer service was spectacular but my room was a little warm and I had the thermostat on the lowest setting and it was still rather warm. Overall Other than that I had a wonderful time eating and looking at the various art in the hotel. I loved how big the room and hotel is overall.
10,When we got there a day late I went to the bathroom lifted up the seat and seen poop splatter. I immediately called downstairs. I was informed they would move me but it never happened. My wife cleaned it
30,Unfortunately the Luxor is starting to show its age. The most disappointing part was the food in the cafe for price and that guest have to pay for parking. There should be a way to validate the parking ticket for guest. Vegas as a whole just nickel and dimes the guest to death.
40,The hotel was super busy the day we arrived but Claire helped make check in super easy and quick! The decor around the hotel was superb. The only down side (at least for me) was the beds would sink in where you’d lay and it would feel like you’d fall out of bed.
30,Beds definitely need to be upgraded our bed was terribly uncomfortable. Not what I would expect for a Vegas hotel. On our floor 4th the wallpaper was peeling along the hallway wall. The check-in process was aggravating because I was told that they had no more King beds available when I reserved the room months in advance and paid a deposit to hold our room!
10,Do yourself a favor and do not check-in until later in the evening! Rooms were not ready when I tried to check-in at 3pm. I had to wait an additional 3 hours to receive my room! When I did finally get the keys to the room the bathroom was very dirty! GROSS!
10,For the same amount of money you can enjoy a cleaner more upgraded hotel. Even though this chain of hotels started charging for the parking which makes it unwelcoming it’s for poor service when you want to drive around. The phone to get service will ring non stop with no answer.
10,I understand the Luxor is closer to Allegiant StadiumHowever overall room was horrible and clean and the air conditioner didn't work every time I called the front desk no one would answer I would have to walk down
20,Why would a hotel let dogs walk around? I stepped in Dog Crap in the walk way between Luxor and Excalibur along with several others. track the crap all down the hall nasty! Everything is way over priced there really is very little value. Why is the Hot tub not open? Cheap ownership. never again
50,I was happy I picked the Luxor! I was able to avoid that check-in line by checking in on the mobile app. The only issue I had was that the mobile key worked sometimes and sometimes it didn’t. Other than that everything was awesome!
40,Self check-in and check-out is a must do. Did not have to wait in line. Room was ready when I arrived . I download the app and was able to use digital key to get into room. Make sure you have the right room you reserved .
20,Hotel needs an upgrade. Stayed here about 20 years ago and was nice then but now not so much. Rooms are dated. Check in lines were very long. Hotel was not business friendly either as business center was closed and wireless was slow. Sent a package to the hotel and they had it sent back as the business center is no longer in operation. We got no apologies for the inconvenience just attitude from a lady at the bell desk via telephone and in person. Never had an issue receiving a package at a hotel before as long as I said c/o Guest. Only chose the Luxor because we were going to a football game and the hotel was in close proximity to the stadium and price seemed reasonable. Next time I would probably spend the extra and stay more central on the Strip.
30,The biggest problem I had at this hotel was the fact that the hot tub did not work (jets not blowing) the fact that the hot tub only sat 8 people (in a hotel with 20 floors?) and the 1/2 wall in the shower(the bathroom floor turned into a mini flood) and the fact that the pool closed at 6pm in a town that never sleeps.
20,Went to a Raiders game slept in a dungeon open my blinds to look at a block wall and construction storage tried to call the front desk no one responded on hold for a long time no shuttle to the airport even with a sign that says shuttle to the airport our room on a unsecured floor you could just walk off the floor right to our door gambled a lot never got one drink until a went to another casino over all not happy with my stay
50,The Luxor is a world class hotel with great amenities and helpful and friendly staff. The only issue (and it is not a huge issue) is that they no longer have a fridge in the room. The cleaning staff did an exceptional job and made sure the room was spotless and taken care of.
30,If you are looking for an OK place to sleep and don’t plan on hanging out in the casino this is the spot for you it did the job but didn’t turn any heads If you want to stay in a nicer hotel that provides a beautiful fiancée and I would suggest looking elsewhere..
10,Extremely long lines rude staff restaurants have limited hours with terrible waits I would recommend staying at a nice place on Fremont Street. Luxor is a great place to go if you like standing in long lines to check in or to try to go to a restaurant if you're lucky enough to get in between the limited hours they are open. Should you need to talk to someone on the phone regarding something good luck because wait times can be extremely long
50,We weren't smart enough to leave Luxor and go see fountains at Bellagio while game was going on. After Raiders game was over the taxi line was super long and it took us over an hour to get a Lyft and would've been longer to wait on cab.    Great place to stay but if you are there on home game day pay attention to your comings and goings.
50,The staff at the Luxor were very friendly and helpful. We had a girls trip and they made it a trip to remember. It would be great if there were a few more food options but overall it was great! Ready for the next time
20,The service here is terrible. The pool is heated only on weekdays because thy don't want you to stay at the pool when you can gamble at the casino. Service is poor. Inside the hotel and casino with a few exceptions. I would not recommend. The food is expensive at the food court.
20,Not all of the elevators worked a lot of them were broken and did not go to the floor we needed to check in we paid for early check-in and was not able to get it a housekeeper or someone use our bathroom when we were not there in the whole entire room smelt like poop we did not have any washcloths or towels I think because we got an extra room that had not been serviced yet or restocked.
40,I'll come back. The room was awesome tub felt great while winding down. I like using the app to check in and out made things way easier. It did take a bit to get my bearings so I knew how to navigate around the casino.
20,No in room coffee. Had to go to Starbucks and it wasn't open until 6am. Can't be an early riser here which is hard because the beds are uncomfortable. Pool and workout room are only open during normal business hours so when traveling for work can't use those either. Lastly all restaurants in the hotel were much more expensive than those in nearby hotels
50,Every time we visit Las Vegas rather it be for Business or pleasure we always stay at the Luxor. We have never been disappointed with the staff or rooms. The staff is always friendly and ready to help with whatever you want or need.
30,The rooms and casino appear old. Not many places to eat except fast food. The food we got at lunch that our company paid for to catered was awesome. Not only was the food awesome the service was just as good.
10,I will not be staying here again. Roaches found in bathroom and bedroom notified staff and took a long time for someone to come see and next day still had more roaches and they stated there was no other rooms available to change.
10,The hotel room is reminiscent of a cheap pay by the hour room. No thermostat only high medium or low so the room is either hot or cold. Heated pool was broken during our stay yet still paid a $200 resort fee. Elevator buttons missing numbers and written in with a sharpie. Elevator doors rocked back and forth while in motion. Bed was so uncomfortable that my back hurt for most of the trip and made it miserable walking around. Staff was very nice.
40,I had to go to Vegas for a conference. Again. I’ve been 30+ times. Not a huge fan of Vegas. I was never a fan of the Luxor either. However this was a much better experience. Cleaner more modern and a pleasant lack of that musty old hotel smell I remember from the last time I stayed at the Luxor.
10,This property was severely understaffed. Didn't get into our room till an hour and 15 minutes after we were told we were supposed to. Everything is just very old and dated. Elevators are falling apart literally. Paint coming off rooms. This hotel is just not taken care of at all.
40,We stayed at Luxor to attend a football game at allegiant stadium the walk from the hotel was quick.    One downside was the elevators they took forever to get one and get downstairs - one day we waited 20 minutes for one… with 4 being in service.
50,Stay was okay. The increase pricing for Bears game and fight was piling on. The Hotel was making money that weekend took advantage of consumers. Hotel was okay. My room did not have a refrigerator. Location was away from center part of the strip where most of the activity was at.
30,The overall Luxor hotel experience was great. The only problem I had was the room. There was cracked tiles in the bathroom and missing screws and broken magnets in the closet. The house keeping was very friendly and helped and cleaned the room nicely.
20,Nothing special here. Old. Resort needs brightening up and a deep cleaning!! Staff was nice but not worth spending over $100 a night. You pay for the location. Beds were ok but our sheets were a bit yucky. Bathroom was very outdated.
50,Iconic Hotel great service great facilities and great shows ... Blue Man Group Fantasy Carrot Top are all excellent !!! We also enjoyed the Human Body exhibit and the Titanic Exhibit. Box Office to other shows very very convenient!!!
40,I've never been place on the first Floor. In A hotel in Las Vegas! No view of anything! That was very disappointing. The dealers weren't that friendly either. I found that to be very disappointing....
30,...the elevators were a nightmare. It was like a roulette wheel where you would end up despite of headed up or down! Usually took 2-3 cars before one was empty enough even if we had no luggage. Therefore people would cram in by the dozen.    We were surprised to find no fridge or micro in the room. The tram was also not running at the Luxor stop not a big deal but the walk all the way through Mandalay Bay 5 or 6 times got tiring.    However we then discovered 1923 Prohibition Bar in the Mandalay. Best drinks of the weekend. $20 a pop including tip but worth it.
30,While I did enjoy my stay the cleaning could be a little bit better. There were plenty of things to do in the resort from gambling to dining out. The prices for things there were pretty expensive though. The pool area closed very early. Overall I think it was worth the price. I give it a 3.5.
10,Booked the Luxor for my wedding. Had a great experience with the Weddings by Mandalay Bay crew they were awesome. The venues at the Mandalay were everything positive about the trip Shark Reef Border Grill the Citizen. But the stay at the Luxor was the absolute WRONG choice. Room was not serviced daily had difficulty contacting anyone in guest services or housekeeping via phone the AC was broken and the room was over 90 degrees for several days of our stay. Our party booked 5 rooms and all 5 rooms had some type of issue. This place definitely focuses on the one only night party crowd. If you want to stay in a place that will be a positive and memorable experience DO Not stay at the Luxor. Awful
30,I just hope everyone my concerns about my review don't get me wrong the whole Luxor hotel is beautiful some staff was amazing some of the service can use some work and the bathroom could use some work the maintenance part of it the cleanliness real good
20,Just outdated and newer better hotels in the area. The outside looks really cool but the inside does not. I wouldn’t recommend to anyone I would recommend to go and walk through and see it. But not stay the night
10,Hotel was not what we expected. We waited so long to check in at 11pm. Room was not up to standard. Bathroom sink was clogged so as the the bath tub. Air conditioning is so loud like there’s a train inside our room. Only 3 pillows for a king size bed. Cannot talk to front desk or even mainline no one is answering
50,Would definitely come back with friends to enjoy more amenities of the hotel. Great service and friendly staff. Would like to thank the front desk for resolving my check in issue at the start but ended with a great get away.
50,We stayed at Luxor for our daughters wedding at Red Rock Canyon. The entire family stayed there. The hotel was very good to us and made our stay easier. They accommodate in every way possible from maintenance to parking.
50,The stay was nice the activities were nice and close the accessibility of food and shopping was nice as well  wish my room had a fridge and microwave gut all good  really really enjoyed my stay . I will be visiting with my family again soon so I will be happy to come and stay at the Luxor again .
30,Room was recently updated but poorly done. New carpet but furniture was from Bellagio. Hallways and casino floor have not been updated and is in need for some. Elevators were dirty. Only reason for staying here is the close walk to Allegiant Stadium
50,Clean room friendly staff and convenient location. Would absolutely stay here again on my next visit to Las Vegas. Only downfall is no refrigerator in the rooms but not a big deal! Plenty of eating and drinking options within the hotel also!
40,Luxor is a big place needs more tools to assist customers get around. More follow through with things that were discussed.like adjoining rooms. Staff is friendly and helpful.  Rooms are clean and stocked with the necessities.
50,"Easy check in. Tower west king room on 9th floor. Great chance at a beautiful view but they advertise ""blue man group"" on the windows and ruins the view. Gameday was great for location and fan interaction. Easy walk with access to surrounding casinos. Gooooo Chicago Bears!!😁"
10,The hotel was dirty and very outdated. The room looked like a motel 6 Room ! When I checked in my room was not ready and I waited 30 minutes to be told it wasn’t ready . The room was dirty and out dated. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone!
40,Enjoyable stay. Very nice room. Would recommend to family and friends. I would stay in the Luxor on my next trip. Easy to check in and out of hotel. Just a friendly environment. Staff was very friendly and helpful.
50,Staff is friendly Valet was worth every penny Tender steakhouse was superb! Clean room. Great views. Clean Casino. Plenty of amenities. Signs on everything made navigating through the Luxor very easy!
20,Room amenities were fairly non existent but staff was great and price was great. Was original told no fee for late check out but there was a late checkout fee. Not mad at the fee just bummed I wasn’t told that the first time we asked. No temp control for ac/heating unit in room and shower sprayed water every where on the floor
50,Stayed for 2 nights. Room was clean spacious. Bed and pillows were comfortable. Casino was clean with plenty of hand sanitizer stations. Food court has good options and was always easy and efficient.
30,elevators to get to rooms took forever and we were suppose to have rooms together. and when we made our reservations she was going to make us rooms for our group for Diablos cantina which she didnt either
40,Can’t beat the price. Close enough to the strip but without the craziness. Staff was super friendly. Able to play the machine you want. Only complaint is we wish the rooms had a coffee maker and fridge.
10,The rooms ac barley worked.  The shower had a constant drip. All day and all night. The shower didn't have a door so it soaked the entire floor each shower. Never will pick this hotel again. Plus for being one of the most expensive had no fridge or microwave
50,Newly renovated pyramid suites were great! Stay Well room was very relaxing. Came for Raiders game and although they were fully booked great service! Highly recommend for any nearby activities as easy and safe access.
40,We stayed in luxor for a couple nights. The first night they were over booked so they gave us a double queen room. However the next day we were able to switch to a king room. I Didn’t know that they had fees for some amenities. They do charge $25 to have a mini fridge in the room. Both of our mini fridges as we switched rooms so had to get us a different fridge but only one time charge we’re broken on the inner door side. Parking is $15 a night which they can add onto your bill which I thought was great. They do you have the option to have a late check out for a fee which we took advantage of ($10 12pm $20 1pm $30 3pm) We chose the 3 PM option is we went to Vegas for a friends wedding the night before our check out day.
10,Our room was disgusting we got stuck in the elevator for over an hour and only refunded for the $30 resort fee for that day. The line to check in was a 30+ min wait and 30 min wait to check out. I would never stay here again.
20,I wouldn’t recommend the rooms. It’s nothing like the pic. Not what I expected at all. The hotel offered a lot of restaurants and the spa was amazing. I just wish they took better care of the rooms. Sad.
40,Wish they had a mini fridge... overall satisfied with the room. We went with other friends and we asked to get conjoined rooms and they were nice enough to upgrade us. This made a big difference in our trip!
10,The hotel is in desperate need to updating. The elevators and turtle slow and after waiting to 10 minutes they stop at your floor and are already full so you have to wait for the next one. The room are vintage 1990 and badly need renovation. No fridge no microwave. Room smelled like smoke masked with spray. Basically cheap motel quality accommodations.
50,Our room was perfect for the week we spent in Vegas. The Luxor was clean quiet comfortable and accommodating to our needs. Great restaurants within the walls of the Luxor. Will Book a Room again at the Luxor on our next visit to Vegas!
50,No need to hit OVERPRICED HOTELS on the Vegas Strip when you can stay at The Luxor and enjoy it and the amenities while gambling drinking and relaxing. This is the PLACE for those who Like LUXURY on a budget without it being “NO-FRILLS”.    Great Trip! Great Stay!! SEE YOU IN A FEW WEEKS!!!!!
50,From beginning to end everything was perfect. The staff are friendly and respectful while also making sure that you are happy with the rooms and service in all areas of the hotel and casino. If there is even a small issue they will address it immediately without question or conflict.
50,Room was clean and quiet; even across from elevator. Felt safe at all times. Great location and easy access to Mandalay Bay Excalibur Mgm grand in n out decent pool great photo ops quality restaurants gaming if that’s your thing.
20,It is very old smells bad problems to take the elevator if you are using the app I got a room with no view just a wall when you open the curtains. Nothing good to say. It was probably good in the 80'.
10,This hotel was very poor value for price. Rooms were poor quality. Poor check in experience and difficult to ask without waiting in long line. Location was nice and neat to be staying in a pyramid until you realize it’s not all that’s it’s cracked out to be.
10,The experience was terrible we spent 4 days of terror in this hotel from October 2 to October 6 2021. The day we arrived the room that they gave us 4240 west wing was not clean we arrived at 12 at night and we had to wait about 1 hour to be cleaned because there was supposedly no other to give us. We slept there since we were super tired the next day we understood why the room was dirty it was that a sewage pipe had broken and I assume that the previous guests requested a change of room. We talked to change the room since we would not sleep any other day in that rotten smell fortunately they moved us to room 12215 for the remaining three nights but our nightmare did not end here one of the days we reported around 11pm the television did not work and maintenance person showed up at 12:50; of course we were already asleep and I told him it would be for later because we were already asleep. The last night we asked the house keeping to please make the room and they didn't I had to call so they could at least give me clean towels.  I had really stayed in other opportunities at the Luxor and the experience was very good it is a shame that the hotel has lost so much category and customer service.  JZ
30,Bedding subpar.  Bathrooms have hard water/rust/mildew stains.  Rooms are musty.  This was my first time to Vegas and I would not choose to stay here again.  I have had better experiences at Holiday Inns.
20,The room looked really old  no fridge i booked a premier king pyramid room. But it was a disappointment .. only one pool was open and it didnt look that clean… it was not my first time staying here but it was the worst
20,Rooms were old and dirty elevators were dirty and not all working. Paid for early check in only to find no rooms available. Paid for multiple rooms and wanted them close and they couldn’t accommodate that either.
50,The title says it all. If you stay here you will feel like the most important person there!! The staff was friendly helpful and seemed to truly care about us. And that just meant so much to myself & my family. We WILL be back!!
10,The elevators didn’t work on the 10th floor and once you walk out on the 10th floor there’s cracked tile which looks like they put black tape on it so you wouldn’t trip but it’s old so people looked like they were about to trip over it. The room looked dirty with brown stains on the sheets
10,Room was not attended to for two days in a row and had to call for towels. Shower sends water out the door and all over the floor. TV comes on full blast when you turn it on. Very dated. Parking is an outrageous $15 a day and no comp for guests. Very disappointed in the Luxor. There are far better places to stay.
30,Place has changed a lot over the years. Only other casino we were happy we weren’t staying at was Excalibur. Also the cost of everything inside the hotel was ridiculous. Vodka soda at the bar was $18 and a larger water bottle was $6.
10,I recently booked two rooms for five nights at Luxor. They charged me two resort fees which I pain in good faith. However half the pools were closed and the other half were unheated and unbearably cold and unable to be used. Several guests and I discussed this and agreed the hotel had ripped us off. Furthermore my bathroom wall had two gaping holes in the wall and my mattress slanted downward on the left side which led to some minor back/hip pain the next day.
30,Stay in the Tower Suites if you stay here otherwise there are better properties. It still feels old and run down. The staff was friendly and we had no problems at all but prefer Vdara and Aria.    This may sound a little bit of a snotty review...it is. When I Vegas I just want a little more top shelf than Luxor could provide.
40,Had to last-minute find lodging at the Luxor to work an event at the Mandalay Bay when my original lodging plans fell through. While the MGM online reservations site was less-than-helpful the front desk staff at the Luxor are very polite and quick-thinking. For all the activity in the Luxor internal pyramid (casino theatre crowds restaurants live music) the rooms are remarkable soundproof and comfortable.
50,"We had a great stay at the Luxor. Staff was friendly and helped get us quickly checked in seamlessly smooth. Didn't see any ""ghosts"" but still had a great time. I've had great experiences with MGM resorts hotels. Will recommend staying at one to anyone that inquires."
10,Digital keys don't work. If you want to avoid the long lines do the mobile check-in and get a key from the mobile kiosks to the right of the lines for registration.    Our room was an oven when we got there. Nearly 80F and it was after sunset. Hotter in the room than outside.    Wifi is god awful. everywhere    Put in a mobile order at starbucks. Took nearly an hour before it was ready. Seriously?    I could go on but that should be enough to convince you to stay somewhere else
50,Very busy casino. Many options to pick from. Easy access to cabs. Easy access to many places 2 eat. Many machines 2 gamble on. Lots of card tables but no progressive on 3 Card poker. Great lace to stay. Pool is also great!
10,Place is very dated and old. Moldy carpet broken AC shaky elevators that work on occasion overpriced food and slots for the casual player. If you want to have a fun trip with friends pick another hotel.
20,Long lines and limited table games. Food was okay but the public house manager Patrick B. was less than desired. The ribeye was not good. Overall they needed more workers to offer a better experience. If you need to pay more to get more workers then that is what is needed. The customer who foots the bill shouldn't get subpar service too.
50,I really enjoyed my time at the Luxor. Booking was quick and easy. Checking in was even easier. The hotel is right on the edge of the strip. Room was clean and hotel was nice and clean too. Will definitely stay here again.
30,I don’t understand why housekeeping felt the need to bang on our door at 8:30 AM both days when check out isn’t even until 11:00 AM. They barged into our room after knocking once and then apologized when they figured out there were people in the room. This is unprofessional and unacceptable! But the staff at the front desk are amazingly friendly and accommodating.
20,Luxor stay the heater from the room was not working the shower door only have was there the other half was missing all the ways splash to the bathroom floor that is a safety issue electric flat walkways not working
50,The property has some unique things in the interior. The food places are great. The pool is a great place to relax. The rooms are nice and the staff is very good. Connected to the Excalibur and Mandalay Bay don't even have to go outside.
40,The checkin process is fabulous. Digital checkin is so easy. Restroom shut down in casino floor. Food good. The inclinator is slow and not all are working in an area. People waiting for several passes to get a ride.
50,Sleep well and fresh smelling parking was free too service was prompt clean view was amazing easy to get around my overall experience in los vegas was truly pleasant with my family and friends all was well thank you for the experience there at the Luxor hotel
50,This was are first visit to Vegas and we celebrate our anniversary together and we enjoyed very much thank you for your service we really loved also was my husband birthday and we did many things around
10,Hotel and staff are both straight up disgusting. Elite suite looked like a crack den. Place filthy. Walls crumbling. Stains everywhereeee. This isn’t the pyramid it’s the projects. Rickety grimey and stankin.
20,Tried to save money and won’t do that again! Hotel room was gross! Glitter and finger nails on the floor! Sink dripped the whole time! And the cold water didn’t work! Staff were nice. Casino teller took my money but the lady who helped me was very nice and resolved it right away
10,The standard room was extremely uncomfortable and outdated. The pool was not comfortable and no shaded areas were available for free.    Every part of the room was in need of updating! For a price of $350 for two nights you cant call this a 4 star hotel.
10,This place is awful. I have never stayed a hotel that was this run down the rooms are crappy elevator sucks. We were so excited to go to raiders game and say here now we are all sick from smoke and mold.
40,Mommy overall stay was very nice I had some issues with my room such as the sinks being clogged a part of the TV In the master was broken and the lack of hot water in the master suite but for the price I would stay again
50,This was our first trip to Vegas. Everyone was friendly and helpful while we were there. We even decided after 10 years together to get married in Vegas. We just returned home yesterday and I am already looking to book through MGM again. I can't wait to go back.
20,Room wasn’t the best condition cleaning wise and appealing.  Definitely needs to be upgraded and Fumigated for roaches. Didn’t let me connect my appletv due to some dumb reasons and the channels were trash.
10,Room was way outdated tacks coming through the carpet at spots. Couldnt get housekeeping to restock bathroom items once during our trip. Front desk did nothing to fix the situation. Will never stay here again
30,We stayed at the Luxor because we were there to see the Blue Man Group. The room was spacious and the staff was exceptional. The bathroom sink was plugged and there was a part of the carpet that was damp. Also the shower had an opening of about 2.5 feet so water got into the bathroom floor.
50,years past we stop staying because the casino and rooms were run down looking and no one seemed happy to be there or help. Wife got  a deal so we figured we'd give it another shot. this time it was a totally different experience. cant wait to come back!!
20,If all you go for is the casino it’s a tolerable place to stay. But beware long lines for check in limited dinning after mid-afternoon old run down rooms. Take an Uber or Lyft because though there is parking it’s another $15 per day. Tack all the tax parking  resort fees and more and you nightly rate is the first big loss of your trip
50,Loved the suite and experience was great will be coming back soon. Had the staff clean the room well and everything was well organized the entire room was spot clean and loved the experience I had in the casinos.
50,Room was clean. Workers were very nice and location is perfect. Casino was clean. Just needed more staff waitresses because it took a minute to get a drink while you are playing but other than that I will come back
40,I’d say for the value it wasn’t a bad at all great experience I’d definitely recommend and go again if your single this is the city for you but if your a couple even better just don’t try to go single when your in a relationship
50,The Luxor was a pleasant stay and it’s beautiful. I love the Egyptian style of the building. There are many stores and places to eat and drink. The bell service and housekeeping folks were very friendly.
30,The Luxor has fallen off a bit since the beginning of the pandemic. Stood in the East tower. The bathroom had a strange smell to it everytime we would walk in to the room because the room entrance was right next to it. On the first floor in the hallway on our way to our room we noticed the wall paper ripped out that was a bit of an eye sore walking past it. The real let down was the quality of the buffet food it felt like the food was left out there for awhile where before the Luxor had the best cheap buffet on the strip it has now become the worst buffet on the strip. All the food had the taste of it being dry and left out there for some time. Also the bar areas had small gnats flying around them as well that is the first time I had ever experienced having gnats flying around me in a Las Vegas casino bar. Maybe it was a one time thing this time around. I will give the Luxor another chance.
10,The hotel was so horrible I will definitely never stay there again. The sink and tub would not drain properly and the toilet wouldn’t flush correctly. The window in the room was so dirty I could barely see out of it. The room had a place for a refrigerator but the refrigerator was removed leaving an empty place. When I went to get ice from down the hall I discovered there was no ice bucket. The hot tub was 100% disgusting and only had one sad jet that barely worked. On a scale of 1-10 I would give this hotel a 2
50,Our room was located on the west tower. The room was clean and vest of all the mattress was extremely comfortable. We were upgraded to a premium room at no charge with a king size bed. The staff are friendly/helpful. I will stay here again and recommend anyone to do so!
10,Cheap hotel poor service no 24hr room service. Little to no interaction with staff. If you have to stay here do it but plenty of other better maintained casinos around. I would not recommend staying here.
50,Luxor has a nice Egyptian history construction good service nice rooms to sleep very nice swimming pools good restaurants with great foods good parking good security and nice machines to play and get nice drinks to enjoy .
50,The Luxor is a great place to stay on the strip. Great rooms with comfy beds. Within minutes of everything driving and very close.to several casinos for walking. I love the Luxor and will choose again
40,The hotel is beautiful. We are not gamblers so we did not use the casino but went to the Titanic exhibit which was very good. Beware - valet parking is $26 until midnight and then it starts over again. So the charge for one day is $52.
30,This stay would’ve been much better if the the bathroom was clean sheets did not have stains and the check in desk was nicer. Other than the location was great and the bed. Wish the casino was none smoking. I could barely breath.
10,The building and rooms are in bad shape. The exterior looked like a frat house with Bud sticker on side and eye patch on Sphinx. Tub leaked 3 clothes hangers 3 small pillows for king sized bed and room in bad shape definitely not the picture on MGM resorts/M rewards site. Walked by a dirty Q tip laying by our door every day. NOT the place to stay for a 25th Wedding Anniversary. We have stayed in Super 8s Redroofs and ma and pa type hotels/motels in better shape and quality.
50,What a birthday I had complements to Myriam Witchev an employee at Luxor Casino. A beautiful spirit with an equally caring soul I hope see makes supervisor she is glorious and amazingly accommodating I absolutely love her.
50,Convenient location for convention at Mandalay. Great staff room and accomodations. I would definitely stay there again. Unique design makes stay unlike any other. Great food and entertainment options as well.
10,I arrived to a pile of trash in front of the door the room had clearly not been cleaned in days; the sink was dirty the dresser top had something sticky on it the carpet was dirty and a light fixture was dangerously broken. And the next day the room wasn't made up.
20,Be prepared to wait a really long time to check in be charged extra fees have a subpar room (if you have multiple rooms be ready for them to be different) be kept up all night (either from the horribly uncomfortable pillows or beds or the noisy ass neighbors that security won't do anything about) and pay way too much for crappy food. But if you bring all your own food or go elsewhere for it don't need to sleep more than 2 hours a night and spend all your time at the pool or the spa your stay will be just fine.
50,Clean room friendly staff fun gaming. I checked in and out online and it was very easy I enjoyed not having to stand in line. I liked that I was not able to hear any noise from the casino while in my room.
20,Stuck in elevator 3 different times due to cards not works staff didn't care and made me wait on line again to fix their error. Casino staff energy sucks they get happy when you lose. They'll do little things to throw your concentration.
20,If they give you a room on the bottom floor. Move to a different hotel. They have no security to keep your night satisfied we had some drunk bang on our door to the point of scaring my wife and myself to never stay here again
20,The hotel room needs to be updated. The tv could barely be seen from the bed. The hotel is not centrally located. The tub was nice but I misread and thought it was a jetted tub but wasn't. It would have been better if it was. Make sure you read the find print.
10,"You honestly get what you pay for a cheap ""luxury"" hotel. If we would have known it would be a basic hotel room we would have never booked here. There was no fridge or microwave in the room the bathroom was filthy the ac struggled to work the walls were paper thin the room was overall disappointing. This place is so hard to navigate getting to parking and even getting to the room. Shops/restaurants and shows were not open when we walked around before 10pm only thing available to do was go to the casino. Our stay at this hotel was just overall disappointing and we will not be booking again or recommending to anyone. Just do yourself a favor and pay a little more for a better place to stay in Vegas."
10,Camping in a tent would be better than the Luxor. From check in to the rooms to the service they do not get it. It’s dirty. This has become a cut rate hotel serving the hillbilly crowd. A real bad experience!
10,Terrible experience room was dirty. I couldn’t stop sneezing. Elevator sound like it was about break. The vibes were creepy. Went to buy food at Nathan’s the staff had a bad attitude. I wouldn’t suggest anyone to stay here.
50,If you join MLife they offer many free nights throughout the year. You still have to pay tax and resort fee but it is a bargain. I have stayed at this hotel many times and it is always a great experience. The location is good and there are many food options either in the hotel or a short walk through to Excalibur or Mandalay.
40,The room was nice except there was no fridge or coffee maker. Could be due to a Covid restriction but it was a bit of a surprise. The Luxor décor is still one of the best on the strip. The restaurant options are decent and the local show options are good too.
20,It was my first time staying in the Luxor hotel & casino. I was staying in the east tower of the Luxor property. The pictures that are displayed on their gallery are very promising until you get to the hotel room. I noticed little details that makes me think this is not what I expected it to be (broken light switch hard mattresses n so on.)    For the staffs it a hit or Miss for running into people that likes to help or vice versa.    I am more dissatisfied in the room compare to the staffs because I only run into them when I checked in.
50,I love the Luxor. The rooms were nice and clean. I love the Mexican restaurant and it’s in a convenient location to walk to other hotels shows shops and attractions. I had an amazing time. Will be back soon!
50,Beautiful place to stay very nice clean rooms loved the view. A memory I will never forget. Truly blessed to say the least. If you are in Vegas go check them out they also have great rewards worth the trip
30,This is a good budget hotel but was disappointed with 20-25.00 craps tables. These should have been 10-15 at most for the type of players that are choosing this resort over some of the center strip resorts
50,Room was very nice and extremely clean. Casino floor & restaurants were also very nice. We only had a one night stay but I would definitely return to the Luxor. Although the registration area was crowded the staff was very courteous and helpful.
40,I loved the mobile app check in process and digital key. I didn't have to wait in a long line to check in and get keys it was all done on the mobile app. Once my room was ready I was alerted and went straight to it opened the door via my phone and never had to deal with the check in lines. The room was large clean and the shower head was very strong.
50,We stayed in a tower one bedroom suite. It was very clean and roomy. The pool was nice and the limit s staff kept up very well. Everyone was nice. The casino was clean and everyone we came across seemed to be having a great time as well. We will be back in October 2022 for the Shamrock series ND vs BYU at Allegiant stadium and will stay at Luxor again.
50,Check could not be any better tried to checked in early and the man at the desk went out of his way to get us a room. Not only did he get us a room but also the other room we reserved Both rooms on same floor👍
50,Terrific value for a clean room with amenities. Enjoyed my experience at Luxor and did take walks to Excalibur and Mandalay Bay. I will visit Luxor again and will recommend it to friends. The proximity to the stadium is another benefit of this resort.
50,Love staying at the Luxor. This was my 3rd time staying here and will definitely be back again soon!!! Got to enjoy the pool area this last time and will always stop and eat at Diablo's cantina at least once during my stay!
50,I found Luxor to be a great hotel on the south end of the strip. It was my 1st time to Vegas and got a room in the east tower which was very nice. While there are parts of the hotel that look slightly dated the room was extremely nice. The soaking tub was a welcome touch as was the separate shower. The beds were amazing. Probably the best mattress I've slept on in a long time. The hotel wasn't extremely busy which was a plus. Pyramid Cafe was very nice while Public House wasn't worth the money. Front Desk and Mlife staff were very helpful as my account had a couple issues. The dealer at the Roulette table was extremely patient with me learning. The Sports betting was mostly great with one exception. One lady working the counter was extremely rude over a misunderstanding on my part over drink tickets. Overall I would happily recommend the Hotel to others and would likely stay there again. It is a bit on the south end of the strip so you will likely walk or want to get an uber rental car or taxi if doing things off site.
40,We enjoyed our stay at the Luxor. The room was spacious but a bit worn out. There were not many restaurants open but the steakhouse and mexican restaurant were good. The buffet was the worst one I had been to. Check in and out was really nice...Everything could be done on the app.
50,Thank y’all for being so accommodating to Iowa State cyclone fan base! Besides the rough tailgate with warm beer it was overall a great experience! Wish all the pools were open that weekend though……..
50,I organized a girls trip for about 10 girls. I chose Luxor because it was within everyone’s budget range.    I wanted a central place for everyone to hangout and booked the 2 bedroom Tower suite plus 3 Tower rooms.    I was pleasantly surprised upon arrival that they had all of the rooms including the suite on the same floor! Because the elevators only goes to the floor your room key is for having everyone on the same floor made it super convenient.    Additionally everyone really enjoyed the proximity of the Luxor as most of the things we did were at Mandalay Bay MGM or in the hotel.    A nice plus was the Deli that was open late when we were hungry.    I highly recommend Luxor for group stays.
50,I loved the hotel so much it was so fun to have the experience of staying there. I would recommend staying here for people that want to have great places to eat and spend time with family it is a nice hotel
50,Always a pleasure my favorite hotel in Vegas can’t wait to go back. They let us check in early and out late at no cost and held our bags until we flew out. Highly recommend this place you won’t regret it.
10,So ever stay there or any MGM property in Vegas.  See the comments at the beginning my complaints are clearly listed and I have pictures of all the comments I made.  The Luxor made me and my wife feel like second class people.
10,Check-in was a nightmare took over an hour since the electronic check-in did not work; the room (a 1-bedroom suite) was shabby old and very basic; staff was nonexistent to ask questions; 15 minutes on hold just to find out where the gym was (the gym was nice the sole bright spot of the property).
50,Omggggggg I loved it from the start to the finish it was my best trip ever….. the room were super clean n also my favorite part is fresh towels morning and night… definitely will be back with my husband
20,Way under staffed  Rooms smell like mildew  Too many old slot machines  Every line in the resort is long with too few workers (from check in to M life and any other area!) security staff has no curtesy and little to no customer service mentality or training. NOTE: Management does not care about you your preferences or respect you as a paying customer - you are ONLY a number a body to be tolerated and dismissed. Apparently this is the mentality for the owner and senior management staff on down!!!!
30,No microwave or fridge to heat things up or keep drinks cool. The smell of marijuana was awful. The maintenance guy left our sink nasty after water came up through it from the room next doors and didn’t even attempt to clean it.
30,The maintenance of the rooms have not been kept up to date. Decent deals on the rooms but their prices on food and drinks are too high for the what you're getting. Perhaps it's time to start staying somewhere else.
50,Luxor gave me the best customer service in Las Vegas ever ! Scott took care of my family and me ! Will definitely go back and stay there again . Overall experience was 10/10 . I’m looking forward to going again in New Years
50,Luxor room was big and nice super friendly staff. This hotel has so much to offer and what's great is its connected to 2 other hotels so lots to do from gambling to shopping and eating to just taking a walk. Find the hidden Cool Bar Probations up in the mall area. best eats in the place was the Deli everything made to order these chefs do it up right and its reasonable cost. Blue man Group is good if you haven't caught this show yet. The Bar across from check in is chill. The pool area is nice its big. NFL football Raiders Stadium right in the back as well for all you fans...also you can walk out side catch the FREE monorail is cool goes to the Mandolin Bay hotel to New York hotel. If you cross the bridge over to the MGM you can go in and pay for the day or 2 day pass to use the other Monorail that gets you up and down the strip pretty cheap and cool. Enjoy your stay!!!
20,"You can do better elsewhere    I got one of their ""premier"" rooms and the best part about it was that is was atheist quiet. Small room empty hole where the mini-fridge/safe should have been elevator keys not working elevator call button shoved into wall extra hidden charges at checking and one bar where each bartender charged me a different price for the exact same drink."
50,For being a hotel several decades old the room was clean spacious comfortable. The AC was working way better than most hotels. My King Suite even served as a meeting space for colleagues who needed quiet to present.
50,Because we only had 24 hours to be in Las Vegas it was important that we were able to get a guaranteed early check-in and late check-out due to flight times We got exactly what we booked at Luxor . We had a beautiful room on the top floor and had an amazing time. The staff we encountered were all friendly and the steakhouse at Luxor was absolutely amazing
20,Overall awful experience. Everything was too expensive. From the food to tickets to alcohol.The service was awful the whole experience was bad. I will not be coming back to the Luxor. I regret spending my money here.
50,Beautiful hotel in a wonderful location. The property stayed clean and staff was nice and friendly. The price of rooms are more than reasonable. Additionally there is a wide variety of food options that is suitable for different budget levels.
10,The contactless checkin checkout self parking and digital key was awesome. The rest of the stay sucked. Room was dirty the remote control did not work maintenance never came the room was freezing and the heater did not work. The view of the structure in from of the room next to the floor was dirty and disgusting. You can tell this place does the bare minimum to check a room off. I would not recommend this place to anyone one I know.
50,Rooms were great. Beds were very comfortable. Pool area is awesome! Staff are very helpful. Nice location at end of strip and next to other great properties. Food was great at the three places we ate at during our stay at Luxor The Cafe The Buffet and the Public House.
40,We upgraded our room at check in. We had a corner soaking tub room that was very nice. The bed was very comfortable. The water pressure wasn’t great and we had one day of a cold shower…but I would stay there again
30,The Luxor is nice in the Casino floor and even though some rooms have been remodeled they still feel old. The moving walk ways and the tram were not working. We were told we had food and drink credit but hotel staff could not tell us how to use it.
10,After booking a trip to Vegas for my husband's 35th birthday I decided to book him a day of pampering for the actual day of his birthday. I scheduled us massages at the hotel first thing in the morning and then booked $150 lounge bed for us that we were told was supposed to come with a personal host a bucket of waters etc. The day before our massages they called and told us to come early so we can enjoy the steam room and sauna that was included with the massages. As my husband was really excited to do this we got there early and my husband was told the steam room and sauna we're out of order and and not working on the men's side. Slightly disappointed we got our massages and then went to lay by the pool. We checked in and our host showed us to our lounge bed and disappeared for the rest of the day never to see him again. After sitting there for several hours a different host came by to empty our bucket of now water and replace the ice and at that time I mention to her that we were really disappointed and felt like we are being ignored as that the group several lounge chairs in front of us have been served several times since we had been there and we had not once had a server ask if we needed Anything. She told us the hosts were completely different then the servers and they had nothing to do with the serving and if she saw her she would send her our way and that they're usually just slow. We sat there for about another hour and a half and finally went and got our own drinks and then another hour and a half past then we went and got our own food. Never did we see a server the whole day we were there. Also Not to mention we were handed a receipt as soon as we got to the pool to sign and approve the charge for the lounge bed along with any said tip for the host. Not knowing how our experience was going to go or even that the host is separate from the server I gave a generous tip and they wanted it back right away. It was all the biggest waste of money and such a disappointment.  The Hotel Seemed very dirty and not kept up on maintenance at all. A lot of the restaurant booths were torn and or had duck tape all over them including the fancy steakhouse we ate at the first night that scratch the back of my thighs all night because the booths were all torn up. Not sure how you have a daily hotel fee but nothing looks like it's been maintained since it was built in the 90's.
30,Been coming to the Luxor many times over the years..definitely a decline overall..but not worth not staying there..because of value..if looking for luxury..this is not the place..suite rooms need an upgrade..
30,Overall my rating is average: my stay was not exceptional and it was not terrible. I did experience some customer service support issues because of the time a checked in. I understand it was busy but I did not like the attitude I received. The room was clean and cozy. Food was great at the Diablo restaurant. Overall experience is 3.75/5
20,Many things were average about my stay but a few things seemed weird/ out of place. The elevators to the rooms were slow and a little shakier than they needed to be. A few of them had mildly dented doors. Idk if it's a normal thing but they no longer provide a mini-fridge complimentary. It's now $28/night. Also you have to pay for parking (free for military).  Shows were good and reasonably priced and were available a night before the event/ earlier that same day. They were not empty but nearly sold out. Military discounts there too.
10,First impressions are normally what counts right? Well it was the worst I have been treated in lv I was diving a Winnebago with a 85 year olda disabled veteran and my sister on crutches after major surgery. I was yelled at 3times to move to a different location at the entrance which I did and I could not let my family off and we did have handicap 2 stickers but I don’t use the unless it’s a long way to walk and I toldjoethat and I let off my group. And got yelled at again but kept my cool and just ignored him the Lexie has no oversized parking and your forced to park at Excalibur. And walk back after driving all day long . I have vip status and it still took about an hour to check in at midnight the elevator door way had a margarita spill on floor and inside ya Mercer was cleaned up on ore 3 day stay the magic carpets were all broken to the three people in our group was left stranded and I’m not talking wheelchair bound but this weekend was a little different rooms were a mess and service on casino floor was the worst I spoke to a manager and he listened but I don’t know if he heard ps this is the first time I have complained any where and I hope I didn’t sound like I do this just venting because I go to Las Vegas a lot
40,Excellent staff they go out of their way to accommodate. Also decent shows and attractions on property. Pool are nice and you could spend all day at them. Luxor also has cool architecture - although the inclinators take a little getting used to.
40,We had a crying baby next door that did not let us sleep. We were in a handicap room. I was over charged and a week later I have not received my refund. It was nice but I hope next time you can provide what I booked for return my refund in a timely manner
20,I saw that Luxor completed a room renovation recently and I was excited to see what they did to update the pyramid rooms. Luxor was a fave of younger me (because how fun is it to stay in a pyramid?!) but adult me has never been a fan.    This year’s stay was a comp night from MLife from some gaming earlier this year so I figured I’d give Luxor another shot and check out the remodel. I can sum up my stay with one word: “meh.” The rooms got a coat of paint and some hand-me-down “new” furnishings from Bellagio but other than that the rooms are still the same tired worn-down offerings it’s had for years. The popcorn ceilings and yellowed electric switches and outlets matched the old toilet and old curtains (that may have come from an ancient Egyptian pyramid come to think of it). The rooms in the pyramid are a trek to get to if not right by the inclinator service was sub-par and the parking situation is horrific (if you’re going to charge for parking in addition to resort fees at least let it be in a decent updated structure).    OH! And whoever decided to put in the weird half-glass shower doors needs to find a new career. Water. Everywhere.    Dining options at Luxor are severely lacking. McDonalds used to be its best outlet and even that is gone. The staff I encountered (though limited thanks to online check-in and mobile keys) were all kind but most were happy to say how employment with MGM isn’t great lately.    The only redeeming qualities about Luxor are the tower rooms (always a solid choice…though still just okay) and it’s connection to Mandalay Bay. Do yourself a favor and stay at Linq Bally’s or even NYNY for a similar price.
10,Both rooms were dirty. First room had a dirty old sock around the fire sprinkler second room had a bag from a pervious guest with a horrendous smell the bathroom had old dried up urine around the toilet. The bellman was extremely rude and checkin was horrible
10,I never Have been the type of person to go and tell my friends and family not to stay at a resort or hotel based on experience. However this experience at the Luxor was just that bad I have told all my friends who travel to Vegas often to never even consider staying at Luxor. The front desk experience started it and the room standards were the worst.
10,As stated before my stay here was very unpleasant i was practically robbed and a victim of thievery from one of your staff i had multiple witness attempting to speak of the injustices that i experienced from your staff yet it all fell on deaf ears and i was victimized even further.
50,Even during the Pandemic I have gotten 3 stays in. Never disappointed.. Clean! Great Food Libations Housekeeping. People use your MLIFE CARD! My favorite place to stay! Always feel safe and well taken care of. My secret Solo getaway…. Best pools! Dining! Great staff!
50,I have no complaints overall experience was great. Housekeeping did a good job the room was clean and updated. When I called down to the desk for additional towels they were very prompt and came right away. I would stay again.. Absolutely no complaints
50,So pretty. Just a great overall Vegas experience all is one place! Even the cleaning staff greeted us throughout the. Online check in and easy check out me this stay so easy. Recommend Luxor for all especially for your first time visit!
50,Luxor is hands down a good bang for your buck. Worth it! Stayed with my family for four nights. The food was good hotel services were all on point. Great access point to be able to do trips so you won’t get all the traffic on the strip.
20,My stay at the luxor had to be one of the worst stays at a MGM hotel I have ever had...I should have booked the stay with my host rick koslowski who bnb is an exceptional host and manager at the MGM locations I met him at Mandalay bay...I wish he or another host could make my stay better the next time I visit...I definitely would not have come out of pocket for this trip...if I would have known it was going to be like that I would have paid...I would not have taken a horrible comp offer like that...
20,"Bed sheets had stains on them and room looked like it had not been used in awhile. ""Newly renovated"" bathrooms were so weird and did not make sense. Only had one door and strong shower head so water kept over flowing and running over onto the bathroom floor! My Mom slipped and almost fell when she got out the first night. Called guest service and they were not very helpful. Said they could not change our room due to being booked and for us to call back next day at 12pm. They sent someone to give us a shower mat! By 2nd night bathroom smelled due wet towels from shower. They did not c/b to see how my mom was doing and whether we still needed another room. Nothing. Very poor customer service in my opinion"
10,Advertise tables games they don't even have broken vending machines throughout the place A/C units won't keep the room cool when it's only 88 outside hotel staff coming into the room to half clean the room even with a Do Not Disturb sign on the door
40,Good hotel especially for the price point.  All the staff was friendly and efficient. Good food and vendors.  Bathroom didn’t have any towel racks.  Nice shower and hot water.  Air conditioning worked well.
50,Very nicely remodeled room very clean with a firm bed. Had a great stay. housekeeping came everyday and did a great job!!!!!. Hotel food and drink was wonderful. Also walk ramp to Excalibur for a change in food court. Will come back to stay again
30,The issues that we had were with the room. Front desk did not tell us the issues with construction. They also did not make us aware after saying if we called the next day that it still would not be fixed. The sink in the room did not drain very well either.
30,Customer service was pathetic  they did not receive a single call during the whole stay . Also the room we got previously was dirty . Flooring was messy . But we were helped with that and got a new room . That was appreciating. Overall the stay was good but the customer service.
10,Upon arrival room had 1 bar of soap and lotion. No shampoo/conditioner. The shower had a half glass wall and the water flooded the floor in the bathroom to the point all the towels we had couldn’t soak up the water. The drain was clogged so bad in the shower that I was standing in 2 inches of water. Suntan lotion scum was so bad on top of the water that the lifeguard had to skim the water as best she could with a towel. I wouldn’t stay here again. My friend’s room had no blow dryer and when she called housekeeping no one showed up with it and she had had to come to dinner with a wet head. Unless you are broke don’t stay here.
50,Had an issue with the sink the first night. Was very frustrated the second day when I called at 8am noon then 4pm to come find out the request was never put in to get fixed. Spoke with a manager downstairs and was upgraded to a suite to accommodate. Also had an emergency and to leave early one day. Also had Room Fees removed at Check-out. Great customer service to turn things around from a bad to good experience. Truly appreciative towards the accommodations. Will definitely be back.
10,I did not like the smell that there were in most places many people smoking all kinds of cigarettes and even toxic substances they should forbid that in the hotel and look for an area for those people even in the rooms they have those smells is I am very disappointed and I did not like
20,The worst hotel on the strip. Dilapidated rude staff and gross. Spend the extra money to do better. Gambling and restaurant staff is okay. But the rooms are just terrible. Jail blankets. Stale sheets. Old pillows. No amenities. Just not worth it
30,The hotel was nice. Room was tidy clean and well set up. But the carpet in our room was completely soaked. Not just damp but very wet. We had to wear shoes while in the room. Also not very good food options in the hotel in general.
40,We stayed on the 21st in a corner room the layout was nice but everything was dated like it hadn’t been changed for 40 years. The app check in was great though I liked not having to go to the desk or stand in line. Also the room key on the phone was great When the WiFi worked.
50,The whole trip was amazing and the hotel was in the perfect location. The location was perfect walking distance from everything. The rooms were clean and the staff were extremely helpful willing to accommodate all the needs of the guests. Would recommend to anybody and would definitely stay there again.
30,Stayed 3 nights as a couple. No enclosure for the shower meaning water ended up on the bathroom floor. Would have been nice to have had a mini fridge in the room. Lastly the tv comes on too loud regardless to what you had lowered the volume to previously. The buffet was delicious!
20,The hotel room was outdated. There were hairs all in the bathtub shower and sink. Hairs from someone shaving which is extremely unsanitary. There was a beer bottle cap on our couch from the previous guests. The bed was uncomfortable and the “blanket” provided was a thin sheet. The air tumbled when turning on.
50,This is a great place to stay. There are indoor walkways in between Luxor and Mandalay Bay and Excalibur. Lots of shops restaurants and things to do you don't even have to leave the hotel. Slots are ok didn't win anything big. On home game days there is a tent set up in front of the hotel for tailgating.
10,Not even going to waste my time on this again. Poor customer service dirty rooms. Ask questions and no answers. Always the run around thing. Long line to check in. The host gives you attitudes when you ask questions.
20,I stayed at the Luxor with my wife for our 7 year anniversary. We arrived at the hotel and checked in online. I had barely any interaction with the staff so I can’t speak to them. Someone had spilled a large drink in the elevator and based on how sticky/congealed it was it had been there for quite some time. Our room was nice and the bed was very comfortable. The issue came in the morning when my wife wanted some coffee. We didn’t have any in our room despite it being a suite. Then I was informed that the in-room dining service was no longer supported. When I asked for some coffee to be sent up so we could use our cheap little in room coffee pot. The front desk member stated they would send it up but after a 45 minute wait we just left. For such a large and successful hotel to fail to provide such a basic service is unacceptable.
50,Great hotel with a very reasonable price. Really enjoyed the Cabana and pool. Reasonable price and was able to give my family that experience. Easy to get through and casino was very clean. Would definitely book again
10,Hotel is run down loud awful noise from toilet in hotel room when flushed customer service sucks weed smoking at the pool personal bluetooth speakers at pool ruining relaxing experience half of pool and restaurants were closed but they expect you to pay full resort fees and no M Life rewards for table play.
10,Pool and hit tub cold internet poor and no help from any staff. Their excuse was that their understaffed. We tried numerous times to contact front desk and were ignored all times or excuses given. Stay elsewhere.
50,The Luxor is an easy to get in and out Casino. The rooms are a good size and clean. The Casino is and the staff is very helpful. The House keeping staff is very quick to respond. Every staff member I encountered made my stay very good.
40,The stay could have been better. The rooms are severely dated and in need of a remodel. The carpets were dingy and felt dirty. The air didn't work well. The shower and sink were clogged. On a positive note the room was quiet and the bed was more comfortable than I expected. Staff was friendly.
10,They don't have good rooms water was cold the whole stay had to pay twice for parking although I pre paid for parking. No Microwave mini fridge or coffee maker. Room smelled like wet dogs hotel it totally outdated and staff could care less.
50,Great place to stay just dont do the app for keyless entry. It didn't want to sign up my +1 for the secondary key and we had a lot of issues with my phone too. So we had to get the physical key to get into our rooms.
50,We had intended to visit in February but the COVID thing ruined that idea. Fast forward to late September hopefully to avoid the oppressive heat and the need to cower under the thumb of the Democrats...no such luck. The weather was actually enjoyable the only drawback to the trip was the omnipresence of useless facemasks for everyone except the showgirls (?) unbelievable at times.
10,One person working check in 45 minutes waiting in line. Rooms were flithy hair on the floor bath tub had no water line shower was gross. Beds were barely made carpet was gross. Highly recommend staying away from this hotel been to vegas 20+ times this took the cake for worst. Stay somewhere else and Luxor invest some money in renov or blow up the building and rebuild.
20,Until they get a softer bed I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. I'm not picky as far as soft or firm. The bed should not be feel as though there are no springs inside. After long days everyone wants to just sleep comfortably.
40,Our room was clean and the beds were comfortable. Check in on their app was easy and convenient. The Diablo Cantina has a nice atmosphere and the food and service were good. All the bars and restaurants are pretty pricey though!
30,A/C didn't cool the room very well. Asked for maintenence to fix our sink that drained very slow but never came. Shower leaks into the room so the floor was wet. Other than that the stay was good. Just needs a little updating.
40,Only reason I gave them 4 stars and not 5 is because the rooms have no refrigerators! And I’m pretty sure I paid both my room and room fees ahead of time and they still stiffed me with like $200 at check in! Also the pools are small they have no shade and you have to pay for seating! On top of that you can’t take outside beverages speakers food and all kinds of dumb rules.
30,Room not up to standards in regards to comfort. Especially the shower and tube drain very very slow. Room left cold after cleaning and heat did not come on. That side of the hotel was dingy and dirty compared to the other sides of the hotel that I have stayed on in previous trips to Las Vegas. Elevators didn’t work well
30,Nice room but the bathroom sucked.  Some Einstein designed the shower with only half the opening closed and the other half open. Result is the floor gets flooded every time it’s used. Maybe all that moisture is what make the door hinges squeak. Anybody that gets up during the night wakes everyone else when they close the door.
50,We traveled to Las Vegas for my husbands 60th birthday. Thanks for helping me make it a special week for him. We were able to get to all the activities that I had planned for this week. The Pyramid Cafe was a nice surprise for breakfast. Great service!
30,Hotel needs renovations. Escalators elevators and conveyer belts only work in certain locations. Do not travel if you have small children or disabled family the lack of elevators and escalators hinders travel from one side of hotel to next
20,So I would say that overall the experience was not as enjoyable as I would like. The room smelled like smoke so when we left the hotel all of our items smell like smoke as well. However the food was really good in the hotel. The staff was also friendly.
20,My room has to be switched 3x’s upon arrival. Each room was filthy. Luckily the court room we could deal with. If you don’t mind a little filth go for it. It’s affordable compared to other hotels....
50,The room was cleaned and fresh every time we came back. The staff were always there to help with any questions we had. We loved the pool and having food near by when we disnt feel like going out. Definitely recommend this place!
30,Nice room for the price. Beautiful  clean and roomy. However Luxor needs to streamline the digital key process to make the “skip the line check-in process” more seamless and intuitive for visitors.
30,If you want to sleep in a pyramid problem do it for one night. That’s it. The price seemed reasonable yet the resort fees will get you if your there for more then 3 days. Food court did have a good selection considering there isn’t a microwave or coffee pot in the room.
30,If you have low expectations of vegas luxor is perfect. Small drinks served once an hour in the casino. Long lines. Pool closed at 6. Eateries closed at odd hours. BRIGHT SPOT was el Diablo restaurant... It was delicious and wonderful.
10,Was just looking for a place to stay in Vegas. Rooms were decent but this place obviously is just trying to take money from you in every way possible. Advertised on google as $38 a night. Doesn’t include the hotel fee ($48) parking ($15 per night) and an additional $100 deposit when you check out. Casino is sad. They don’t give you any free vouchers to play or points to get at least a free meal like normal casino’s do. Don’t waste your money here. Better to stay at a Days Inn.
50,The price was awesome for the location. The room was so nice and spacious. Would definitely book here again. We had an amazing time and it was nice to come back to a comfortable room after a day on the strip or after a night of partying
30,My brother and I flew in to town to see the Dolphin/Raiders game. While the hotel was super convenient to the stadium there was one very disappointing thing. There was no refrigerator coffee maker or microwave in the room. I would've been ok without the microwave but I don't remember the last time I stayed in a hotel without a refrigerator. We had leftovers one night at dinner and no place to store them so we just had to throw them out.
20,This hotel has very rude staff. They argued with us in regards to our reservations and told us we shouldn't have done what we did. The rooms were blah. Somewhat clean but in need of many upgrades. The location was alright. Would not recommend to anyone.
20,We got this room as part of a package for the Nascar race weekend. I've paid less for rooms and received more amenities. No fridge microwave or coffee maker in the room and one of the dresser drawers was actually a safe so it couldn't be used for storing clothes. Hotel is dark outdated and needs sprucing up.
10,I don't recommend Luxor for staying overnight in their outdated rooms and shaky elevator rides. Stay somewhere and just go sightseeing to meet your curiosity of what's inside this pyramid building. Worst resort themed hotel we stayed.
40,Great value on LV Strip friendly and accommodating staff nice room for the $ nice pool…my only complaint would be the lack of food options after 10 pm it’s during a pandemic so it’s understandable but it would be nice to have more options or any option other than the 24 hr convenience store where you pay over $10 for a packaged pre-made sandwich though they were decent quality
40,My wife and I had great stay. Loved the hotel. Especially being able to jump over to Mandalay Bay and Excalibur. The room was small and had no coffee maker or refrigerator. But other than that loved everything about Luxor. We went to Blue Man Group and Carrot Top! Loved both shows! Will definitely stay at Luxor again.
20,not very impressive I booked for 9/26 due to my flight arriving after midnight. I first messaged the Luxor twitter account asking if an early check in would be an issue and was told it wouldn't be just to call the property and let them know. when I called they told me they were sold out until 3pm which is check in time but for an additional $600+ they could make the room I had booked available at midnight. so are you sold out or not??? I had no choice after traveling from the east coast. so my bill doubles from $700 to over $1400 after taxes and fees. when I check in it looks like the room was never touched by the cleaning staff. there was a clog in the we bar and it was full of mucky water. I went to take a shower and dirty water came up from the drain . the room smelled of smoke and still had paper towels over the smoke detectors. and to make it worse the bed was full of HAIR!! so for $600+ I didn't get to shower or sleep in the bed I sat on the couch until it was time to check into the new room. the staff acted clueless when I tried to complain. I don't think I will be staying here in the future.
20,I have been to many of MGM locations and this one in my opinion needs renovating. The rooms are just okay the shower leaks no matter what onto the bathroom floor maybe to either poor design or old seals. The bed was on the hard side my hips began to hurt.  The parking is only 2 levels so on a busy day good luck finding a parking.
10,Luxor has gone downhill! Room had no hot water. Constantly had to correct billing problems. Stay somewhere else! Front desk help was a long wait and rude. Room assigned was not the room package I booked. Avoid up charges for food credits. You will have to argue with billing to credit your account.
40,"Best location by far if you attend a Raiders' game. Short walk plus they have the pre-game Beer Garden experience in the parking lot. Really liked the Steakhouse (Tender). Rooms will need a remodel soon but OK. Long walk from the elevator if you are near one of the pyramid corners that don't have an ""inclinator"". :-)"
50,It was a fantastic stay. Everything is in the casino. Food games even arcades for the kids. Drinks are fantastic. The service is amazing. I would definitely stay again. The pool was great enough space for a group. Yes try it …. You will like it.
40,Great hotel at a competitive price. Feel the stress and heat of Las Vegas drop away the instant you enter Luxor’s cavernous lobby. Rest assured that the temperature will be very comfortable. Take selfies with the many Egyptian statues. Take the inclinator to your room. Look out of the angled window. Your kingdom stretches out over the horizon. Walk or take an Uber to see other parts of this great city. Rest assured that the guiding beam from the pyramid will guide you home after your successful conquest. Visit the Bodies or Titanic exhibit. Eat some world class food. You have arrived. Ra smiles upon you and good fortune will be yours.
30,Inside the room you can hear all the noises from outside the cars the people talking in the corridors and even the people in the other rooms were heard when they spoke. It is easier to win money at the casino than to sleep there for a night.
10,Still waiting on my deposit to be refunded had no water for hours and no room serivce. I expected the rooms to look better plus the inside of the casino was ugly and boring. They should of had better entertainment.
20,Room definitely needs to be updated the bathroom (shower) sucked hardly any water to get a good shower the room was spacious. We had issues with the hottub the 1st night only hot water was working it took until the next day that the cold water was working
30,With a little TLC this pace could be wonderful. Topoptional pool clean pyramid glass and update the rooms. Maybe lose the carpet and put in luxury vinyl. Bring back the King Tut tomb and all of the artifacts
10,"Unless you want to spend valuable vacation time on hold trying to reach the front desk or collecting all of your luggage to transfer rooms until you get tired and just SETTLE for the third one... Don't waste your time!  Each time we needed to call for assistance from the front desk there was a hold time of at least 10 minutes (no exaggeration- and the hold advertising was annoying asf). Once we finally get a live person the wait for the service (whether extra towels bellhop or engineer was 30 minutes or more). We actually walked the halls and found assistance faster.  The ""updated/remodeled"" Pyramid premium rooms were not bad but just ok... Until you enter the bathroom which turns into a pool once you shower. The shower heads are good and the water pressure is great but the shower door was not well thought-out. Since the shower ""door"" is a non sliding half wall the water bounces off of your body onto the floor. Nice try for an upgrade but an epic fail. The next room had AC issues and the same bathroom setup so off to the 3rd room which was supposed to be an upgrade for the inconvenience but was NOT! Although it had more room it was dark and gloomy. That lighting was horrible! The furniture fit the theme of ancient and it was just creepy. The soaking tub would have been nice with some jets but hey... The tub would have also been nice if it was clean and didn't have a green slimy trail from a water leak to the drain.  I usually travel to Vegas several times a year and choose this hotel because of a wedding I was attending. This overall stay was the worst! Oh and the cherry on the top after all I put up with I was denied a late check out... SMH"
10,Charged my account an extra $200 for no reason. My stay was almost $500 when it should have been only $300. Chargers were unauthorized and made at 4 am. The hotel front desk even said they weren't sure and the charges were automated. No fridges in the room and the tv has no channels. Still waiting on my refund.
10,The people on the floor above me left their water on and my ceiling was leaking and literally falling apart. The front desk gave me a new room and I couldn’t find it because the hotel is like a riddle you have to solve to navigate through. When I asked them for help they told me everyone else found their room. When I told them I should be refunded and their service was terrible the guy told me if I don’t shut up I’ll be kicked out of the hotel.
20,I have stayed at Luxor in the past and it was a very nice experience.  This trip undid all of that in one visit.  Found 2 roaches in bathroom 1 in bedroom on last day. This killed the experience and trust I had for Luxor. Won't be staying here again. Luxor is a nice hotel but cleanliness is definitely an issue.
30,Perfect location upgraded to a corner king suite dirty carpets uncomfortable pillows plenty of room kind of a long walk vs just staying in a normal pyramid room. Nice bartenders security needs to relax a bit.
40,Stay was nice definitely loved the Egyptian decor. Room was clean minus the fact that they had to emergency shut the water off during our stay. Other than that great hotel good location you can use tram to reach any other areas of strip.
10,AC does not work properly! Many guests complained! They know it too. Look at other reviews. Unacceptable when it's 100 degrees outside. Room was also dirty! Again Unacceptable!!!! I gave it a one star bc their one star Carrot Top is awesome or I'd give it zero stars if I could!
20,Room was dirty. Shower had hair in it tv didn’t work. Tables were dusty and room smelt like mildew. Location is right off the strip and also close to a gas station and highway. Food options were very basic bar was cool.
30,"This place is almost at the southern end of the Strip and it is showing its age. Corridors are dark and convoluted both on the main floors and on the room floors. Probably a ""take"" on the secret passages of the real Great Pyramid but it did not translate well. Rooms were dark and lacking in amenities (as are most in LV...they want you out and about at the casinos not in your room). Beds were awful and there were no hand towels in the rooms. But they were super clean. Staff was really friendly and helpful. The casino was nothing to write home about either."
40,We love staying here nice casino easy walk to the stadium and arena and other casinos on the strip. Parking is good and access right off the freeway. Just no mini fridge in our room extra $25 charge.
50,Was in town with my son to purchase a car from a local dealer. I chose the Luxor because of it's cost and proximity to the dealership and airport. We found it to be located amongst a great selection of casinos and restaurants. We had an overall excellent experience.
30,The rooms at Luxor are acceptable. The rest of the experience was meh. Given that rates are comparable to other hotels on the strip it’s not anything I would do again.    I’ve stayed at several hotels on the strip and this is pretty middle of the road. I’d not recommend it but if your company is paying for you to stay in Las Vegas then they could worse for you.
10,Considering there are many other options on the strip this place does nothing to stand out in a positive way. They bleed you for every dollar they can including charging you extra for a mini fridge. I'll never stay here again.
30,Overall The hotel room was good. The only complaint I have is that the sink water in our room smelled funky and the shower door was a little wear and tear. Also if you’re going to do parking make sure they know you have a car or else you’re gonna have to pay for it like I did. I was never told or even asked if we came with our own vehicle so we can get our parking comped. But next time I’ll be sure to let them know.
30,The room we stayed in wasn’t “clean” to our satisfaction. The condition of the room was more reflective of the overall condition of the available furniture and amenities rather than job performance of the cleaning staff.    The bathroom door had prior water damage which prevented it from fitting the frame. The shower tub was clogged and barely drained after use. The shower head felt like a high pressure washer nozzle. Toilet flush system also needs to be replaced.    The overall experience at Luxor was far from positive. My wife and I were grossed enough to never take our socks off throughout our stay. We rarely stay at 4-star hotels but our experiences have been far better in regular Hilton properties. We wish to come back to MGM properties but would probably avoid Luxor.
10,The room was very dirty although after going to the front desk to get the situation resolved it was such a nonchalant response. No reassurance at all. After being a Gold member and coming often I honestly would not recommend anyone coming to this casino to play or have a room after so many infractions I have had time and time again. To even be told my membership status essentially holds no value me even being there is as if it holds no value is just a slap in the face.
10,The hotel was okay room does not have fridge microwave or half a door for the shower. Main issue is that I was barely in the room which was $100 total (for 4 nights) and am still waiting for my $200 deposit from the room.
30,Most restaurants were closing by 7/8pm and upstairs Starbucks doesn't open until 10am. Buffet that was supposed to be open 7am-3pm was still closed at 10am. We requested extra pillows and were told that the max we could get was 2 extra even with 4 people in the room.
10,Originally booked the Feel Good Suite. At check-in they informed us that the rooms were full and put us in a standard king room. Instead of a room with aromatherapy we got one that reeked of marijuana all night. Large unsightly water stain on the ceiling above the bed. Improper shower door on shower that soaked the entire bathroom with water after every shower. Will be returning to Las Vegas but never the Luxor. There are other Hotels in Vegas that exceed your expectations this one won’t even meet you expectations.
30,Hotel value overall is good however the rooms at the Pyramid need a little remodeling they look outdated compare to other newer hotels in Vegas. The staff is friendly and willing to help. If you like to walk this place is excellent for you. But it is a little far from the center of the strip.
50,Staff was friendly and the check in process through the app so you can skip the line and have your key on your phone was really nice. Casino bars and eateries in the hotel were great. The pool was really nice as well. Room was actually very nice and the bed was so comfy for how little the room cost.
20,Unable to address issues that were easy to fix. Staff never answered the phone. Water overflowed from restroom sink no fridge and medication went bad. Called front desk and no one answered. They were probably busy but not fair for people who pay a lot to  Stay there
10,I was charged for 2 nights instead of 1.  There was trash in my rooms trash cans. There was also a dirty Q-tip on the floor. The carpet in the hallway to my room was soaking wet. The room I booked over a month in advance wasn't available for me even though I put a deposit down.
30,"Age is catching up to the Luxor. Chips in walls stains on carpets wallpaper peeling air conditioner leaking water some alarm went off coming thru a speaker in the ceiling saying ""alert system"" never did find out what it was. Towels were clean at least. Staff was very friendly as well. Casino was dank and musty but they all are now I believe. For the money we paid I just expected more. Shame on them? Me? Oh well over and done."
20,Check in was smooth and easy with my phone. Also liked that I could use my phone as a digital key. Plenty of shops/dining/gambling inside the hotel itself. My negative stems from a few things: There were bugs (not sure what kind) on the bedding. We found roaches in the bathroom and even one crawling on the head of one of our toothbrushes. We were woken up by a blaring alarm in the middle of the night and when we called to ask about it the front desk said they didn't know. We swam at the pool one day and there was general nastiness floating along the sides and even found a used mask in the water.
50,Luxor room was very nice and great view. Had a great stay while visiting Vegas and going to Raiders game. Made it really easy just to walk to game. Casino and sports book were a lot of fun. Easy access to a lot of food options too.
30,No hand towels flooded bathroom after shower can’t see tv from chairs undisclosed property fee surprise at check in. Non caroeted floors would make luggage transport so much easier especially up the ramp to the parking garage.
50,A week stay at Luxor. Took in Brad Garret comedy show. To funny. Went to really nice dinners with friends at lago Beliego. Also ate at wolf gangs. Went on high roller great breath taking view.Every staff members were super nice and helpful.!!
10,.    ................. um no will not be back room way over priced not the room I booked tv didn't work no ammidies.....................................................I would have rather stayed at motel 6 and saved money
50,Great stay overall. The luxior is a great place to stay. Look no farther. Everything you need in one place. The restaurant were amazing. The view was excellent. The pool and the spa were great. I will give the Luxor 100 stars
10,No privacy in room maids come in and bother anytime  I was staying extra day and a guy was knocking on my door like the police asking me when I’m going to leave I took care of it the night before called downstairs to let them know and my room wasn’t that nice to be called a suite and also elevators were to far
40,Busy weekend in Las Vegas. This weekend had a Raiders game UFC fight and who knows what else was happening. The hotel was prepared for for the surge over the weekend. I cannot complain the overall quality was good compared to other locations in Las Vegas that can be less than good. Luckily I am not a nervous when it comes to Las Vegas or large groups gathering for a specific event. So I knew when did time my trips appropriately and when to enjoy the Luxor Hotel where I was staying.
10,Items stolen from locked room staff was no help at all. Filed police report hotel refused to do anything. Just kept getting the run around. Crappy hotel and staff! Toilet was filthy and the floors were disgusting.
10,"Get what you pay for I guess. Lessons learned. Rooms are dated even though we had a ""premium suite""  Furniture was broken and foot stools had cigarette burn holes in them.  It's hard to feel romantic when the shower drain is clogged and your standing in water!! Called the desk but was never addressed and they called me a midnight to see if it was still a problem and if we wanted it addresses. 7 hours after I informed them. Oi!! But like I said get what you pay for! Might be all you need for a cheap girls/boys weekend but anything more is a bust."
10,I’ve been staying at the Luxor for years now but this visit will be my last. Even though old pyramids rooms are remodeled as a whole the hotel really has gone down hill. The morning of my departure there was no water couldn’t take a shower because I had to catch my morning flight. No hot water on my second day. Sewer smell from drains. Front desk took at least 10 mins to answer and I was told the water has been restored and all she could do is remove the $35 resort fee for 1 day. Wow thanks! Even the water restored I had a flight to catch! Will not be staying here again and do not recommend it.
20,The room was horrible. The shower design resulted in copious amounts of water on the bathroom floor. Hence the two bath mats. The drain in the shower was slow to drain that meant you were standing in near ankle high water. AC issues that left the carpet wet and a musty smell in the room. Maintenance knocked on our door late into the evening to fix the clogged AC line. Not worth the $400 per night.
10,"if i could give the luxor ""0"" stars i would. this trip was extremely unpleasant from the time we arrived until our departure. i am gold status and i was not offered an upgrade at check in and the room i was given was over a mile from the elevator. additionally the lighting was out in a long stretch of the hallway and the hallway reeked of marijuana. our room smelled of mildew and a pile of dirty clothes was left in the corner from the previous guest. no one at the front desk or security was accomodating in any way from checking in to inquring about my louis vuitton watch that was left in the room after we checked out to using the resort credit that i was supposed to be given during the stay. i had an overall horrible experience here and i will not patronize this establishment on any future trip."
10,I do not normally write a bad review I just stay quiet and know they lost my future business…. But in this case…. Hotel has not been kept up…. Not clean.. only 1 decent restaurant…there are plenty of M-Life hotels to choose from. Pick one….
20,Hotel didn't honor $50 resort credit as part of MGM advertisement. No refrigerator in room for diabetic meds which was a huge inconvenience. Very far walk from self parking to hotel room. Did not feel valued as a guest.
40,The room was great. I loved the showers. The front staff was very helpful with changing my room from the sixth floor to the first floor without inconveniencing my vacation. I wish Luxor had hotel transportation from the hotel to the airport.
20,Not as great as my first time I stayed. I enjoyed my first time in vegas and stayed at the luxor so of course on my second visit I was thrilled to stay here again. Unfortunately the food was over priced buffet was closed for the days I stayed except the last. The food got me sick when I got a chance to go and it was pretty bad food for the most part. CHeckin took about 75 minutes waiting on line and could not digitally checkin at a kiosk for some reason even though I had purchased our rooms online. Most of the shows that were being advertised that I wanted to see werent available. Staff was cool and maids were friendly.
50,Everything about the hotel was great. The only minor issue is location. It sets at one end of the strip so it can be a bit much to get anywhere specific. If you stay here plan your events near the hotel or bring some walking shoes/plenty of ride fair.    There is plenty to do around the hotel and the surrounding hotels to keep you busy. My tip would be to get as much free play as possible if you want to gamble.    It was a great first place to stay at but it's more of a one time place or somewhere you go if you want to be in that specific area. We did walk to the T-Mobile center for some UFC fights while we was there so that was convenient!
50,I traveled with my son and my husband to vegas for a family trip/birthday party. We stayed in the Luxor Tower rooms and we loved it. Even from the second floor our view of the strip is really awesome. I had an accessible room which means we had a roll in shower instead of a bathtub but the room still had plenty of room. I love that we had close access to the elevators but fair warning the walk to the tower room from the front desk is a bit of a way down a few hallways and may be difficult for some with walking disabilities so make sure to try and get a scooter right away from the bell desk right next to check in. Our stay was 4 days and 3 nights and the scooter rental was for four days and came out to $100. About $25 a day. Also good to know is if you need to leave the hotel for a car ride the bell desk will store the scooter for you until you return. Over all the room was clean theres daily service again for the rooms and its really quiet. Mind you it was a busy weekend with UFC and a Raider game. We loved it and will be back.
10,Room was not cleaned. Sheets smelled. loud & disruptive guests. Lack of security. No urgency from staff. Parking is so far from the hotel rooms and not enough accessibility for handicap guests. Took to long to resolve the issues. Waste of my money...
50,This is the best hotel in Vegas it’s right in the middle of the life.. it’s not too far from anything and not right in the middle of the chaos. Don’t think twice just do it! Views out of the room pool is amazing! Staff is friendly ! See you there
20,Need to remodel the shower rooms are dated and there was no mini fridge . The food options were limited with the exception of the Mandalay Shoppes area which is shared between the properties. Bud light deck was decent.
40,The casino is great check in was really easy shops and food are good. Got a Deluxe room with the description saying renovated bathroom you don't want to leave but the tub looked retrofitted 15 years ago with a shower head thats probably the worst ive ever used. Only other complaint was they didn't have all the pools open so everyone is crammed in the 2 and you obviously have to wear a mask everywhere else so you think socal distancing would be something with masks.
10,This resort was filthy walking in the lobby. Check in was super easy using the mobile check in however once I made it to the room I was super disappointed. It was a corner king suite that was 800+ sq ft so I was thinking it was going to be great!!! Not at all. This room was a flash back to 1982 and hasn’t been updated since. You can’t even sit on the toilet and reach the toilet paper. I would never go back.
50,The luxor was a Wonderful experience. Our first time staying here. Will definitely stay again. Rooms were super clean bathroom clean just needs a shower door. Hard to warm up when half the door is gone and air gets in. But other than that beautiful. Casino was clean and fun.
40,Front desk lead me to believe that paying extra would be better views. No views whatsoever. Thank god for the black out curtains. Without them we would not be able to have kept the player from the luxe or pyramid out of our room
40,We loved staying at the Luxor. It was a nice hotel and close from everything. Great deals and prices for the night. The only think I have to say we didn’t like it was the parking. We drove from another state and every time we wanted to go out in the car we had to pay $15 some days we paid $30 because we couldn’t get the price for 24 hours. It’ll be nicer if the guests wouldn’t have to pay for parking since the rooms and resort fees are not cheap.
50,I had an amazing time at this property will be comings back again and again great casino great food won lots of money I will sure remind this property to any one that want to experience Vegas so with that being said see you next time Luxor !!
20,Less than 24 hours into our stay my car was broken into while parked in their “secure” parking garage and security seemed so bothered that I wanted to fill out any reports I could to have this handled. I received no compensation not even a voucher or a discount on my room and I wasn’t trying to be a B about it but I could’ve at least gotten a meal voucher. Then our neighbors to our room were blasting music every night and partying so loud we could hear their conversations and the music crystal clear and despite calling and complaining nothing ever happened even when the desk said they would send security to handle it.
10,No longer will stay this hotel in future😶  They lost soul of hospitality😢  Out dated furnitures dirty carpet and not welcoming stuff. Also parking fees not included in resort fees. Our room TV didn’t work. What is the point of paying the resort fees???
10,Currently stuck staying here after booking for three nights. Booked a tower king room and was “upgraded to a pyramid suite.” The suite was dirty dated broken furniture stained carpets and the tub was disgusting. Called to get another room took 30 minutes to get ahold of someone who told me to come downstairs to guest services where we waited another 40 minutes. Had little time to get ready for our 20th wedding anniversary. They offered us another pyramid king suite we declined and went with our original choice of rooms the king tower room. Less dated but none of the TV Chanel’s worked another 30 minute call. Pool shuts down at 6 they charge 15 per day for parking. One small bottle of shampoo for three days. No coffee for the coffee maker. This place has gone downhill fast I won’t play here till things are fixed and I won’t come back to stay and neither should you.
40,The 39 degree elevator was interesting but always felt like there was a chance the thing was on its last leg. Another guest described being stuck the previous day and that elevator was out of service for the 4 days and still when we left.  I would advise to stay in the tower.  The gambling floor was really nice and clean. Staff was nice. Food was great. 24/7 store was a real help.
10,The rooms were nice bathroom boring and shower got water EVERYWHERE without a way to prevent it. I alerted housekeeping that my room smelled of smoke at check in they assured me they would do something but instead I was charged for smoking! Needless to say I was VERY upset. The rep I spoke with didn't make it better she didn't seem to care and was more dismissive than concerned. The pool was fun because of this I may be back and hopefully I'll be able to give a better review.
40,We were there for a business seminar. We stayed in the pyramid so I can only speak the to rooms in the pyramid. The rooms are clean and the beds are very comfortable. I usually don't sleep well in hotel rooms this was not the case at the Luxor. You can tell the hotel is from the 80's but they have done a great job at updating the rooms. The only negative really were the towels seemed cheap and the lack of plug ins for USB charging. The TV signal is low quality too. There are plenty of normal electrical sockets though.
20,Kinda dirty and no amenities in rooms. We will try somewhere else next time. I thought the TROPICANA seemed more my speed. The Tropicana lobby/Casino had a lot older crowd and a better environment in my opinion.
20,Initially the check-in was horrible we had to put $150 deposit plus the resort fee of $120 for the days that we stayed the staff was not helpful most of them told me that they were new and I have to carry a 50 lb box of liquor from The Luxor to the Mandalay because the staff was so unhelpful that they did not tell me that there was a Trailway or a train that went in between the Mandalay Bay Luxor to the Excalibur etc so I actually could have rode to the Mandalay Bay instead of walking
50,If you want all the fun of Vegas without the masses of drunk crazies hanging all around you the Luxor is the perfect place. Connected internally to Mandalay Bay and Excalibur you have access to three casinos and tons of shops and restaurants without ever going outside. The suite was great the staff was very nice and overall it was a great get a way!
30,"Staff was neutral. They were not welcoming. ""Hotels should welcome guests in their own hospitable language"" and there was only silence. The rooms were clean but dated. The hotel was clean but dated. The pool staff was unbalanced many life guards only one pool open at first then on busy days only one host for paying guest of the umbrellas and cabanas while other pool staff just stood around. Cross training is probably would be ideal."
40,We stayed on a football weekend and it was very exciting. The staff were friendly and our room was great. We ate at he sports bar cafe and tender's steak house. We had great meals at all three. Our casino host was great and we got exceptional value from being an Mlife member. If you stay here you must get the mlife card.
50,The rooms are very nice and clean the easy check in and out excellent front desk service the casino its always a place to play and have fun me gusto que hay mucha gente que trabaja en Luxor que habla eapañol
10,My very first time ever visiting Las Vegas I booked a third party stay at the Luxor with southwest airlines the plane ride was great the hotel first night I went there to stay thinking Id have a great time I checked in went and go food and drinks and came back to my first room I noticed as I started to eat that there was dried food thumb print and stains on the nightstand I contacted the hotel after a very long hold time finally they came up got me a second room to a suite I went to get my stuff in that room and went to the bathroom as I flushed the toilet the toilet started spraying toilet piss water on my leg Disgusting and during Covid-19 this hotel was trying to make me sick and die HORRIBLE (I have a video of all this NASTINESS). I tried to reach them on the phone but no answer longest wait time Finally I went down to the front desk talked to a manger the manager said to me he was going to comp me for the 2 night that's what I heard him say and he give me a $100 beverage credit (which I didn't get to use the whole amount) by then Id drank so much which I paid before the beverage credit was applied and it was so late moving from 3 different rooms to actually start my Las Vegas Vacation I was only there for 2 days so it made it WORSE to enjoy myself after this!!!! I asked for a refund from the Hotel they told me to contact the third party then they'd get me my credit then the hotel tells the third party they wont refund anything to me WTF your on BS playing games HORRIBLE HORRIBLE BEWARE THEYLL give you COVID_19 be careful!!!!!
30,If there’s a raider game expect it to be very difficult to park whether it be valet or pre-paid self park. It took us +45 min just to park since the local game had plenty of pedestrians not allow anyone to drive between luxor and Excalibur. This includes if you want a taxi out of luxor. The taxi wait line was +100. Concierge service was closed / unavailable. Fridge in room was broken and furniture in room was severely scuffed and marked with slashes.    The view and hot tub in the room were exceptional though.    Also using the app as a digital key for both the room door and elevator was unreliable as the app kept running into errors. And it wasn’t in our interest to wait in the lobby line with +100 raider fans trying to book a last minute room. So getting a physical key would be time consuming if you booked your trip weeks/months ahead of time.
20,Dissatisfaction described in previous section. Our air conditioning barely worked. We were miserable on our wedding night. Got a fan the first night they changed our air filter the second night nothing done the third night and we had given up by the fourth night. Paid too much money between the room and the restaurants/casino for such a thing to happen. I’ve had more comfortable stays with better service and hotels that were much cheaper.
20,No sufficient details provided for mobile digital checkin. Did not state which tower the room is located on the app. Hard to find tower room that was assigned to us. Had to ask multiple staff for help. And upon arrival to room it was not thoroughly cleaned and found with old wash towels in bathroom. Throughout the night there were a lot of noises from people because we were assigned a room on the first floor of the casino so we didn’t get much sleep.
10,Parking lot is too far.  Rooms are far from elevators ( like too far ) in Vegas every minute counts and it takes you like 20 to 35 minutes to get from the parking lot to elevators to your room.  They don’t have a bell men 24/7  Even though people check in and check out 24/7 . It’s really inconvenient not to have a bell men  we had to carry all 12 bags out ourselves so we had to do like 3 trips all the way to the parking lot. We would not be coming back to Luxor ( not even for $ 0.00 dollars )
40,I thought the hotel seemed very crowded. I stayed in one of the towers and just getting out was an ordeal with all the halls you have to walk. I also thought with COVID they would do a better job of ventilating the space. It felt smoky.
10,This hotel will never get my money again. The a/c in our room barely worked the t.v. looked TERRIBLE like it was 10 years old and 720p grainy. No fridge or microwave in the room. Only one elevator would take us up to the room because each corners elevators only go to certain floors for some reason. There is half a shower door so water goes everywhere and had to be cleaned after every use. There are no signs directing you to the pool at all and staff didn't want to help us find it. No dead bolt on the door. They let people bring dogs through the casino and some of the blackjack dealers were the slowest I've ever seen. As i walked down the strip and looked at other casinos with envy for their class and WOW factor i thought Never again will i stay at the luxor.
10,Nice building dirty rooms There was no fridge to keep food cold no microwave in the rooms the rooms were slightly dirty my bathtub was dirty throughout the whole stay and the floors were not clean carpet very muddy and dirty
30,No help getting a cab from Luxor for an early am flight out. Almost missed flight. There was no staff around so front desk staff said google cabs in Vegas. Really??? So much not providing a service which is needed
20,Stayed at Luxor for Raider home game. The pre party beer garden was nice and staff was friendly at hotel. The hotel is dated and needs a refresher for rooms food options and entertainment. Will be tough to compete with newer nicer options on the strip if they don’t reinvest in property.
10,Unclean room ordinary amenities now charge you and arm and a leg for fridge and microwave. We notified the front desk of illicit materials on the desk when we arrived in our room they simply said whoops we will notify house keeping. No one came we had to clean it up ourselves.
50,This stay was awesome I like the luxor and its location walk to the raiders stadium cross over to the excalibur and go shopping or stay and dine at the diablos cantina either way you take it the luxor is a cool spot for the price I never mind mu stay at the luxor.
50,I stayed at Luxor for one night this trip! It was fantastic! The service was great . The room was clean and the pyramid cafe served an excellent breakfast!! Check out was quick and easy as well as the check in process
50,Very close to stadium if going to the game. A little far from center of strip of if walking. But nothing bad. Hotel is very clean and so are rooms. Wish I could’ve stayed longer than just a quick weekend trip.
50,The Luxor are a so convenient and luxurious. All you need is under one roof. If your going to the Allegiant stadium for any of the events especially the Raiders games this is the place to stay you are just a hop skip and a jump away.
30,Most people use their rooms to sleep and get cleaned up....about 6 or 7 hours a day. Its a hot shower and a bed...the rest of their time they are gone.....you want luxury spend the money...you want a clean room this is a convenient place to spend your trip
50,Luxor may be close to the end of the strip but makes up for it with its unique characteristics. The casino was exactly what i like bar and waiting staff were very friendly and quick. The pool was a great atmosphere
20,The hotel is a motel 6 in the shape of a pyramid. Elevators 5 minutes away from your room peeling wallpaper and carpet stains broken outlets and amenities the things that work are from 2 decades ago and all this for $1000? Unless you really can’t bare the drive from a cheaper hotel I would avoid this hotel.
40,This was an anniversary / birthday trip. Had a wonderful time a few hiccups (wouldn't be a fun trip if you didn't have those) but overall an amazing trip with the hubby for our 26th anniversary and my birthday.
40,"I have not been to Vegas in over 8 years but do play ""My Vegas"" on the computer without using any real cash. My ""M Life"" card comp'd my four nights. I was in a King room in the East tower. A beautiful clean room with an actual refrigerator sitting area great views huge bathroom. Clean and spotless. Great security use of key card to go on the elevator to your floor. A sanitizer pack of hand sanitizer and masks. They didn't seem to police the the casino floor though most guests wore them. The slots were terrible not paying hardly at all. The resort fees are RIDICULOUS  I drove from Tucson and had to pay additional $15 a night for parking. It was covered but should have been included in resort fee. Probably will not stay there again. Restaurants were hard to figure out when they were available and prices were extremly high also. Vegas is pretty much a tourist trap anymore!"
50,The room was large and clean. Large shower with great water pressure. Wish there had been a fridge but not a dealbreaker. Price was great compared to other hotels on a very busy weekend. Would stay again
30,We had a great time here. The staff was friendly and the rooms were clean. If you are coming to this hotel just understand that early check-in comes at a hefty price tag that the staff may or may not tell you about upfront. The rooms were clean but they were showing there age as well. The only two complaints I have were that there was no refrigerator in the room (so keep that ion mind) and the elevators just seem to take so long. Other than those items it was a great time had by all.
50,This place was great and the pool was amazing can’t wait to go back and stay again most amazing part as well was the bed was so comfortable. I also recommend seeing a show because the have some great ones as well.
50,The Luxor has experienced a change. The staff now have an unbelievably positive attitude and go out of their way to help you. I encountered a large check in line that went really fast. I expected an hour wait and was in and out in 10 minutes. The room granted a suite was over the top with comforts. While crowded due to a Las Vegas Raiders game cross the street they compensated for the surge flawlessly.
40,We were driving to Disneyland and had a stayover in Vegas for the night. Got a good deal on a room at the Luxor and always wanted to show off one of the pyramid rooms to my wife (who's never been). We had some difficulty with getting our room set up as planned so she didn't get to ride the elevators or stay in the room that I had reserved for us but overall the stay was pleasant.
30,Last minute trip to celebrate wife's birthday but we're disappointed in the overall cleanliness of the Luxor and the smell of smoke everywhere. This place needs to remove or reduce smoking. Also establish a reasonable dress code.
50,My family and I had a wonderful stay at the Luxor! We can’t wait to go back!!We got to see many things and go to many new places we haven’t ever been before and it was so amazing!!! The Luxor staff was very nice and the hotel was very clean. Ty
20,The 2queen bedrooms is dated . The whole East tower needs renovations . The bathroom @#16342 needs new fixtures and furnishings. The beds are sagging. The carpet and curtains needs new ones. There are no refrigerator coffee maker and microwave which is very essential for travelers with young family.
30,Room was left unclean in many areas. Hallways need attention as well as elevators. Bed mattress sunken in. Room not cool enough. Must be regulated to only get so cool as we set at 74 and it was much warmer.
40,If you aren’t considering being in your room for long periods of time & looking for a good deal you found your spot! Otherwise keep looking. The rooms were not cleaned well & they upgraded the room but the bathrooms are still older
30,When we checked in on our mobile phone we had to hold our key pass from the app over a reader in the elevator which didn’t work. Staff assisted us in the elevator to make it to our floor. Once we got to the room it smelled really bad. Went in the bathroom and there were housekeeping rags in the sink. The shower floor was covered in globs of hair and what looked like coffee grounds or I don’t know what kind of dirt that was. Maybe the drain had backed up anyways the whole bathroom was still wet. The air was on 65 but the room temperature was 81° So that wasn’t working either. We called the desk we were told to come downstairs we went to the service desk who told us to get in line and we stood in line for 45 minutes before getting someone to help us. They did place us in another room which smelled like women’s perfume from whoever was there before but the condition of the room was OK. And there was no other compensation. The rest of the trip went OK.
10,The hallway ceilings are caving in. The elevators barely work. This should be a 2 star motel. If you have a problem management staff refuses to call you back and the staff is rude. The shower only has a half a door which makes the floor flood. HORRIBLE HORRIBLE
10,Terrible customer service roomed smelled horrible got charged for movies that didn’t tittle PPV. My door was opened by staff while my wife was in the shower with out us requesting staff help when I called front desk the staff stated I requested room service LIES
10,This was a horrible experience. The room was not clean. The service was very poor. We heard nothing but noise when we tried to sleep. This was just the worst hotel we ever stayed in. I wouldn’t recommend this hotel to anyone to stay in.
50,I had read some reviews both good and bad but I will stayed there and glad I did amazing hotel beds were really comfortable amenities we awesome staff awesome good great blue man group was the best show ever would definitely stay there again on our next trip
10,Absolutely horrible. My first room in the West Tower had cockroaches. Was awakened on my second night by one crawling on my face. Caught two more and carried them down to the front desk. Was given a new room directly across the hall as if the roaches didn’t have legs. Second room had not been vacuumed in years the toilet dripped constantly the caulking was falling out of the walls multiple wall outlets did not work and there was a lot of possible black mold. The TV would not stay connected for more than 15 minutes. Guests are loud in the hallways at all hours Thur-Sun.    At least it’s on brand with the pyramid theme as the ancient Egyptians had bugs crawling everywhere and didn’t have vacuums either. 0/10. Would not recommend.
10,Me and my 2 year old son got stuck in an elevator on the 20th floor and when i pushed the call button the lady said she’s handling it and hung up I called back and she said stop calling. They comped a room and said don’t ask for anything else.
30,Beautiful hotel love the location of it but the rooms to be upgraded didn't have no refrigerator or microwave . Everything has to some outside because of no items provided for use in your rooms. The shower with the one sided glass pane didn't care for.
20,I have stayed here 4/5 times before this. I always enjoyed my stays. I have always been on the better end of the stick when it comes to the Luxor. This time I didn’t get the room I booked and when I tried to change to my correct room I was told I couldn’t. I asked again later on in the day and they finally put me in a better room. Not the room I paid for but a better one. But I will not be returning.
10,Dirty filthy room staff refused to get manager ended up checking out a day early this place is an embarrassment  I expected so much more it was my first time staying at the luxor my first time in King suit it was the worst experience I could imagine
30,Was disappointed Steak house wasn’t open. Love the restaurant “Public House” but I missed some of the items that used to be on it. Missed their great onion soup. Portions were always nice sized and well presented.
50,Having the app helps a lot with check in and out also shows entertainment and dinning info! Staff was helpful and friendly and I didn’t have any issues! I have been to Vegas many times but first time staying at Luxor if they had more Egyptian items in the rooms it would be 😍!!!
50,"Pretty good value for what you get i have stayed in multiple rooms and cleanliness is felt in the highest of eooms ans the lowest rooms. The walk from the resort to the strip is not easy and convenient but doable (about a 20minute straight shot).    Would recommend their is not many ""hidden fees"" that you will experience"
50,I really enjoyed my stay in the Luxor Towers for one night to celebrate the 60th birthday of my ex-wife with two of my adult sons. The hotel was well maintained and the casino had a variety of games to play.
30,First time visit in Vegas…Overall for price it was ok but less than expected…rooms are showing their age (mattresses needed shower head put on which was fixed right away light switches were tricky) many restaurants/stores not open only 1 pool open during stay…more options offered at Excalibur and Mandalay Bay.
10,Dirty vent hair on the toilet and there were “stuff” spattered in the underside of the toilet seat. Had to call housekeeping twice before it was cleaned. On the second call I had to get grossly descriptive about what’s on the underside of the seat and demanded that it be clean before I go in there. Should have stayed at the Mandela Bay. Only the valets were prompt and polite. The remaining staff were mediocre.
40,The Luxor is what a person should expect for the price but it is just a little bit more. Most of the staff is so committed to making sure that the time spent there is memorable. Tender is great! The Pyramid Cafe staff is great! The bartenders and drink servers on the casino floor were all really good. The weed smell was almost non-existent Monday Tuesday and Wednesday but by the weekend it was really skunky. Having stayed at the Palazzo in June without a mask mandate made me see that the mask mandate is a real buzz kill. I won't come back until it is lifted for sure. The staff was really good about it but it's just too much to deal with when a person is trying to drink and have a good time. As I am writing this hours after leaving I can still feel a string behind my ears... enough!!  I recommend the Luxor to anyone who wants to not be surrounded by the homeless that are begging all over the center strip. Mandalay Bay and Excalibur are on either side and between these three properties there is plenty of variety.  And Carrot Top was really good too!!
30,If you’re insisting on Vegas and staying on the strip but don’t mind dark dated and impersonal the Luxor is great. It’s at the end of the strip so a buy out of the hustle but also means you’re going to spend time and/or money getting anywhere. The food is sub par and crazy expensive. Def do NOT recommend eating at any of the hotel restaurants or buffet. It’s cool that the hotels are linked via a mall vibe it’s a shame that so many stores are closed and moving walkways aren’t operating. It adds to the vibe that the hotel is dilapidated. The tub had a great view but crazy awkward to get in/out of. (Should be noted it was also slimy inside after filled with water) And the view is fabulous but the windows are filthy and the heat from them can’t be counteracted with what the AC could put out. I was expecting such a different experience this trip.
40,"Location was great. It is still a lot of walking but not bad for location. No microwave is really inconvenient. The bath tub did not look cleaned well and did not drain very well either. Only one small pool was open so made it impossible to relax with so many people in one small pool. Also being hounded every which way by staff for these ""deals"" that require you to spend 2+ hours at a completely different hotel to be hounded by people there to buy a timeshare. So many new people fell into that trap. It was sad and really annoying be asked every which way you turn. We simply were asking for directions and instead of helping us we were taken to the sales desk for ""deals"". They don't provide any maps or additional assistance on how to get around the hotel or surrounding areas."
30,Fun vacation. Casino smelled strongly of cigarette smoke and was not well ventilated. Pool not open in the evenings at all. Room was clean and comfortable with a room safe to use for free. Ice machine was available. Lots of shops and restaurants close by. Tram available to use.
10,Here are few issues with this hotel and it is management:  1-Elevators are loud and constantly shaken  2- Rooms quality are not worth the money  3- Room service and or front desk impossible to reach  too busy to answer your calls  4- Rooms are loud  5- Service is poor
30,Housekeeping could use more training and be more courteous. My room wasn't cleaned one day and when I got back to the room and called housekeeping I was told it couldn't be cleaned til next morning so I had to sleep on dirty sweaty sheets
10,Cigarette smoke filled it was dirty long as f line to get checked in which they easily could fix. Especially if they updated their website and technology. Completely antiquated rooms that need a lot of work done.
20,I reserved 2 rooms and wasn’t told I had to pay for parking so I was charged for 2 vehicles 1 per room 15 per day that was ridiculous. Not too mention my room bathroom door knob was broken and sink clogged. Very disappointed ☹️
30,Value was great. location ok. room was hot. A/ c not the best in room . Public’s did not open until late in the date and staff was kind of rude!! Piano bar was exceptional! Location wa as great and slots were tight!! :(
30,The water at the pool was dirty the first day of our stay the room didn’t get cleaned so I had to ask to get clean towels to shower. Also the hotel didn’t provide body shower so I had to go to store and buy some. It was not the best experience.
40,Originally booked a king pyramid with a view and was bumped to the west tower was given no explanation on why or compensation. We had delays after delays from our flight which goddess in at 1 AM tried to do the virtual key but wouldn’t let us up had to wait in the check in line that took Us 45 minutes to get checked in. We were so tired we didn’t even argue the fact that we were bumped from the pyramid to the tower was very disappointed. Wanted to stay in the pyramid it was my 40th birthday party.
10,I stayed here because the rooms were described as newly renovated on the website. My room was very dark the furniture was damaged and the fixtures were very old. Coffee pot had no top no cups no coffee
30,1st trip was awesome. So good we planned the second trip here. The 1st one was in a pyramid room 2nd in the towers. Supposedly the towers are better but not for us. We got a view of the pyramid no strip no mountains no buildings. The AC was HOT. We actually opted to check out early and stay at another property cause we kept waking up sweating. Maybe it was just a fluke but we would try another property next time just in case.
50,I love everything about this place period there is nothing to complain about here. life feels great at the Luxor they made me feel like royalty. I will be staying here again. Y’all better book now if you know what’s good❤️❤️❤️❤️
50,Nice hotel very clean good staff. Everything worked as it should. No problems and great first experience. I wish I would of won some money but I will be back to Vegas sometime. Uber makes your travel easy and fast. A lot to see and do but everything cost. Vegas likes their money.
50,Clean facility friendly staff comfortable bed and pillows. Surprisingly quiet in the room at night compared to the other hotel we stayed at this trip which was on the strip. Luxor was the highlight!
40,Our stay was perfect with the exception of the elevators. Elevator wouldn’t read our key card sometimes and it would take us a couple trips to get to our actual floor. Our room was perfect the bed was super cozy. Definitely would return for future stays.
10,I reserved the premiere suite the room I received was big but dirty carpet doors scratched furniture old and worn looked disgusting never will visit again. After hours of arguing finally got the room in the pictures but meant someone else received that disgusting room.
10,Check-in said I was getting upgraded (showed picture of room) was supposed to be nicer and easier to access due to my knee injury. I was charged extra (resort fees) thought that was included in package but was not. There are taxes on resort fees as well (FYI). Room was not easily accessible farthest end from elevator. It was not an upgraded room that she showed a picture of ( it was my original room) room was filthy finger prints and smudges of make-up and god knows what else all over doors and walls and loose coins and crumbs on floor. Tried to call front desk several times over 3 days and never was able to get through to talk to someone. T.V. didn’t work and other amenities not available.
20,Needs to be cleaned up and serviced around rooms elevators and hallways. Dirty hallways and poorly draining sink curtains broken room door wouldn't seal correctly but would lock. Broken lamp bulbs and no extra pillows. Didn't want to deal with waiting on someone to fix stuff so just won't stay there again.
50,Excellent hotel with an excellent staff!! The spa was amazing and I loved the food court! My massage was unbelievably great and I thoroughly enjoyed the spa!! It was perfectly located and I can’t wait to come back and stay there!!
30,I was not aware of the resort fee when I checked in. When I arrived at my room I found left behind garbage that housekeeping forgot to clean out. Also the sink faucet looked poorly cleaned and there were a couple of stains on the bed sheets. Other than that no serious problems.
10,Contact less check in wasn't working which had us waste a good portion of our vacation running around casino trying to get 2 door keys that took less than 1 minute to make in the first place. Elevator system with keys is a joke.. Ordered a drink through app at poolside. It took more than 40 mins to get drink after asking a server what happened. Then got interegated from server to see the app to make sure I wasn't lying. Of course the app doesn't show prior purchases. I told her if her manager has an issue ill show them the 45 dollars that processed through my bank account. Was done and ready to leave pool area by the time they showed up.. Wrong drinks were brought over anyway. The maids going into rooms were not wearing masks...Will not recommend luxor hotel or pool to anyone.
30,There are much nicer properties in LV but it seems as if the towers are better than the main hotel so I would stay there over the main hotel. Bad sewage issues at the pool and in the rooms. Check surrounding hotels for rates before going
30,Worth the money but needs updating and free parking. Without free parking I won’t stay there again. Showers had a little rust n plan sight. No luggage stand no laundry bag in room beds was a little to thin an old but just made the cut. Also could use some new sheets
50,Very Clean and all safety protocols are followed. Staff is exceptional !! Rooms were amazing. I The amenities offered and the location of this hotel made it my best stay so far in Vegas. Check in seemed bleak at first sight because of the line but it moved extremely fast and flowed nicely. All staff were on deck to help get everyone checked in quickly. Then again its also Vegas so who wouldn't expect to have to stand in line at one point or another.
40,The hotel was nice and in a great location. However for the extra money and resort fees the hotel did have any thing in the rooms to accommodate the guest. There wasn't any microwave coffee pot or refrigerator like the other hotels had. I booked this hotel because I was in a group but will not book my next stay.
40,Rooms are clean but the refrigerator was missing and one of the wall outlets were not working. We called the front desk for immediate help but the help arrived 24 hours too late. I still give this place 4 stars for it's good front desk customer service.
10,i saw a blood stain in the bed sheet and there was a clothes from one of the drawer probably from the people of check in before us and i ask for a room service to one of the house keeping and didn't do it
50,"Will cherish the special days of enjoying my ""Love One"" forever while exploring all the changes in Las Vegas!  Luxor has a keen sense of timeless beauty with all the caring staff that has been understanding thoughtful & attentive without giving you the feeling that you're a bother!  It would be my pleasure to recommend the Luxor for any events!"
10,I completed digital check in and the digital key would not work. Staff was rude and unhelpful. Room was unimpressive. Most restaurants and bars were closed for the first few days I was there. Had a wedding group at the hotel and we could not even get to each other’s rooms due to ‘security measures’ of having to have particular room keys to get to each room.
10,Will not be staying here again. Rooms were dirty & not cleaned thoroughly. Trash behind the tv lashes a sock hair & red spill in bathroom wall and floor. We were moved from a room prior because it smelled so bad. Then I paid for parking per day and then if I visited another MGM they made me pay when I was told I wouldn’t.
30,The tv didn’t work all the time and there was a light out in the bathroom. I didn’t complain because my room was compd by mgm resorts because of the slot play I had so I wasn’t to concerned with it at all
20,Won't be back to Vegas until they stop being so scared of the Democrat super killer virus. Almost anything of Interest was closed . The helo flight was pretty good though. If we go back it won't be at luxor though. Too old
10,Sooo sad the Luxor looked amazing but then we arrived waited over an hour to be checked in. Then both my husband and I were bit by bed bugs!! Did not receive clean bedding nor towels our entire 3 night there!!!!
50,The check in counter is far from the parking and there was not any carts to load our luggage onto to assist us to our room. The app was the key to such an efficient check in though it would've been nice to have been pointed in the right direction to our room we went to the wrong tower and walked with our luggage without a cart t
50,Easy smooth no major issues. Went for my daughter and my best friend’s birthday and to see a concert. We enjoyed each day starting with an early visit to the inside Starbucks and dinner at the Luxor restaurants Public House and Diablo’s. We would most definitely stay there again. Best time ever!
30,The rooms were just okay. No refrigerator or microwave. The room looked a little outdated. It was on the strip so that was a plus. I wasted a lot of food and drinks due to not having a refrigerator and microwave.
20,Did not have a room on the floor with family did not have early check in room was filthy plumbing issue. Customer service did the bare minimum to accommodate me and my family. Each representative said different things.
50,I wiuld highly recommend to anyone for a good price and great scenery. Food court and customer service just steps from all exits. Clean rooms and all necessities needed come stocked up. Staff will go the extra mile for you.
50,Great location with tram transport to Excalibur and Mandalay Bay. Monorail available at the Mandalay Bay to access the rest of the Las Vegas strip. Great selection of slots! Would stay there again. Lots of places to eat too!
30,Like the Luxor just not the stay as much.the value is great. Love playing craps there. The ease to grab some coffee or something to eat is awesome but the rooms need a plumbing update. Had two stays with plumbing issues now.
30,The Luxor is an interesting looking building which was why I chose it. However its so big even after 4 days I couldn’t find my way around. I was disappointed that they had 4 pools but only opened one. It was crowded and dirty (dirt leaves masks etc. The worst was someone apparently took off a baby’s diaper and left the contents on the steps to the pool where it sat the whole time i was there. I didn’t even go into the pool it was so disgusting.) The rooms are nice but the shower is poorly designed. There are no towel bars just one hook on the door. The shower has only half a glass door so water pours out all over the floor. I had to use 3 towels on the floor per shower. The drain hole is deep and every time I stepped on it I lost my balance. There are no seats or ledges to prop your foot for shaving etc. The bathroom sink was clogged and despite several requests it was not corrected. The water saving toilets are stupid you have to flush 3 times just to get rid of the paper.Valet service was not available when we checked out and wasn’t offered when we checked in. The place is so big and crowded it will take you a week to figure out where things are. The room had no coffee pot microwave or refrigerator. I guess because of the shape of the building (pyramid) there are only 2 elevators to your room and one was a half mile away! And when it moves it must be on a slight angle because everyone loses their balance. I would not stay there again.
30,The room is clean and comfortable but I had a big issue with my door locker it didn’t open it takes more than 5 hours to resolve it and I had to stayed in a long line for 3 times for the same problem! The hotel is huge I had to walk a lot..All my plans were gone on that night! It takes to long to someone really help me. On The room that they upgrade for me in reason of the issue the internet didn’t work and the bath was broken too.
50,Beautiful location . I always wanted to go and had the opportunity to complete my dream. It was clean and the accommodations were comfortable. I was on the 5th floor and called because I wanted to experience the actual pyramid rooms and the elevator. They moved me without a hassle. I love the feature to unlock room with phone.make sure to get a key in case your phone dies. Luxor is the only hotel I saw with a phone charging kiosk in lobby just in case
20,As indicated on the title I accidentally checked out early on my phone and was charged a $50 early checkout fee. When I called to remedy the situation I was pretty much told to go pound salt. Live and learn but pay attention and don't ever check out early at any MGM property let housekeeping kick you out.
30,Rooms are beautiful but the drains smell of sewage waited over four hours for maintenance to come no one came. When I called front desk they stated the only thing they could do is move our room which the smell still was in the drains.
10,Hotel needs updating. Sink was stopped up. TV didn’t work. Maintenance woke us up at midnight. Carpet was filthy. Overall the hotel is just dark and old. Staff at Mexican cantina was very rude and the food was terrible. I will never stay here again. Paid over $300 to rent pool cabana and the furniture was old and shabby. TV didn’t work in there either.
20,Had issues with the shower not draining well and the ceiling in the bathroom was showing signs of a leak from above and not repaired. Paint was flaking off. The rest of the trip was fine just disappointed in room quality.
50,Luxor turned to be much better than we expected. It’s connected to Mandalay Bay and Excalibur so you can walk around without getting outside. Rooms were updated very clean and smelled clean great shower linen and towels are white good quality and new.
40,Vegas is amazing but SOME of the rooms are not up to standard. I had a suite at the Luxor just recently. Some of the electrical outlets weren't working properly so we had to borrow each other's cord to charge our phone one of the lamps didn't have a light bulb in it one of the lamps was broken and the window was pretty dirty. Other than that everything else was great but I don't know if I will ever stay at the Luxor again.
40,Hotel was clean and the staff friendly. The café was nice. Diablo was ok but stay away from the buffet. We didn't get a chance to go to the pool. The employees at the sportsbook are helpful. The drinks are good and not watered down.
30,Pretty decent hotel overall. Really not worth $400 for 3 nights in my opinion. The food at the pyramid cafe was extremely overpriced and really not great. Casino could have been cleaner. Our room was ok the bed could have used more blankets and pillows. The sheets were paper thin. The bathroom floor got soaking wet every time we used the shower because there was only half of a glass door. This was our second stay and probably our last.
30,Consider paying a little more for a better hotel.. our room was dirty and not properly cleaned over a three day period. Previous occupants hair all over the room was never cleaned nor swept. Wine stains for previous occupants on tile not cleaned.
30,We didn’t go to Vegas to stay in our room the whole day but we would be sleeping and showering there obviously the bed pillows were uncomfortable so no rest and the tub in our room drain very slowly and during the night it would make noises like water was backing up other than that it was ok.
40,Room was very clean and nice…check in and out service was excellent as everything was done on my cell phone which means no lines or room keys…wish the hotel was more in the middle of the strip but location wasn’t that bad.
20,Other hotels have better rooms strip access and overall quality of restaurants. Very disappointing. You can easily find a more enjoyable stay for just a few dollars more. Talking to the staff means nothing they can care less that you are there.
40,It was generally a good experience. However the general maintenance of the facilities were noticeably lacking giving the appearance of a second rate facility. The public bathroom facilities had several faucets and water dispensers not working while sinks either drained slowly (as the one in my room) or were plugged (especially true of the men' bathroom at the main entrance). Also several elevator were not clear and had scuffed up walls.
20,Bathroom in the pyramid was horrible leaky sinks no shower curtain no water pressure a hand held shower head with no place to hang up the attachment. I literally had to hold the shower head the whole time with barely any water coming out of the shower I felt dirty all weekend. The buffet was bland and horrible there. The key card to exit the parking lot did not work. I would not stay here again for the price I paid I would expect to be able to shower properly at the very least!
30,Room was dirty  water would come out the shower and water would get all over bathroom. Sheets had a pretty weird smell and there was no fridge inside the room. Need to upgrade furniture as well…………..
20,The location was chosen due to proximity to the new sports arena; Problems starting at check-in and continuing during our entire stay; We encountered several rude and hostile staff members; The indifference to cleanliness throughout the property is shocking considering pandemic; Everything including the food and drinks were expensive for lackluster service and poor quality.
20,Every time we went back to our room we smelled dog pee and had to step over dog poop that was dried so it was probably there for a few days before we got there where the tv was placed we couldnt watch it from bed I checked in online and clicked we didnt need room service but at 8am when my husband was sleeping in housekeeping wouldnt stop trying to get in until my husband got out of bed and told them to not come in
10,well it's weighing on a lousy customer service you have to wait a long time to talk to someone all right cleaning up to the room very bad room service another important thing is the pool area they close it too early
50,Our stay at the Luxor was fantastic. Every staff member we encountered was super friendly and helpful. Our room in the east tower was the cleanest one we’ve stayed in this year. This was our 4th stay on the strip this year. Housekeeping does a great job. This trip was for my fiancé’s cousin’s wedding & birthday. His family stays at the Luxor every time they go to Vegas and we see why it’s their favorite. Centra the Center bar was a huge hit with our group and honestly the best casino bar we’ve been to anywhere on the strip. It’s such a fun atmosphere at night. It was a staple in our weekend. Everyone had fun gambling. The tram was also super convenient. The only downside of our trip was the pool they only has 1 small pool open on a busy weekend so it of course was crowded but also dirty. Other than that it was overall one of our favorite stays. We’ll definitely be back.
30,Was a good price and on the strip. Room was basic no fridge. But did the job using they room key on the phone was kinda annoying and need it to use elevators so irritating. Pool was nice and the look of the hotel on the outside was really cool. Inside was okay. Also tough that it’s at the bottom of the strip. Would def recommend moving to middle more like Bally’s or flamingo
10,Rooms are old....bathrooms are old.    staff are very room. I was hung up on my staff at parking lot!    Check in way way to long and the staff are very rude. I paid 1800 for 3 days and got treated to weed smoke and rude hotel workers!  I would never stay here again! for 1800 the bathroom should have been cleaner and updated! I saw mold in the shower. Needed to run to Walmart to get bleach before I would even use the bathroom
40,Conveniently located near the new Stadium and of course on the strip. Nice casino great restaurants and if you like sports have big screens to watch the game . Rooms were clean and neat. Definitely recommend
30,You must park first in the garage and then go to lobby to check in. If you want a room in the actual Pyramid you should double check to be placed in the Pyramid or you will be placed in their tower hotels. We were in a room on the 7th floor using Elevator 2 and we didn't have access to internet. We were in the Pyramid Premier 2 Queen bed and the size of the room was really nice. Large enough for a family of 4 and it was comfortable with enough walking space. The pool was a nice surprise as there were 2 parts of the pool area and it was large and plenty of space for kids to swim. Unfortunately they closed the larger pool on Sunday for cleaning and only had a the smaller pool open. It was crowded and packed and my kids missed out on swimming.
20,The hotel itself is decent but the staff and management are very dismissive and rude as they do not care about guest issues. To get ahold of anybody you will be on hold for extensive amounts of times just to be dismissed
10,Amenities close early. Room is an embarrassment the sink didn’t drain. The pool closes at 6. The gym at 5. No coffee maker. No tub. Very poor lighting in the room for makeup. No make up mirror. No fridge in the room. I was very disappointed with my experience
10,Filthy dirty disgusting carpet with huge stains. TV was outdated and super grainy couldn't really even watch anything. No refrigerator in room just big empty drawer that had not been cleaned as there was someone's shirt still left in there. Pillow cases had some questionable stains. Was excited to go to the pool only to find out all pools were closed except for 1. There were hundreds of people shoved into one tiny pool because the other pools had been closed. Long lines to check in...Not satisfied would not stay here again.
30,Room was very clean however the elevators were very far away to get to the casino. No fridge or microwave. Pool very far away. Closed st 6pm..no shade or umbrellas..no literature or I no inside the room.
50,Great location clean our rooms were a good sizebeds were very comfortable hot shower was nice and had a nice view of the pool.Check in and out was easy with mobile app. Lots of quick bites and store collection.
50,We was very pleased with the Luxor check-in was very easy our room was very nice and clean. Everything was very easily located and walking distance to the Raiders football stadium. Cabs were available very early in the morning for the ride to the Airport
40,"I love this hotel and everything about it. I was so happy to stay here. My issues was the lack of house keeping. I took pictures of the nastiness because it was so much that no one would believe I stayed here like that. The word ""I LOVE You"" was written on the mirror. I was there alone so know it was from last guest. The light switches were covered in brown dirt. the tile wall just opposite of the shower had the stains like someone missed the toilet on the wall...toilet was behind said wall...the couch had semen stains and glitter everywhere it looked like a couch from a gay frat house and was in very poor condition. stains all over furniture and bed linen.    I know the first paragraph was very harsh...but I actually love this hotel and would not stay anywhere else...the positives way outweigh the negatives here. I did not come across one unhelpful employee in the hotel my entire stay. my room was cleaned better the second night and I said nothing about the first night dirtiness. the I love you was gone second night. I think I just had an old room. the restaurant's in hotel the casino the shows were all fabulous. I was only in room to sleep and it worked for its purpose. I have stayed here many times and this was my first dirty room and gross furniture.    believe it or not I would definitely stay here again no questions asked and even in a dirty room...well maybe not if the bed was not made anyway...lets not test that theory..."
40,Nice clean room just would of loved some upgrades on USB plugs and accessible charging docks in the room. Overall the suite was nice and clean. It was kept up and no damages of anything that we saw around the room.
30,Hotel left me wanting. Random stains nothing stood out food was mediocre staff was mediocre. Reminded me of 1 and 2 star hotels I stayed at in my youth. The pyramid and mezzanine was neat. Also the elevator.
30,Check in was quick and easy. Gave me a good upgrade. Room was clean and very nice. Buffet very average. Not great selection or taste. Service and food selection at cabana could have been better. Have more blackjack tables open.
20,We love the Casino especially the morning Craps table staff but would probably never stay in the hotel again. The shower drain in so slow in our first room that we had to stop halfway through our showers to prevent the bathroom from flooding over the show stall floor and had to wait a long time to continue because the drain is so slow. In our second room the TV did not work and we asked twice for help. Staff said they would come up to look at it both times but then never showed up. The pool area is beautiful but only one pool was open during our stay. The pool was way too crowded and they brought chairs from the other pools but mixed up the seating arrangements so the servers could not find us to drop off drinks we ordered. It took over 45 minutes to get our drinks. The restaurants and casino are nice and we liked the shows but we do not recommend staying at the hotel at all.
50,Property is pretty far down strip but we like to walk so no bid deal. Rooms were clean and well stocked with amenities. Every employee from the front desk to any of the numerous shops we visited on site were very friendly. Would definitely stay again.
10,As i checked in for my stay i was told that there will be an extra $100 charge on my card due incase of accidentals. As i checked out everything was fine but a few days later i was hit with a $254 charge and no refund. I called the hotel immediately and i was sent to every department. Once they sent me to billing an automated voice came on and said the billing department is closed and will remain closed for further notice. HOW ARE YALL CLOSED BUT YOU CAN HIT ME WITH A CHARGE AND NO EXPLANATION. Never staying here again.
40,Quick $20 taxi ride from the airport. Short walk from hotel to Allegiant Stadium. Fantastic mobile check-in with virtual key so no lines to wait in. Need key (virtual or hard) to access elevator to room areas thus insuring no random people roaming the hallways.
10,Staff was not friendly room was dirty. Will not stay here again! Manager did change our room but it seem it was an inconvenience to do so. They could of handled it differently. Front desk receptionist was extremely rude did not want to hear what I have to say I had to go over him to talk to the manager.
50,Loved the whole experience before I even entered the facility. Looked amazing from the outside! It was clean easily navigated by the signs pisted staff was knowledgeable and available. Lots to see and do.
50,Bell deck was great. Everyone was nice I will be coming back soon We would love to come back in January and bring my 22 year old daughter she’s never been to Vegas. I would feel very safe to bring her to the Luxor
50,It’s always an amazing time staying at the Luxor. The staff is all very helpful with Amy questions you may have. The restaurants are all amazing to eat at. The pools were very clean. I will definitely be staying here again next time!
50,I want to have fun with my friend and i enjoin the hotel and everything the parking lot was good the people they all help when I ask for help they were friendly with me when I arrive to the hotel and they were kind peoples make me go back again
50,The only issue was trying to figure where to park on order to check in which is really just valet or self park. Just no clear signage and no info on their site that I could see. Once we figured it out it was smooth sailing from there! We had a blast!
20,Shower drain was clogged and when they finally came to clean it they left it a mess. TV worked sometimes. Called the front desk took 12 minutes to get someone. Lines to talk to someone were crazy. Pool was filthy.
10,Cold showers an hour check in process  ICE cold buffet at 7am no remote to TV no shower door which made floor wet and slippery. Room was constantly hot and muggy. The rooms air unit barly pushed out cold air. Starbucks took 2 hours for coffee. The pool hours are a JOKE
50,We went to Vegas for a friends’s 30th birthday. The Luxor was great in that it offered everything we needed right there on the grounds. For anything extra we were just a short walk or taxi away. We’ll be back for sure
40,The overall stay was good. Came across and inconvenience but they were able to give us a different room. Other than that there wasn’t any problems. The Luxor staff was able to fix the issue. Recommend staying at this hotel.
30,Check in was ridiculously long we ended up having to do the mobile the but using mobile with the digital keys sucks elevators require them and it's super finicky the room also did not like to use the digital key and it's confusing of where the room is when the numbers don't flow upward newly renovated room but no USB ports and no mini fridge come on guys what decade is this? Also your cell phone reception is nonexistent and there's nothing about what the Wi-Fi situation was so we never used it and all the pools seemed to be closed yet we were still charged a resort fee and nobody makes local phone calls when they're staying in a hotel. The staff was friendly though.
10,Well.. for starters the AC seemed to barely work in and out of the room. The was no safe in the room and the high limit blackjack tables were closed the entire time I was there which is the whole reason I came in the first place. Ive always stayed at the Luxor everytime Ive come to Vegas and have never had the feeling that I should have stayed somewhere else before until now.
40,Luxor is a great value for the price you pay. Service was top notch. Electronic/automated check-in was a bit clunky so assume you need to check-in at the front desk and get a plastic key. The visuals were stunning though I'm surprised that there aren't occasional fatal falls from high interior balconies. The ledge is short and people are drunk. The hotel is at one end of the Strip. That works very well for me but YMMV.
20,AC in the rooms doesnt not work very well. Could only set our room to 65 but it was definitely 73ish degrees all the time. There was a cheese-it on the floor on the hallway the whole stay. Doesn’t seem like it gets cleaned often.
10,There was mold in the shower and a clogged sink. Bodily fluids dried on the bathroom walls. One of the lights were out. Tried to contact the front desk multiple time with no answer. Would not stay here again.
30,My wife and I have been to the Luxor several times and unfortunately the Pyramid rooms and lobbies are dated. We will only stay in the tower rooms from now on and request housekeeping service everyday of our stay.
30,Hotel property was great but giving me occupied room checking in and seeing butt cheeks and being threatened and having to make a run for the elevator than upgrading my stay to a dirty room I was unbelievable I guess what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas great property tho casino was amazing and area was beautiful but that experience was rough
30,Over worked under staffed. The rooms could use some attention. The pool was less the exciting one of them was close making the one other pool extremely crowded. Jesse was great but she eventually had to take a break and we never saw her replacement.
30,The staff was not that friendly I’m a platinum member and I feel like my experience gets worst every time I go to Vegas the rooms are very outdated like they haven’t got any attention since the early 90’s.
50,The Luxor is a great hotel if your in a budget. Rooms rates are great and room quality is great. I’ve stayed here multiple times and will continue to stay here when I travel to Vegas. They have a tram that connects you to other hotels.
50,I have been visiting Las Vegas for 20 plus years. I have stayed at Luxor at least a dozen times and stayed at other M or competitors properties dozens of times as well. Luxor is still unique in design and facility offerings. The entertainment is a bit dated with Carrot Top but AGT is there soon and they are running a one man show with Terry Bradshaw!
30,Room looked and smelled old. Didn’t have safe or fridge. I would only stay at this place in future if I can’t find anything better. Checkin lines were long and although giving all correct info check in from phone wasn’t working.
50,We stayed recently for our 10 year wedding anniversary and we couldn’t have been happier! It is our to go Casino every time we go to Vegas. Thank you for a wonderful anniversary experience to remember
50,My cousins and I stayed at the Luxor Hotel during our trip to Vegas for my birthday bash. The customer service was great and the accommodations were great as well. I would definitely stay here again.
50,Stayed here for a night that I was able to get for free with MyVEGAS rewards. The rooms were excellent and I enjoyed the hotel and casino overall. Paid for early check in and check out; Luxor’s mobile check in/out process is so convenient and easy. My recommendation is to get a physical key card in case your digital key doesn’t work. I along with other guests experienced issues with the digital key on the MGM app but getting a physical card will make your life easier.
20,After taking a bath the pipes got clogged in my room which caused the room to smell like feces even after reporting this to the manager it took them 3 to 4 hours to switch out my room even after the maintenance guy came in and told them how horrible the smell was
50,Great place to stay for the price and very easy walking access to the rest of the strip. Rooms were nice and spacious. Nice bar and restaurant choices. Parking available both above and bbelow ground.
30,Bathrooms need a good cleaning rather than just a quick wipe down. Rooms were decent and price was fair. No coffee pot or fridge in the room. For additional price they would bring one but at minimum a coffee pot would have been great.
50,Convenient to Allegiant Stadium for Monday Night Football. Great atmosphere and friendly staff all around. Top notch. Will stay again because of access to stadium and safe environment for friends and family.
50,"Tower rooms are bright spacious with all marble bathrooms. Perfect shower with excellent water pressure. Very good Samsung 50"" TV. Extremely responsive air conditioning that kept room perfectly chilled. Great location. Huge number of close by restaurants. Fantastic price. Strongly recommend."
40,For the price a really solid option if you want to be near the stadium. Granted it's not as nice as Mandalay or the Delano but it's still pretty nice. Clean room comfortable bed good dining options and walking distance from Allegiant Stadium.
30,I had higher expectations than what I received at the pool. Do better at cleaning the hard to reach areas. Trash just was laying in areas for my whole stay. The guy that checked me in was very helpful.
50,The Luxor is an amazing hotel! I highly recommend it! It offers great shows and a lot of food choices to choose from. Clean room comfy bed nice amenities friendly staff and so much more! Mandalay Bay is connected and offers additional food choices and things to do!
30,Luxor is showing its age. Room wouldn’t cool off. Smelled like smoke. Inclinators (elevators) had main control panels just kind of flopping around/not secure. Casino and shows were great but overall I think this one needs an overhaul.
40,Our initial impression of the hotel was great as we were helped by a wonderful woman who helped save us a lot of time from unnecessarily being in the check-in line and got us our room early. We stayed in the main pyramid not one of the newer towers.  Once we got into our room we checked everything over and noticed that there was no hair dryer in the room. We had to call multiple times over 16 hours to get a hair dryer. It was finally delivered the next day from when we first called.  The water in the sink would get really hot but the water in the shower would only get warm not hot. A bummer after a long day of walking around Vegas!  There was no door or enclosure for the shower only a glass panel that only covered half of the shower so water gets all over the tile bathroom floor. - This is an unsafe slipping hazard!  The deadbolt on the door kept popping out as we would close the door. This caused our room to be open and unsecured for over 4 hours the final night of our stay. - This was seriously stressful and reported to staff.  There is no thermostat for the room only the ability to leave the wall A/C on constantly with no way to regulate the temperature inside other than manually adjusting the unit or turning it off.  Now for the good points: The room was very well insulated and we were as far away from the elevators as we could be. We couldn't hear anything once the door was closed and sleep was very good. I believe it was remodeled recently as well as it was very nice inside with a King bed and lots of ports on the wall to charge devices.  Signage inside was pretty good and things were fairly easy to find.  The in-house restaurant Tender was great and I believe was on par with the what you expect paying at a high-end steakhouse.  Hopefully our experience was an anomaly and these things aren't issues for other guests. I expect that we won't have the same room issues if we were to stay there again.
10,Rude staff rooms need updating - including the rooms listed as updated parking lot and elevator filthy and no drinks served to gamblers. The majority of staff approached didn't seem to enjoy their jobs and always passed the buck to another staff member. Not helpful at all.
50,Check in took awhile because of so many people but moved ok. You can pre-check in thru the app to avoid the check in line.  We stayed in the east tower. The room was very spacious clean and nice. The bed was pleasantly comfortable nice bathroom with a deep tub and a separate shower. Will stay here again.
20,The staff was very uncaring. My room had issue with the bathtub and shower. I called the front desk twice and waited a total of approximately 30 minutes to talk to someone. I was told the first time someone would come check it out. No one came. The second time I was told it was a Hotel water problem. No updates or anything. I had no use of the bathtub or shower for approximately 3 hours. No information or anything else during that time!!!
30,The hotel was mediocre. It served it's purpose for being close to the Allegiance Stadium but we will stay elsewhere next time. The air conditioning was not working and with 104 degree weather that is vital. Our friend's room also didn't have their air conditioning working. It made it very uncomfortable.
10,No matter how cheap it's not worth it. Hotel is old dark and dirty. Drain was stopped up in the bathroom. Floors in rooms and halls were dirty. I left only 2 days into a 15 day stay and moved to another hotel.
10,Luxor Hotel was amazing & innovative when it first opened more than 25 years ago. However the place now reeks of smoke in & out of the guest rooms. As well as the hotel itself. The water in the shower & bathroom sink is severely harsh/hard highly suggest not to gargle or wash in.
10,This was a very disappointing place. It took almost 4 hours to check in. We had early check-in and the first trip to the desk was to tell us to wait until noon. Went back at noon and were checked in but told to wait for a text message with bar code to get our key made at a kiosk.  Each following hour we checked back at the desk looking for the text. We were told we were #2. I had not realized what that really meant. At the 4th hour I stopped someone who went into the system and could not understand why we were not notified. She manually got our room assignment and keys made and issued. Meals at the Luxor were mediocre at best. Food seemed old and poorly prepared. The price for this was astronomical ($200 for dinner for 2).  Housekeeping was deplorable. The room we were assigned was not clean. No glasses no bath towels. Bed did not look changed. The floors were dirty and un-mopped. There was a trail of what looked like urine stains from the toilet out. The hallways were filthy. I purposely placed a straw in the middle of the floor to see how long it would take to be removed. 3 days later it was still there. On exit we were told we could check our bag with the bell hop so we cold walk the casino. The bell hop was less than friendly demanding to know who told us that. We escalated this and were able to check the bag. The checkout app was about the only thing that actually worked. All in all this was a deplorable hotel.
10,The room was very cold due to a old temperature gage. Second the shower door was not extended enough. We had to use several towels in order to keep the floors dry and prevent a fall! If the Luxor is unaware then shame on them
10,I've never been so disappointed in a hotel my entire life. The rooms were shabby cell reception and wifi were God awful.    Hotel does not provide free guest parking.    Unless you're on a really tight budget and want to be on the strip.    Pick somewhere else....I beg you.
30,The Luxor is a great entry hotel for someone who wants to stay on the strip for a value. I love the building and the old school architecture. The old school is also something I dislike because it's dingy af.
10,Roaches in room. We counted 5!!! Absolutely disgusting. We left to drive home at midnight and risked it cause we had a buzz who can sleep with that? NOT US. Never again. I would NOT recommend this to anyone not even if it’s cheap.
30,Corner Suite at Luxor for 2 nights. Pleasantly surprised to find a fridge in the room. The room lacked both a safety latch and a deadbolt. The hallways also didn’t appear to have cameras. Never felt unsafe but this just seems like an oversight in Vegas. Room seemed clean and didn’t show much wear. Directly outside the room however the carpet was coming up and we were constantly tripping on this. Great restaurants.
20,The rooms are outdated and falling apart. The carpet is separating from the floor you may trip and fall because of that. Asked for 2 queen and couch got 2 queen 3 chairs. Staff Didn’t fix the issue
10,Over the Past 20 years I have been to Vegas probably 200+ times and for a remodeled room it looks like they are moving away from resort theme and rooms are worse than before. If you have a Disability that affects your walking almost every escalator was not working (only at MGM resorts). Maybe it's a Covid probably (staffing) but it seems way more dirty. I used to be a Building Engineer for a fortune 500 company and I would of been fired along with the entire staff even property manager for the quality the resort was in. I used to tell people the pyramid room was a need to stay to experience now its a NO NEED TO EVEN GO INTO RESORT. Getting to your room is a 50/50 chance your keep works on key pad in elevator every trip up there was someone if not me with this problem. This review is for September 2021 I will be back in Vegas for the Sema show November 1st threw the 6th and I will see outside their building if they have fixed escalator issues because I won't go inside the resort.
20,I wanted a pyramid room i paid for a pyramid room; and was told they were all booked when i arrived and they “upgraded” me up to a tower room. I said it was fine but i started to get upset when it took me 15+ minutes to get to my room. One of the elevators was malfunctioning so we were stuck at LL for some time. We had to try a different elevator. Then to try and find the “upgraded” room lowest level POSSIBLE and literally next to an exit door that would slam many times during the night. We had an ironing board but with NO iron. Pillows were terrible quality bed very uncomfortable. “Upgrade” more like a downgrade. Will not be returning here unless it’s a pyramid room which we were very excited to be in and Only reason we booked.  Only good thing was that the AC worked.
10,We reported several maintenance issues that were never fixed. They had updated the rooms but still issues. The ceiling was peeling and fell on us in the shower. Exhaust fans in the bathroom didn’t work. Electrical outlets didn’t work. Staff said they’d fix it and provide credit but none of that happened. Asked for only towels and no service. They came in and moved our stuff around and only replaced two towels. The shower spilled on the floor causing a slip hazard. This was not a good experience and we have stayed her 7times prior. Drilling occurred two days at 8am… this is Vegas start later in the day
30,Customer service was not that great when calling front desk for a couple of concerns they never picked up phone. There are no restaurants opened 24 hrs so if u get hungry u wait until the next day. Rooms are so far from everything.
20,I used to really enjoy Luxor and decided to give them another chance...big mistake. My room safe was locked and I waited on hold for 30 minutes to report it. No one told me I needed to request housekeeping...I left a tip that was picked up but did not receive service...why were they in my room?? Finally didn’t use my TV until the second night...it did not work so it took until my final day to get fixed. Room was spacious (tower) and pretty nice...bathroom really showing it’s age.
50,Everything was clean nice & beautiful. the only thing I didn’t like it the shower doesn’t close so you feel the cold or openness. I definitely recommend this hotel & the view from the inside & out was beautiful.
50,My stay at this hotel was A1! The check in process was super easy and the check out process was even easier! The room was amazing. It was my home away from home. The ease of using the digital key and physical room key was a great bonus. I had a lot of fun and the amenities were on point. Definitely will be returning to this hotel on my next Vegas trip!
30,The Hotel was very nice and due the the mandatory mask wearing in the casino with the exception of eating and drinking it was safe. I would recommend to my friends and family if they do not have bad knees.
20,The rooms are not clean pillows had stains tub and towels had hair on them and when I turned the air on my eyes starting burning and my nose got stuffy. As well if your women at night you will get harassed by pimps that’s just standing around in the casino. However the staff was super nice and checking in was super easy and fast.
10,This was the stay from hail a room was not clean properly the toilet didn’t flush properly the sink was backed up there was confetti underneath the chairs the bed had blood on the sheets and all I got was a $25 voucher for two people they did change the linens on the bed and vacuum but the rule was never clean the way it was supposed to be in and there was also here on the bedding as well
30,Found the experience at luxor as just ok. First room was a mess with the soak tub full of the last person's mess and blood on the lap shade near the bed.and im not picky I stayed in some real dives but for the price I expected more.
20,The upgraded room smelled like urine on the carpet and the bed had some sort of soda splash on it. It's horrible having to have that odor hit you everytime you enter your room. I was embarrassed because I picked this hotel for my family. When we went in all the other hotels my family wished I would have booked there.
40,So many problems at the front desk. From wrong room to overcharged on final bill. Wrong food at restaurant twice. TAKE-OUT. Our maids were great and the room was nice just without the view we were promised and waited for over 2 hours.
40,Room a little dirty but it was well priced and nice looking. Just bought some cleaning products and did it myself. Lol staff friendly and helpful. Be sure to find spots that you see a waitress actually in or you'll never get a drink. Lol
30,Hotel was nice and clean. Our tower rooms had good space and kept light out during the daytime. Tv channels kept acting up for 3 days water pressure was going crazy and air was coming out of the shower and sink for 24 hours. Could not shower that day. Pools are super nice but they kept most close and forced everyone into one pool one day and then had more open on another day. Staff was friendly at all times. Took two days to get used to the location of our room.
50,We stayed here for the raiders game room was clean only missing a mini fridge. Overall great experience quick walk over the bridge and everything was close by easily accessible. Pool was really nice and clean
10,Dirty room.  AC didnt work.  Tv didnt work.  Tub filled an inch by past guest.  Smelled like weed in the room.  Overall disappointed. Checked in then checked right backout. We didnt get a full refund nor were we offered to stay in another room.
10,stay away from this place we left the pool to go upstairs n shower to go to a show we spent $320 for show tickets. there was no running water in the shower or tub. no real resolution to our problem...
10,Only spent 1 night. Long lines at check in. Room had BEDBUGS! Both my boyfriend and I had bites up to our knees. Also when you take a shower the glass does not reach far enough so we ended up with a half inch of water in the bathroom. I would not recommend staying here.
50,My friends and I had a wonderful stay at the Luxor Hotel. Being able to check in from our phone was great. We did not have to wait in line at the front desk we were able to go straight to our room after a long flight. Friendly staff and clean room. I’ll stay here again.
50,I really had an amazing time here. The food court was amazing. The accommodations were great. Check in was fast and efficient. And friendly. I had a great time at Luxor. Room was clean and we had the ice machine next to the rooms. There was no view. Buy it didn't matter. The room was for sleep and shower. And a place to rest. Thankfully we achieved just that.
50,Very friendly staff and very comfortable bed! The view was wonderful and hotel is noise free so that I didn’t have any issues sleeping. The food court Public House and other restaurants had a good variety and quality food. I will definitely stay again.
50,It is always great to come and stay here. I love the comflrtable beds the environment the staff were all great from the front desk to house keeping. All of our wants and needs were taken care of! Will definitely come back a 3rd time!
20,"Rooms don't get cold. Fee for refrigerator fees for booking with outside booking agency. Lots of fees. Drinks by the pool were $30 and $27 for a refill. An alarm went off at 5 am waking us a friend stated swat was on there floor removing a guest but alarm only stated ""minor"" incident is being investigated."
20,The rooms were nice and clean but the staff were rude  they had bad attitude wasn’t trying answer my questions. Different stories were being told to me  I don’t understand how it’s a glitch in the computer when they didn’t give me my 200 back they only gave me 121 but they charged me 100 deposit when I got there  then at 2:42 am they charged my card 159 and said it was for the deposit but they had already took it out for the deposit.
50,My stay was quite comfortable. I got an upgraded room that helped my girlfriend and I enjoy our stay so much more than we would’ve with our regular room. So clean and the staff was friendly and eager to help!
30,The casino portion and staff are amazing but my suit was less than to be desired as there where allot of issues nothing worth walking out over but otherwise a amazing casino and amazing interior and great food as well
10,I got to the hotel expecting to get a suite which was what was booked before hand and I ended up getting a regular room and even showed my itenary showing that a had a suite and they did nothing to fix my problem and was even rude about it.
50,Luxor stay The staff and cleanses of the hotel was awesome. Although we could have used a refrigerator in the room and a microwave. As we bought food back and could not heat it up the food. The stay was well
20,My rooms where dirty the staff was very much rude. Every other walk way was broken down. The whole entire experience was awful. I will never come back here nor will I recommend. Not how I wanted to spend my 21st.
50,I was responsible for kicking off our Class of 81 40th High School 2021 reunion in Las Vegas. My Alumni class met in my suite for a bite a drink and for pictures. The hotel accommodations made a forever lasting impact of the best reunion ever from all.
50,Great location especially if you are going to a Raiders game. Central location to the strip and the staff is incredibly friendly. Nice shopping options and really good pool/gym onsite. Close to everything!
40,The place is okay for staying a few days and get to know Las Vegas. However there some nicer hotels with better amenities than this one. So you decide what is in your budget and choose wisely. This hotel rooms needs some updating in my opinion.
20,I think that the promo rates rooms online is not what you get when you show up. Our room was not cleaned prior guest stuff was still in the room. Maybe a shortage of employees. Or just a dirty maid that halfway cleaned. Bed sheets was not changed but just spread back out. I think the hotel is not for sleeping in unless you are a prostitute or just a dirty person.
30,Bed was comfortable and clean. Room was dusty though and a little dated. Bring your USB wall charger. Wait at the elevators was not bad for being on the 27th floor. Plenty of things to see and do in the area. If you like to casino hop the access to other casinos was easy. Staff was friendly. Renting a cabana for the day at the pool was a great choice just reserve ahead of time or you will pay last minute pricing.
50,Had a good vacation with family rooms are spacious and clean however if you are a hot sleeper I might suggest bringing a fan as the air doesn’t cycle through the room that well and it gets to be stuffy even with the ac at full blast
10,When we arrived we were so excited to use the new app to check in park get up the elevator and get into our room all quickly and easily. Unfortunately the app failed at every step once we arrived. Before we got to the hotel we were able to successfully check in and get our room number. However when we tried to open the app at the entrance to the lower level of the parking garage it failed to function despite having 5 bars of service. So we could not open the gate with our prepaid parking and had to take a ticket. Then after parking we went to the elevator and found we once again needed the app to function to get to our floor. But again the app failed to open this time because of no service in the elevator. After fighting the app for quite a while and riding up and down to random floors we stepped off the elevator to get the app to work. But as soon as we stepped back on the elevator the app would no longer work. But alas we ended up at our floor thanks to another guest. Then off to our room but once again the app failed to retrieve our reservation information. After multiple resets of my phone and much cursing we gave up and went to the front desk to wait in a long line to get real keys. We could not use the mobile app check in line because once again the app wouldn't retrieve our reservation information. As we spoke with the desk agent they apologized and at the same time recommended that we take a screenshot of our parking pass barcode so we could retrieve it when needed. That was the best advice because we needed it multiple times and the app failed us each time. Overall the trip had a horrendous start and thanks to the MGM App and we will not be staying at the Luxor again. Oh and the fire alarm went off for 20min at 5am the last night of our stay.
40,Still the best bang for the buck on the strip. They truly take care of their long time guests. Always love the Luxor swag It has the best merch theme. Always gift shop bound. Vegas has gone through some though times but it still around . 2020 Vegas was a great escape from Cali and the Luxor was part of it.
20,Poor attention to cleaning details blood and desert stains in the bed filthy toilet with hairs and urine on the seat. The aromatherapy system did not work and was covered in dust. Comfortable mattress
30,For the money… I’d rather spend more and stay at the Wynn or somewhere that has quality everything. The food was below average the rooms are being to look wore and the casino seem boring. Location is perfect for the stadium.
40,Arrived on Sunday before Labor Day. We self-parked and had no problems but it is a bit of a walk to hotel lobby. My jaw dropped when I saw how long the check in line was. They had workers trying to direct people to different lines but it was very unorganized. Thankfully I had the MGM app on my phone and I could use the kiosk to check in and print keys. All done in 5 minutes. Saw people on the elevator that were complaining about standing in line for over an hour to check in. If you are going to stay here *** PUT THE APP ON YOUR PHONE ***.  Our room was on the 9th floor in the pyramid. It was very clean and comfortable. Bathroom was large with a walkin shower. Room had a fridge and safe and a view of the pool area. Housekeeping came everyday while we were out.  The pool was not that crowded and there were only a few kids in the pool and there was no load music so it was peaceful and relaxing. Drinks at the pool are outrageously expensive so we drank free water from the bar when we were thirsty. Pool closes at 6 which sucks as it was still over 100 and an extra hour would have been nice.  I liked the layout of the casino and drink service was above average. I even had a couple of $200 wins on the Jurassic Park slot machines.  We did not try any of the restaurants as we had a car and prefer off=strip where it is much cheaper.  I was a little nervous about staying her with some of the subpar reviews but I was very happy and would stay here again.
10,I reserved an ada room and was not given one at all and they refused to move me. The bathroom was not even remotely accessible and the doorway was barely wide enough for my wheelchair to get in. I also needed a fridge for medicine and I called the front desk and they said they would put in a order for it yet they never brought it no matter how many times I called
30,1st room tub backed up after 9 hours still didnt drain 2nd room ac wasnt 100% so they replaced the filter didnt help much had to ask for fans then last day before we check out keys quit working a little pain in the ass
40,Halls we're very noisy and doors slammed constantly. Pool area was very nice but needed to have more pools open. Bathrooms were hard to find and not enough of them. One bathroom was closed almost the whole time. It didn't seem like there was much security either.
50,Room was very clean and spacious. Nice staff. Beds were comfortable. Plenty of parking. I like that there were security strolling the parking lots. One of the pools was closed. Diablo cantina could be a little more courteous.
50,Good price and an easy 15 minute walk to the raiders stadium. I will definitely be back. Just beware they have no mini fridge bring a cooler. Other than that the price was good for what you get. It's right at the beginning of the strip so they traffic isn't too bad to park.
20,To be honest if you treat it like just a place to sleep even that isn’t enough. The first room we were provided was absolutely disgusting. Hair balls in the shower and tub body hair i and on the toilet and sink and bed. It smelled like sweat and humidity along with questionable stains on the wall carpet and bed frames.  Second room was ok it seemed clean at first but the ac was horrible even at the lowest temperature it was hot and humid and sticky. Then the last night we notice the mold and red stains on the ceiling. I will not stay again.
30,I was not satisfied with the parking situation. You have to almost a mile to get to your vehicle. And coming in and out was a hassle as well. They should have the parking fee included in your room and it should be on your room key. Or available through the app.
20,I sat in poop on the toilet after check in hair on the floor blood and on vanity. Upgraded rooms and the tub backed up into the shower. Tried to up-charge for the upgraded room upon checkout! Publix has the best wings! I’ll walk through Luxor just to go to Obag their purses are AWESOME Happy Anniversary to us!
10,We will never stay here again. We had issues from day 1. Shower wouldn't drain maintenance never came. Elevators took you to random floors regardless of which button you pushed. So disappointing and such a waste of money. Pools not open after dark no mini fridge/microwave/coffee pot in the room. Only half a shower door which meant water everywhere any time you showered. And because of the drain not working you had to turn the shower off halfway through to let it drain so it wouldn't overflow and flood the bathroom. Which meant standing there freezing wet until it drained enough to finish your shower. Our first room keys didn't work in the parking garage and we had to call someone to let us out and then get new keys when we came back. Those new keys didn't work for the elevators so we had to go back to the front desk to get them reset AGAIN. My partner got stuck in the elevator for 15 minutes trying to get to the floor he selected. Our friends elderly mother was stuck for 30 minutes trying to get to the floor she selected. It was absolutely ridiculous. Especially when you consider the fact that you are charged a 'resort fee' per night for who knows what because they is nothing about that place that is 'resort quality'. We will NEVER stay there again. Probably wouldn't even step foot in there to gamble either. It really made our getaway so stressful instead of relaxing.
30,room not clean there was no fridge in our room the AC made an awful noise pillows super uncomfortable shower don't have a door everything gets wet. The casino was ok not as full as others hotel is at the very beginning of the strip far from the movement. you have to walk a lot from the parking to the lobby elevators are very moody did not pleased me.
30,We stayed for 5 nights and six days and housekeeping came to our room only on two days. Had to call house keeping to get fresh towels and there was no microwave to warm up any of our food that we had purchased at the Luxor. I had stayed here for me and my husbands birthday and had invited friends and family that came to celebrate with us and they stayed at the Luxor as well. NEVER AGAIN. We were on the six floor taking elevator 2B. I thought at one point we were gonna get stuck in the elevator. The hallway to our room was moldy smelling and looked like it had been leaking on the ceiling.
40,Didn’t get a good night sleep due to loud people next door but it Vegas but man thin walls I guess and only one restaurant was open long very long line to get something to eat after the RAIDERS GAME.plan ahead next time some food places closed early
50,Great atmosphere excellent food friendly staff clean rooms and a lot of fun! Enjoyed shows as well. Definitely staying at Luxor again. Highly recommend staying there during your next Las Vegas vacation
20,Just not a good first experience with Luxor. At first they couldn’t find reservation. Then the room we did get had food under the mattress with stains and dust everywhere. Then tried to charge us extra money to switch rooms
10,Clogged shower drain had to turn off water multiple times to not over flow the the 6 inch deep standing shower.  No shower door or curtains creates puddles water pressure is too high has to be faced at the wall  AC is terrible room felt moist no way to turn it down.
10,"This is the worst MGM property I have stayed in. A/C was pathetic had to pay for a basic amenity refrigerator. No microwave. Room was suppose to be upgraded premium but it is far from it. Was there for our anniversary and just a horrible ""Resort"" ... Not!!"
20,They would not price match to their own website  We used their mobile check-in app at 9am day of but our room wasn’t ready until an hour after actual check in.  Wet carpet inside the door reported it but no one came to check it. We used a towel to soak it up each day
30,"This hotel while it could definitely use some remodeling/updating was actually a pretty nice place to stay for my first adult trip to Vegas (happy birthday to me!). I got nervous ahead of time after reading some of the reviews but was glad we stayed here anyway. There are some really cool pros but there are some cons as well...    Pros:  1. We got checked in even earlier than the early check in we paid for so that was super nice. (Thank you Kitty!)  2. The soaking tub in the room worked well and overlooked the view of the Stadium and mountains.  3. The room was huge! There was so much space to move around in (nearly the space of a small house!).  4. The casino area was really nice and the hotel was decorated with beautiful Egyptian themed deco.  5. There were lots of eating options that I though were pretty affordable (and two Starbucks!!).  6. This may seem odd to put this in the ""pro"" category but I loved the ""inclinator"" elevator (how else do you get an elevator up slanted walls?!) and even the minor vertigo issue while swinging side to side was actually kinda cool (maybe even more so after a few!). *wink    Cons:  - The few outlets were awkwardly placed and we didn't find any USB chargers.  - The bathroom. Enough said. For the size of the room this was a huge disappointment! There wasn't a fan the flickering lights above the sink triggered my vertigo the really good sized two-person shower had no place to put shampoo etc except on the floor the showerhead was broken and wouldn't stay aimed anywhere except the drain but it had super hard water pressure and the shower leaked through the wall onto the floor in the room.  - It is close to the airport (we never heard any airplanes) and it's also on the south end of the Strip so it seemed to me to be ""quieter."" Be prepared to walk (honestly I didn't mind that so much).  - There are areas throughout the property that smell of marijuana.    Overall: I would stay here again myself and I do recommend it to travelers however I might opt to stay somewhere closer to the middle of the Strip next time to have more of the ""Vegas"" noise."
30,The rooms where not the best Condition. I walked in the hotel room and the floors were sticky. I go into the bathroom and the towels that the hotel provided were stained. Every time I took a shower the floor got wet because of no door
20,Filthy hotel and casino. Rooms are ok but walls paper thin. Air is stale in casino and rooms. Woke up congested each morning. Pool was gross main pool was shut down. Escalators broken. I know this is one of the cheaper hotels on the strip but NYNY and even Excalibur would be better choices.will never be back.
10,Tower and pyramid rooms were horrible not clean. Pyramid room had a dirty tub and the room smelled. Got upgraded to the tower and it was dirt and red stains all over the carpet room was lights were dim wouldn’t get any brighter I assume so u couldn’t notice the imperfections
40,The buffet is the best for the price the hotel rooms and halls needs some improvement the showers need glass doors. The price for the room can be great depending on the time of year but the resort fees can get pricey
50,Went to Las Vegas to celebrate my birthday. Had the Tower Elite King Room. Had a refrigerator. Comfortable room. The only thing was missing was microwave. Other than that had a great time. Will be coming back in the near future....
40,It would be nice if parking was closer. Everything else was great. Would’ve liked to dine at the steakhouse but it was understaffed. Joined the MGM players club. Hope to get some comps! Room was great. Fifty dollars is too much for a pet fee.
10,Spend your money elsewhere. This was the worst hotel I’ve ever stayed in during my many trips to Vegas. If it’s cheaper There’s a reason for that. We had two dirty rooms what looked like a roach in the shower of one of them also a moth in the bedroom. Old jellybeans from previous ppl along the floor by our bed. And we had to beg for towels to wash up with and those took between 25-30 mins.
10,The place is beginning to be a dump quickly. The staff doesn’t clean the room well. My shower stall begins to fill up as soon as you start the shower so it’s very evident to anyone cleaning if they did clean that the drain needed to be cleared. So of course there’s mold around the shower stall. The shower stall itself actually leaks out onto the floor tiles. They hang a huge bud lite sign on one side of the pyramid and naturally when the wind blows the huge sign the ropes that holds the sign up will slam did I say slam against the windows and it first happened when I was asleep. Try figuring out what that could possibly be from inside the room looking through the tinted glass. Not good.
40,The hotel was super close to the stadium. The staff was friendly. The rooms do not have a refrigerator or microwave. And to get a drink while playing the machines is almost impossible. Other than that it was okay.
10,I am a Gold card holder and will never recommend Luxor. When I booked my reservation it was for 4 nights and when I checked out was told that it was only for 3 nights and had to pay for Thursday night. That it was a black out date. That was unacceptable I was never told that. I moved out of the East Tower Room too the pyramid room cause I needed two queen beds. Which was also a cheaper room. Very disappointed 😥
10,Very dirty didn’t like it somebody didn’t replace my shower gel or soap shower was dirty floor was dirty  I felt unsafe while walking down the hallway because of the railings and food was nasty and unpleasant
40,Luxor is the perfect location for Raiders fans and is reasonably priced. I would recommend it for anyone who wants to attend a game. Casino and security staff were very pleasant and helpful to deal with.
40,We used travelocity to book our vacation to the Luxor. All was good...until we arrived at the desk to check in early had to pay $20. The lady who checked is in told us they don't upgrade rooms anymore. Even though it was my 60th Birthday Army Veteran and Cancer survivor...we said OK. We went to our room inside the pyramid. It was returned but not by much. My wife was not happy with the room. We called down to the front desk we returned to the front desk and got a different person. This older gentleman was very understanding and pleasant. He upgraded us to the east Tower. Wow!!! No upcharge!!! Thank you!!!
50,Stayed there to attend a raiders game. Location can't be beat and the accommodations are excellent for the price. I will definitely be back for future games I plan on attending and recommend it to anyone else going.
50,Service was impeccable. The staff was vary helpful. Rooms were top notch. Everyone was nice and friendly. Everything was within walking distance. Will definitely be visiting Vegas again and staying at the LUXOR.
30,Average hotel rooms are a bit outdated. Service was good rooms were cleaned everyday. Carpet and paint seemed to show its age. Location is a far from the strip parking garage took 15 minutes to leave one evening due to a malfunction on the exit ticket machine.
50,Its very rare that I provide a 5 star recommendation in every category for a resort hotel yet our stay at the Luxor was excellent from start to finish! We were there for 4 nights 5 days with a party of 20 people. Every room was graciously appointed for each party and accommodations were made for different check-in and check-out times according to our flights. BEST of all the PRICE! Best rate on the strip for a prime weekend (Labor Day) with a football game and concerts to drive prices even higher.
30,Issue with water not draining in shower and sink had to shower in water up to my ankles and brush my teeth with sink full of water. called 3 times and issue was not fixed. also stayed 2 nights and room was not cleaned or clean towels provided without me calling
20,I have arrived to stay at the Luxor on Thursday at 2am only to find rude staff. Not very friendly. Unfortunately the app was down so I couldn’t use it to open my room door. Going down to get help but that was just awful service.
40,Overall a good experience. Our room was off the beaten path to get too. The hotel is far down the strip meaning a long walk to many places. However it was clean and comfortable and I would stay again.
40,We stayed here for one night in September. We had a comp offer from Mlife that included free play and resort credit.    We booked the 1-bedroom tower suite. We attempted to check in around 12:00pm but we were told they had no rooms ready. We came back to check in around 2:30pm and the line was insane!! thankfully they have a separate line for Mlife Gold & up and we were about 4th or 5th in line.    Check in took a little bit longer than usual but the lady was friendly and got us a room in the west tower on the 9th floor.    Easy to get to the elevators from the check in desk. This area brings you past the pool entrance. Seems the hallways and such have been renovated.    The room was really quite nice and much better than I expected for the Luxor. If this room was offered again we would stay here longer. I am not a fan of the location but was happy with what was on offer in the hotel.    The room is a good size. Has a seating area with table wet bar and fridge for your personal use. Then there is also a seating area with couch and chairs plus a tv. In the bedroom you have your normal items - bed dresser desk and tv. The bathroom is where the room shows some age but is large. It has double sinks a soaker tub and a stand-alone shower.    Our view looked out to the Excalibur and T-Mobile. You could see and hear the pool party at Excalibur in the room but of course that's not an issue at night time.    There wasn't a little mask care package in this room that we had received during a recent stay at the Mirage.    Overall I was really impressed with the room. The casino was lively but not packed. There was enough on offer that even though the location isn't ideal you don't feel secluded.
30,- a bit over priced considering the rooms. Staff was cool. when making the reservations the $50 per day hold should be mentioned as well. It was shocking to learn my spending money was snatched out of my account for this.
50,Very satisfied stay super nice front desk housekeeping on point. Comfortable sleeping super nice strip view. Good and Different elevators experience. I will definitely go back to stay with my children's. Thank you!!
30,There was no showerhead in our room in the shower wand was left dangling over a rail you had to take a shower with one hand and use the other hand to wash. Before also flooded because I didn’t properly install the tile so that it would run down the train so every time you took a shower you had to mop the floor up with towels. I’m not sure how this really been passed inspection without a functioning shower or with the drainage issues in the shower stall
50,Always a great place to relax or have fun. Casino has tons of gaming options and guest rooms are really nice. We always choose to stay at Luxor while vacationing in Vegas. We will definitely be visiting again!
20,Dirty carpets in our room! Bad A/C that didn't work well. Very uncomfortable beds. Dark and dingy rooms that stunk of old stail smoke smell. Very overpriced good food in the restaurant that we ate at. Good service though.
10,Stay away old run down rooms ghetto no parking  if you want to park at the premises it’s $30 a night . Might as well stay elsewhere for that much . I won’t ever stay here again. Do yourself a favor and stay away from here
30,They need to fix the loud noise that was happening on the second floor. We could not get any sleep at night. I would not stay here again unless they offer me compensation for a terrible room or offer me a free stay.
30,Great rates; average rooms. I love the casino and all the amenities inside. The rooms still leave a lot to be desired as compared to the other rooms. The pyramid rooms are average the tower is better.
10,We stayed at The Luxor Hotel for J Balvin festival for 3 days and during our check in the service was terrible I tried to talk with the supervisor and was even worse. They did not let us in to our room already paid because all the people on the room was not there. So we did not have a room until next day that the people arrived.  Otherwise the hotel was ok and everything but the staff 0 points.
50,Quick and friendly check in. Clean rooms. Great location to allegiant stadium. Hotel was packed and great drinks service at tables and slots. Bartenders I came across did a great job in keeping everyone happy. Loved the Raiders decor everywhere
20,The room leaked we told the front they only gave us one day resort fee refund didn't change rooms the pool is not like picture and only 2 pools open a lot of the restaurants close early all are close by 11.
10,Didn't do anything they said! Wouldn't allow me to use my rewards.The manger was very rude to me about it. Told me there was nothing he was going to do. Horrible customer service.  House keeping cut so many corners in our room.
40,Walking across the bridge to Allegiant takes about 10-15 minutes but is very convenient to just walk back after the game and be at your hotel. Many Raider fans there so a lot of fun! Would stay here for any event at the stadium
30,It was an average hotel experience checking in was a pain as their app was not working no mini fridge in hotel room bc they want u to pay $13+ a meal in the food court. Everything overpriced and nothing seems to be included.
10,The AC in my room was broken. We were switched three times to 3 different rooms and none of them worked or blew cold air. After the 3rd switch i gave up literally. To get on the elevator you have to scan your room key and it took about 20 scans for it to recognize the room key. I made sure it wasn’t my key since other guests experienced the same issue. The carpets smelled horrible in the hallway. The staff seems bothered all the time. Never again. If i was paid to stay there I would refuse that offer.
10,Management was extremely rude. Does not have any interpersonal skills. No refrigerator microwave or coffee machine in any room. My friends room flooded and it took 2 days for them to switch her room. Unacceptable. I'll never stay there again mainly because of the way I was treated by Management. The rest I could get over.
10,I couldn't believe what i had step into. Like out of a horror movie.  after the covid-19 outbreak cleanliness should be the hotel number one priority. the hotel don't value there room. i will never stay
10,Booked a two bedroom suite and the hotel only had a one bedroom. Attempted resolution and was told there was nothing they could do. Then when I tried to speak to a supervisor after the trip I was connected to a non functioning phone extension after being on hold for 20 minutes. Talk about the run around. I've stayed at this hotel several times but after this experience I will not return.
10,Got food poisoning from the buffet never received clean towels emergency alarm went off at 5 am had to pay for parking every time i left the parking structure overpriced and will never return to this casino
10,I am extremely disappointed in my trip. Upon arriving at the airport we learned that the airport shuttles price gouge and a taxi or Uber is the only way to travel in Las Vegas. Once we arrived at the Luxor we were immediately approached by a smooth talking sales man who was trying to get us to sit through a 3 hour high sales timeshare presentation with the lure of hotel vouchers and a free 2 day vacation. We would of had to lie and say we were married etc to participate. I was very insulted by the sneakiness of the staff. Checking in was easy with the digital key maker. When we found our room with no one to help we were again disappointed by the room condition. Our view was a concrete wall. I booked a PREMIUM king room and got a subpar double Queen. The bathroom still had some sort of human waste on it someone else hair was on the counter no coffee maker no fridge and we found the safe finally on the 3rd day of our trip. I had not traveled to Las Vegas in 20 years and there has been an awful change. Homeless everywhere even in the hotel vomit in the walkways the overwhelming smell of marijuana and the fact that a simple club soda is 3 dollars! Expensive to drink eat and survive in this town and the hotel did nothing to alleviate this situation. Now there are “resort fees” on top of the hotel! These were not for my convenience I was not using the fitness center or whatever these resort fees are for. I didn’t even get a free breakfast. I will not return to the Luxor
20,We knew that we had to pay 150ish dollars in resort fees but we and the other two couples we were with got hit with an extra 200.00 amenities fee we weren’t expecting. Apparently no one was expecting seeing as how check in was really backed up at noon on a Thursday. Our and friends a/c would cut off and not come back and was tired of waking up sweaty. Fire alarm went off at 5am and was a false alarm after 15 minutes of piercing howling noises. Apparently this is a common occurrence at this hotel. Food selection within the hotel was lackluster in selection and quality not to mention a lot more expensive than many others I’ve stayed at before. Also work on the outside of the hotel throughout the night. Workers were rappelling down the side of the hotel with no regard as to how much noise they were making and kept my wife and I up at night.
30,Too many drunkards argue fight smoke in neighboring rooms. First night was a barking whining dog then the drunks moved in and security had to come. After that the smokers checked in. West Tower seems outdated. Was disappointed and exhausted from the drama.
10,The beds were dirty. After walking around without shoes my feet were black. The sheets were never washed and only folded. I asked the front desk for a refund and they told me no they said that it’s too late. I had to stay in a friends room because my room was bad. I will never stay here again
50,My husband and I had a great trip for our anniversary the room was very clean and the bed was extra comfortable! The pool area is also very near! Any time we saw staff they were very friendly. We would definitely stay here again.
10,Stayed at this hotel before with no issues but this past weekend was bad ….. First sink and shower had bad drainage…. You couldn’t take back to back showers or else the water would overflow …. Had to wait 10 minutes for the next person to shower. To make things worse room 16-067 is placed next to a service corridor and a towel/ linen room so there was constant banging of carts throughout the day and night. Since it was a Raider game on Monday  there was nowhere to move is according to desk person ….
30,The shower design has no shower door which allows water to get all over the floor when showering. There was no rails or handles in the shower to hold on to in the event someone slipped in the shower. There were absolutely no towel racks so after using a towel or face cloth I had to lay them on the counter. The air conditioner in my room blew air which was barely cool so the room remain a bit warm the entire stay.
10,Checked in to room room was dirty and I spotted bedbugs on top of my sheets. Called front desk and they told me I needed to go back downstairs and check in again to get a new room. There was no urgency at front desk and I told them that I felt they weren’t taking this seriously. She gave me a different room whereby I asked for a manager to give me a call at his/her convenience. I received no phone call and checked out to another hotel. I was spending 15 days at Luxor and didn’t feel that they cared a bit. Franklin at front desk was the only person that took this seriously.
10,There was literal poop on the floor of the hotel. My kids almost ran into it if it wasn’t for a man standing outside warning us we would’ve ran right into it. Called guest services and they were less than empathetic. On top of that the shower didn’t work. That also wasn’t fixed.
40,Room was large for the price. Staff was very friendly and efficient including valet parking and Bell Desk. Had an issue with the order of a rolloway bed that was resolved the next day. Housekeeping staff was excellent. Loved the pool area and proximity to other hotels.
20,As I stated before I had high expectations and was disappointed at the service and attentiveness of staff. As a visitor or other MGM Properties they treated me way better. Sadly nothing is worth staying anything South of Excalibur.
10,This hotel used to be great! The decor used to be gold with Egyptian theme. Now it is a beige and has a Radiers theme. All the Los Angeles Ghetto people go here! Seriously! I swear we even saw a guy in a wheel chair with huge lightup speakers blasting his rap music so loud you could not hear anything else around you! This was inside the casino. Security was too scared to approach!
30,Room was never cleaned. Staff member asked if I would like room service took down information. Had to reach out for fresh towels and noticed room was never cleaned. No trash was ever collected. Did my best to manage the waste.
50,Always a good time here    Friendly staff decent food great rooms    I love being able to leave me luggage with the bell hop on the daily too    The security helped me find a lost item I left behind in my room
10,We checked into our room then extended a 2nd day. Then I ordered an upgraded room and they checked us into that room and told us to go ahead and get our things and move rooms. While I was changing and packing up for our new room a couple walks in with their own keys and had been checked into that room. Extreme embarrassment. My husband went down to let them know and I packed up and went to meet him so we could go to our new room. That was after I was at the front t desk for an hour trying to get checked into that new room. They had already charged me which I proved on my bank account and the manager still told her to charge me. Then we go to our new room and it was obvious someone had already been in. There. Say on hold for 35 mins to talk to front desk and then maintenance knocks and says that he was called there over an hour ago because of a water leak. So we were told we needed to go back to front desk to get another room because maintenance needed to work on the room. So we go down and talk to them and they upgrade us to another room so we go back up to get our things because at this point it’s been a four hour process and we missed our sports bets as well as football. And they had locked our keys out. We then had to go get keys made to retrieve our belongings for the new room and walk all the way back up and get our stuff and go to the new room and yes it was an upgrade but it was filthy. My husband had to take a cold shower as we don’t get hot water. The refrigerator was disgusting. Coffee maker. No coffee. And then we extended this morning because we are going ro raiders game and it’s my sons 15th birthday and we were told all resort fees and parking would be waived but the lady on the phone was so rude and said that was not true. So honestly I have pics of everything. I’m not one to complain ever but this is rediculous. My husband and I have medical issues and lost our whole day yesterday due to all the problems. I have severe chronic pain from arthritis and neuropathy and I could barely walk last night after all this. Just was at umc a few days before we came here and we are locals. I’ve worked in the casino and customer service industry my whole life. Supervised a front desk and was an auditor. When something like this happened to my guests I would never have treated them the way we have been treated. I would have done everything in my power to make sure they were happy.
30,I would stay somewhere else next time. The hotel smelled of waste the bathroom got water everywhere because of the short shower door and there isn't enough elevators. The hotel staff was really nice overall and the hotel was cool but not very functional.
30,Limited places to eat and hours. Not much in walking distance. Far end of the strip. Pool closed at 6pm. East rooms are super hot. Had to be moved to the west tower. no refrigerator or microwave in the premier king room. If you don't want to be in line for a hour please download the app to do a mobile check in.
30,Room was ok there was mold in the bathtub and when I drained the bathtub the shower filled with black liquid. Also had to leave a day early due to an emergency and could never get a hold of a real person to cancel my last night.
30,I get it’s an older casino but needs major updates ……. Food court could definitely be better. The cigarette smoke was a drag! Also I never really noticed much security around the hotels areas. Issues with keys also and app connection
50,We had a wonderful stay. The staff was very nice and welcoming. Great hospitality. Fun atmosphere. Didn’t spend a lot of time in our room other than to sleep but the casino had so much to offer. It was an amazing trip!
30,Old and pricey for being located at the end of the strip so everything's a long walk. Next time will spend the extra money and stay at the Bellagio or the cosmopolitan they are cleaner and located more in the center of the strip.
30,Maybe it was just bit of bad luck but the shower had no door so showers were difficult and made a mess. Pretty sure we got room service but on one side of the room only and the sheets seemed not clean.
10,It was not a safe and clean place for my family. Special in this COVID 19 situation. I called to solve a problem but nobody cares and if they couldn’t fix it they could recommend to us a new room with no problems. Because I called exactly when I check in in at room.
10,Needs a deep cleaning. The beds were terrible the pillows old and cheap. The showers rusty and the sink didn't drain. This place has gone severely down hill in recent years. I've heard rumors of demolition maybe it's time.
50,Early checkin was the best because I arrived super early and wanted to relax a bit they got me in far before normal 3pm check-in. Also enjoyed the Egyptian theme been to Vegas a bunch but never to Luxor for some reason. Thanks Luxor!
10,I still here because it was convenient for me but I will never return. The smell was horrible they don’t clean well and staff was never available. So I had to figure everything out for myself. It was the worst birthday trip ever.
10,No amenities like coffee potfridge rude waitresses the reward card to complicated to use you got to use your own money in order to get your free play you accumulate expensive store inside $7.00 for a Pepsi $12.00 pack of cigarettes
10,I was stuck in an elevator for 10 to 15 mins in the dark because the card reader wasn't working tried the emergency call button and nothing I had to wait until another guest used the elevator to get out
10,The Luxor unlike the great pyramids of Egypt has not stood the test of time. The hotel is worn down in general with wall paper peeling from the hallway walls and sticky floors. What’s worse is the guest rooms look like something out of a bad roadside Motel rather than a supposed luxury hotel on the Vegas strip. Complete with permanent toilet stains and dirty floors the room is nice only when compared to a jail cell. Time to tear this pyramid down and build something better.
20,Check in took way too long incorrect booking via web site charged full price for non alcoholic drinks dated rooms with popcorn ceiling only good food was @ Tender dated and mediocre shows lacking.
40,Had a great time and received great hospitality from the Staff at Luxor. Will continue to make this my first pick of places to stay in Vegas. They go above and beyond expectations. Also great service from the Front desk
20,It was a business trip that we tried to see a few places on our own time.  If you are new to Vegas just understand everything is way over priced quality is compromised. It's all about getting you into the casinos.
50,This hotel is in a wonderful location. You have an easy walk to Mandalay Bay Excalibur New York New York and MGM Grand where you can grab the monorail. The rooms have always been clean and comfortable this is a great hotel for the price.
40,it was good better this time but i was charged charges on my room for valet and etc that i did not do i really would like my money back for the extra charges because i did not do that but idk if it’ll get solved
40,The convenience of the monorail and the connection to the Excalibur without having to leave the building was great. The value of the rooms for the price was excellent and the service and professionalism of staff was fantastic.
30,We stayed here early September and had two rooms. AC ran non stop to barely keep room cool. WiFi on the 20th floor was garbage and cell data no good. Moving walkways between the Luxor and Excalibur were broken. Food bottled water and drinks were very expensive for a Casino but was able to find cheaper water and drinks at nearby store.
40,The hotel was clean staff was nice room was clean. The A/C did not work very well and the fan in the bathroom didn't work and bussed loudly. Problems were reported but not fixed. We would stay againbut would be sure to sit in room for a little bit before unpacking to see if it would cool down.
40,ive stayed here thre last 10-15 years always a hit or miss with the quality of the rooms  this time i had a west tower room 17th floor was a very nice clean room good view my daughter stayed in a renovated pyramyd room her room looked great the shower in her room was a problem it got the floor pretty wet. the service peoplre are aleways nice the food was good where we ate was good public house the cafe and the deli the had was good too
10,I will never stay at this hotel EVER!!! We had to switch 3 rooms. The first room had dirty floors. The second room had socks a receipt and a whole blunt in the room. I was so shocked had to take a video of it to show the front desk. They changed us to another room and that was nasty too. They gave us another room and we ended up leaving the next day. Worst experience EVER in Vegas!
20,We stayed here for our wedding. We had three other parties that came. We requested that we all be put on the same floor. They said it would be handled. We were all on different floors and couldn't get to each other's room because of the security feature on the keys
40,No issues except for long elevator walk. I stayed at one of the Rooms that were recently renovated and felt quite bige. The only real issues we had where random ding don ditches at 4am in the morning where they would knock hella loud on the door and run. Rooms were cleaned everyday though.
50,We had a great stay at the Luxor for 5 nights! At check in they have us a free upgrade and got a great room for us with great air conditioning! Everyone was super helpful and always saw staff cleaning 24/7! Which made everyone fell comfortable. Will be back for sure!!
40,After our last stay in Vegas the wife & I decided that we wanted to stay on the south end of the strip on the next visit for a change of pace. While planning this trip we chose the Luxor. We booked it a few months in advance of our travel dates. After booking and it was getting closer I started looking at the reviews for the Luxor....probably just getting excited about the trip. Holy smokes the reviews were all over the place....but seemed to be mostly negative. We were somewhat apprehensive and started to question our decision to stay at the Luxor. After several days of thinking about it we decided to keep the reservations and stay at the Luxor.    I am not sure what all the complaining was about. Checking in was a breeze. We chose to use the registration desk and not the mobile check in app. The line was not very long at all and they moved people through fairly quickly. Their were some patrons that slowed the process but that is going to happen anyplace. We got our room and it was clean and orderly. The air conditioner was not working very well but we gave it the night. The next day we went back to the desk and got our room switched without any issues at all. The person we spoke to (failed to get her name) was super friendly and helpful. The new room was clean and comfortable.    We probably will never stay on the south end again....just prefer more north....but we wouldn't have any worries about booking at the Luxor again.
40,My favorite since 1994! but needs a updated refresh in inclinators & rooms. Great casino floor & nice bar staff walking around asking you for drinks. Been to Vegas 11 times & stayed in Luxor 6 of those times.
20,I stayed here for four nights completely free with my Mlife offers. I had never stayed here before so I wanted to experience it...plus I didn't want to spend a lot of money on this vacation. I don't regret staying here because it just solidified my opinion on other resorts being better. There wasn't anything horrifying about my stay but compared to other options this was at the bottom. It's so far away from the heart of the strip I feel Iike I didn't do much of what I originally planned - which is my own fault. It's just not an ideal location in my eyes. The room was subpar our view was nonexistent since there was the advertisement on our window the AC didn't seem to work at all and the room was consistently hot. The beds are extremely firm which actually worked out for me since I have a bad back but it didn't feel like a hotel for some reason. Overall it was fine. It was an experience. If something was horrible I would have contacted the staff. That wasn't the case. I just had really high expectations and realized you get what you don't pay for. Also --- the inclinators?? Can those get serviced soon? They're literally begging for it.
30,Staff was accommodating of multiple room issues but the experience was tainted due to AC door lock and noisy maintenance overhead. Overall room was clean. Great housekeeping and the food court better than those of other resorts we visited. This was a late honeymoon and vacation.
10,The hotel is so run down I was embarrassed and had to apologize to our group multiple times. I’m mot overly dramatic so take my comments at face value. I’ve stayed at a range of hotels from very value focused to nice in business travel. This wasn’t even in the middle. Don’t stay here unless you don’t mind feeling like you are staying in the 1970s with lack of any effort on renovation.
50,At this hotel you are between 2 other connected hotels. Everything is right there. There is absolutely no need to leave the hotel. View and Pool is beautiful and Customer service is awesome. Love this Hotel. I hope my next visit the Business Center is open. I appeared to be very nice.
10,I will never ever stay there again. The room was beyond dirty with water marks on all the tables . That was by far something I have never seen in my life . The tables and chairs seem like they were from when the hotel opened in the 1990’s
40,Another great stay. Great location while attending BYU vs Arizona football at the new stadium. Easy walk from casino to stadium. Great value compared to other area casinos for the dates we stayed. Perfect place to stay if going to a Raiders game or any other event at Allegiant Stadium. Go Raiders!
30,My room was remodeled and was nice but you could still see some wear and tear. But for the price it was fine. The mobile check in was fantastic and super convenient. Overall it was a good stay. The enchiladas at diablos cantina are great.
20,The staff was very friendly we all enjoyed the Public House restaurant and Blue Man Group is a must see!!! We enjoyed spending time at the pool. However the waterfalls were not in working order and at times you could smell a sulfuric odor around parts of the pool deck. The rooms in the pyramid were clean but very outdated. We stay at this location because the kids wanted to stay in the “pyramid.” We will not be staying at this property in the future.
20,The first room smelled of cigarettes. I did contact guest services and was moved to another room. Immediately upon entering you could hear some type of drilling. I asked a staff member in the hallway and was informed that work was being done. In addition the room was super warm  to hot as it was 105 or more that day. The staff member explained she believed they was some construction and that they were working on the AC unit as there had been issues. My thought was am I being punished for my complaint about the cigarette smoke. But being asthmatic didn’t think it was good to remain my entire stay. The second room was so warm the AC only cooled late night. It’s truly unfortunate.  The shower no matter how I moved the shower head the floor was wet to the point I nearly fell. After that I placed a bath towel on the floor. I understand now the reason both hotel rooms bathroom door had water damage. The staff were very friendly but that doesn’t change my overall view. I can’t say I would recommend the hotel to friends or family.
30,"My last stay there was a bad experience the room I booked in advance was given to someone else. I didn't find that out till after I checked in with the front desk and was given key cards for my room on the 20th floor...after finally going across the whole hotel and waiting for the busy elevators we finally got up there and I opened the door and there was a person on the bed taking a nap and there belongings were everywhere and it smelled like weed so I proceeded to call the front desk and tell them the situation and was told to wait for security outside ""my supposed room"" instead of just getting a new room assigned. So I waited 20 minutes and no security showed up so i flagged down a housekeeper lady. She didn't speak English very well so she gave me her phone after calling a supervisor who then informed me that that room is not mine and I would have to go all the way back down to the front desk. Needless to say I was furious since check-in was at 3pm and it was now past 4pm and I have been carrying my luggage around the whole hotel 2 times now...I eventually got to a front desk person who apologized and assigned me a different room on a lower floor. It was apparently just renovated. So I finally got to my new room and noticed the air conditioner was old and barely working and the stupid shower design has half of a glass door and no safety bar. Water got all over that bathroom because there's nothing to stop the water from leaving the shower needless to say it was a hazard no joke. I even had to call housekeeping to bring up extra towels just to soak up the water. Overall it was not a good Experience and the only reason I stayed was because it was labor day weekend and everything else was booked."
20,Room 1215 in the West Tower reeked of sewer when we first arrived & the next morning. The AC didn't feel like it was on all night even at its lowest setting. Pillows & bed were comfortable to say the least. Water pressure & water heating were very good as well. The tub was still dirty upon arrival.
20,I had booked an elite suite in their pyramid. Without notice they changed my room to a one bedroom suite in the east tower. When I tried to question why it was changed they had tried to convince me that I was wrong. It took my showing them my confirmation email just to prove that I was not making things up. I understand it was a busy weekend and I'm usually easy going but essentially saying I'm lying doesn't help the situation.
30,I don’t know if Covid has done this to all hotels but disappointed with my lack of guest service/good customer service . Hard to find staff to help. No one answers calls from the room phone - sat on hold 15 mins. Boyfriend went to front desk to ask for assistance for our tv not working for three nights and they wouldn’t put in a request saying his name wasn’t on the room yet I had already added his name to the room and showed on my Mgm app. So then I had to find the time to go the desk and get told they can’t do anything about it . Then the next evening after house keeping its suddenly fixed . Also the casino had some slots no longer there . Some areas of the hotel had a horrid smell.  It was just sad  that place was my home away from home but now I don’t plan to stay there next year.
40,only down fall is it 2as hard to find places to eat. the strip restaurants were mostly closed and restaurants in the casino were closed. I was not happy with traveling to get food. Parking was also a mess with the event they had on a holiday weekend 😐
30,Bedroom safe was unable to open call down over four different times to get the safe open. No fridge in the room unable to store away water and drinks. Would love to see a microwave in each room. Was in Vegas for our wedding and no special treatment was given. The WiFi was not strong.
50,We stayed at the Luxor because it was within walking distance to the Raiders stadium. The walk wasn’t bad at all and the rooms were super nice and clean and didn’t have any smoke smell. There was also a Starbucks in the lobby which helped start the day in a great way!
30,Usually when I stay here it is pretty good. Rooms are clean the stay is cheap the gambling is cheap and the location isnt terrible. The first room we checked into smelled extremely moldy and the entire carpet floor was completely flooded and marinating in the carpet. We moved rooms immediately and found out the new rooms AC did not function. So our room was hot the entire weekend. We had to sleep one night with the door open because the hallway was colder. I called maintenance 3 times and and they never came after waiting 2 hours plus on all occasions. Thankfully on the last night I went to the front desk and Elaine comped 2/3 nights. The AC was never fixed and we slept in a musty room every night.
30,Hotel need improvements badly. The pyramid corner rooms are dark dirty and claustrophobic. The towers rooms need to be updated aswell. If you books thru MGM app you get really bad rooms facing wall or parking lot.
40,Spent Labor Day weekend with friends at the Luxor for my best friends birthday. Nice room few amenities though . Easy access to pool and casino. Phone was stolen in the bar and security said they couldn’t help and wouldn’t look at cameras. Never found phone.
10,Bed was comfortable but shower is horrible. Only glass on one side so water gets everywhere.make sure to leave enough time to get to where you need to we often had to wait for an elevator sometimes for 15 minutes. It was awful. It would be worth the extra money to stay on the strip closer to everything
10,Shower water spilled everywhere on the floor some outlets didn’t work and room lock did not work. I wasn’t expecting a luxury room because that’s not what I paid for but at least to have standard room appliances ti work!
50,I really enjoyed my stay for the labour day weekend. Even if it was busy it was a well and clean hotel ! Check in was a bit long but staff were great on getting the time for check in /out in quiet a decent time ‘  Until next time Luxor !!😀
30,The only thing that really made it not so great were the check in people that one tall bald man in the check in area he worked 09/05/21 between a times 11-1 is the time we went to ask questions he needs to be taught to treat costumers better
10,Mattress are super hard! I’ve had better sleep at lower end motels than here I would understand if it was a basic room but it was a SUITE.  Asked for a non smoking room and our room stunk like cigarettes and marijuana. Called front desk and they just made a “Note” didn’t offer to move us into another room.
50,The updated room was a pleasant surprised. The shower had a half door and no matter how you positioned the shower head water was splashing everywhere. The bathroom floor was very wet and even had some puddles. Had to use a lot of towels to soak it up.
30,The rooms are dated but they were clean. The first night I got in the carpet in front of the bathroom was wet I assumed it was from the previous cleaning but also noticed the shower was a wheelchair accessible shower and wondered if the water came out of the shower. Well I found out the next morning that the shower floods the bathroom floor. I was able to get towels down before it went out to the room. They moved me to another room in the tower at no additional charge. The only thing about the tower is that it is too far out of the way when you have other friends staying at the hotel.
50,The hotel was clean and staff was friendly. The pool was beautiful. The hotel was quite a distance from the busier part of the strip. It's quiet. The waitresses don't come around often at the slots. Easy checkin.
50,Great suit  the bathrooms and tubs could definitely be cleaner. I paid for the suit with tub for my girls birthday. And it was a little dirty to be honest  other than that the elevators could be cleaner as well
10,The hotel needs to be torn down. It’s really run down dusty (it’s funny they have signs saying excuse their dust while they renovate it see nothing being done). Go anywhere else…literally anywhere! Resort fees are a joke for this place!
50,Great hotel and casino. Good comps using casino card. Since we fo all the time we had free suites and food credits as well as free play. Highly recommend. We stayed in a 2 room suite and it overlooked the strip.
40,Great area for entertainment. Room very roomy but no microwave or refrigerator. Beds sleed pretty good but a bit hard. Shower pressure and temperature is amazing however they don't have a closing door which gets the floor really wet.
40,My stay was nice. The room and the hotel were clean and comfortable. Amenities are becoming fewer as the rates and fees go up. Vegas is not 24 hours anymore. At midnight we found one restaurant open. Being forced to pay for parking when I shouldn’t have was a sour way to end my stay at Luxor.
10,Just stay away. thats all i have to say. Clogged drains broken curtains smelly room bad customer service far walk to room. horrible casino. seems as if nobody i even working there. nobody cares to help. stay away its disgusting
50,Compared to other hotels the Luxor has a decent room. Its clean and very comfortable. Matches everything. You get a good view outside the windows. I will always book at the luxor from now on. It was a great experience!
50,We enjoy going to Vegas but don’t like the hustle and bustle of the middle of the strip. Luxor was perfect! You could still get to everything but also be away from the super crowdedness of the strip. The casino was amazing! Staff was so nice all around! Very clean and a great room! We will for sure stay again!
30,Went 24 hours without hot water. Someone entered room at 8:30 am while we were sleeping and woke us up scaring us. Shower needs to be re-designed. No shower curtain only glass wall that covered only half the tub. Which allowed water to flood the floor when showering.
10,Luxor is probably the worst hotel I've stayed at on the strip of Las Vegas. The rooms are thrown together. The best thing about this hotel is the room service. They make sure your room is at least descent.
10,"""Wellness"" rooms do not have any 2021 standard accommodations. No USB ports the outlets are loose so standard charging cubes fall out. There is 0.0 different about a wellness room. There is a tube on the shower faucet and a machine in the room.. there is not any scent or sound as you may expect. I also booked 2 standard king rooms- same plug issue. None of the 3 rooms have a coffee maker or fridge. Not uncommon to see trash on floors piled by trash cans in the restroom or even trash in front of the main entry way."
20,We went as a party of six to the Luxor for my 8-year anniversary. We received a room that was not renovated and the tower rooms that my friends got were disgustingly dirty. You have to be able to use Wi-Fi to get into your rooms and unfortunately the Wi-Fi there is absolutely horrendous. Half the time we were unable to even get up in the elevator due to you needing a key but the key is on your phone and again the Wi-Fi is so bad you're unable to use it. Next time I go back to Vegas I don't think I will be staying in the Luxor. The theme of the outside was awesome but once you step into the rooms the whole theming disappears. The signage unfortunately does not help you get anywhere and you get lost very easily in this giant maze of a hotel.
40,I plan on going back to Vegas pretty soon and thinking about staying at Luxor again. I will also recommend this hotel to friends and family. I will look to see what kind of deals are available in the near future. Thank you.
30,Fun place to gamble but the suite needs updating and the cleaning staff needs to do a more detailed cleaning. Rooms also need to be updated. Furniture is very outdated. Gambling is pretty good at the tables. The dealers were very nice and friendly.
10,"The ""recently"" renovated rooms were not very recently renovated. The room reeked of smoke. You feel every spring in the beds. The sound proofing is woeful. I was charged double the amount quoted on my reservation. The staff throughout the Casino is hypocritical about the mask mandate. One minute they aren't wearing masks the next they're telling you to wear yours. Even though people can smoke all day long with no mask. Typical Nevada hypocrisy. The parking garage is disgusting. And not secure at all. The buffet was disappointing. I could go on forever. I never write reviews like this. But this was just so unacceptable I couldn't believe it. This was probably my last stay with any MGM property"
10,My family and I got there tried checking in at our designated check in time with early check in. They denied us our room and made us wait outside for 5-6 hrs. Stay away from this hotel at all cost. Terrible
10,We found one of the two rooms smelling like cigarette it took the staff more than 2 hours to clean but they were not able to fully get rid of the smell. In addition we took an UV light and we saw lots of nasty stains in the carpet and in the bed. One of the rooms was dirty (we had two). Also important to notice that their $30 Food and beverage credit is not worth the money they do not honor the list the give you for participating establishments and they wont give you a definite list of which will will work and which wont work. As an apology they gave me a $25 food and beverage certificate but I was not able to use it anywhere nor they were willing to discount it from the multiple food and beverage charges I had to our rooms.
50,Peaceful stay Staff was very nice lost and found was accurate. The rooms were very clean gambling service was good  All the restaurants in the casino or very goodParking was easy and fast and most hotels took the parking pass and room key
20,"The Luxor is the 2nd largest hotel in Vegas expect long lines! Check in is a long wait. Our room was a ""stay well"" room supposed to have air purifiers and smell good. It smelt like cigarettes and weed and I mean very strongly like it had just been smoked in! Disgusting to try and stay in that room the casino floor actually smelt better! We got switched to the East tower but previously we were at floor 25 in the pyramid and were downgraded to the 6th floor but at least the room was clean and fresh. Expect everything to be a long wait as the hotel is super busy! Starbucks was a 28min wait to get our order of a simple iced coffee and sandwich. The other thing that took long was parking on a busy night. We spent 30min on the street trying to park. We finally got to the entrance of the self parking where we had already previously parked before to find out that it was closed and had to go all the way back out into gridlock traffic to get to the other entrance of the parking because they filled up the garage and as hotel guest who paid for parking I was told I had to go to the other side to find upper level parking and spend more time in traffic. They raise the price to parking for stadium events nearby and capitalize on making $$ rather than prioritizing their hotel guests whom already paid for parking! How classy NOT! I will never pay to stay at the Luxor again and I will be letting my friends and family know to pick another hotel if they go to Las Vegas."
50,plenty of things to do clean enjoyable atmosphere friendly staff . no problems restaurants the food excellent service was top notch/ front desk personnel did the best they could with the crowds they kept their calm demeanor
50,The staff was very friendly and it is in the center of the downtown. You can go places with walking distances. It is very family friendly. The pool was huge with five pool combined. We all had fun. The buffet was really good and cafe prices was excellent. I would strongly recommend.
10,Rooms are aged dirty and poorly maintained. Limiting dining options after midnight. Constant odor of marijuana in common areas pool and room hallways. I waited on hold for 45 minutes to reach the front desk and when they finally answered my problem wasn’t resolved. Will not stay here again.
30,Used to hit the older strip hotels for decent up and down play Luxor high limit used to an absolute blast. Not any more during/after pandemic - they have clamped everything down to really squeeze you. I don’t mind losing if it’s up and down but down down down and no fun upward is not for me.
30,The hotel is old but the rooms are really nice! Comfortable beds and nice room darkening curtains. The location was awesome to get to a game at Allegiant stadium! Super quick walk loved it! Walking distance to the rest of the strip (Vegas walking distance… so you know…) the lines were always SO long at the front desk so I would suggest doing the app check in! But still frustrating that it was impossible to talk to people. The showers were also dumb only half the shower had glass so the floor was always covered with water after a shower pretty annoying haha. Overall decent! We went over a holiday weekend so it was way more expensive that it was worth on any other weekend.
50,My wife and I have been going to Las Vegas for many years. We’ve stayed at different hotels but the Luxor keeps calling us back. The food is great and the comps we get from our Executive Host make our stay there very special.
50,I've been to many other casino hotels in Vegas over the years (Bellagio Venetian Planet Hollywood Caesar's etc....) which are more highly regarded than the Luxor. However the customer service experience I received at Luxor was exceptional and overall it was a very pleasant stay. I will return to Luxor!
30,Casino was very generous to me it’s nice and have a hippie vibe in social areas.. however my room wasn’t as clean. Dust and dirt was on table and lamps.. the beds were clean air worked great in the room I had. The elevators were terrible during checkout time. People literally waited 30 minutes plus for an available elevator.. and the stairs were blocked on some floors. Other than that my stay there was ok I guess
50,Had an amazing experience i will definitely recommend the Luxor friends and family. The elevators were not working very well the first day. But the next day it was fixed. I will definitely stay here any time.
20,The room I was given was not clean the bed had crumbs and the shower had purple gunk on the walls and I would have had to wait at least an hour to get another room so I had to buy wipes and wiped down the room myself
50,I had a great time lots of fun and drinks good party atmosphere and quiet rooms to get away from the noise if you need. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The food was very good as well and the wait times were not very long
20,Plain room with nothing special. Dirty toilet when we first entered room. TV never worked sheets didn't fit the mattress and worst of all housekeeping entered room at 9am while we were still asleep. Totally unacceptable.
20,The Luxor is full of hits and misses which made for an interesting time in Vegas. This resort will construction in the early ‘90s and is definitely showing its 30-year age. First check-in is a complete nightmare. The lines are insanely long and they have 1-2 people trying to check all these people in. Be prepared to spend at least an hour in line at check-in. We stayed in a pyramid suite room. The room is spacious and the bed is very comfortable. The room is very dated. The wood furniture shows numerous areas of wear from the years of use. The carpets have bumps where they are separating from the underneath. Wallpaper is peeling in several places and there is defined water damage along the walls in the bathroom. The rooms are in massive need of updating. There is no room service and there is no coffee maker in the rooms. Also cell phone service does not work well inside the building. One of the workers there even verified this with us. The gaming area is your standard Vegas gaming area. There is nothing special about it. Now with all that said they have a couple of really neat exhibits and the theming of the hotel is really neat. For that I have given them the two stars. I would briefly visit the hotel in the future but I would not stay here.
20,Digital key on phone stopped working in elevator and room. Had to talk to a front desk about it who suggested we wait in line to speak with someone and the line was very long so I asked the front desk if she can help cause all I need are room keys and she directed me to the iPad where we can print out room keys. Tub was dirty and had green/brown areas which was so disgusting.
40,Internet was crappy the whole time but overall house keepers were friendly and helpful and our room was pretty clean beside the one day we had ice cold water. I disliked that the food court close so early because after drinking or being down at the casino people get hungry and something should still be open!! Also for drinks to be free while gambling the waiters don’t come around much. I didn’t receive not one free drink eventually I went to the bar to purchase my own but I still loved the environment
30,It was an okay stay. Staff was helpful and friendly. Wifi was super slow. The TV remote was not working and it turned out to be that it needed new batteries. The pool was amazing and I didn’t want to get out because the water felt so good and the ambiance was good too.
20,We had issues from the moment we stepped onto the property. Not worth what we paid. Save your money and stay somewhere else. Overall the only way to describe this hotel was Ghetto. The room was HOT AC barley worked.
20,I feel terrible for posting this however I experienced and understaffed and over worked group of employees at the Luxor. It clearly showed! You need to double all of your information especially when it comes to comps valet parking and my rewards. MGM as a whole needs to understand…take care of your employees so they can take care of the customer.
30,Could use some renovations but only giving my constructive criticism on the rooms only. With superb rooms this place could be a 5 star hotel. Its unfortunate that they still have the 80's popcorn ceilings the broken furniture the stains on walls etc.
50,Great place to visit Las Vegas with your whole family. Amazing facilities great pools friendly staff clean and new game machines inside casino area. Guests rooms are very clean good smelling and very spacious. Our room had a wonderful view and that was a plus for enjoying our stay. Very very recommended.
40,Great experience again.....cabana was awesome suite was clean and always enjoy the overall low key feel here. We have stayed here at least 12-13 times and it keeps getting better. The only downfall is our bartender at the sports book on the last day must have woke up on the wrong side of the bed.....she was super crabby. We moved on to another bar and things went great as always.
50,Remodeled rooms fun table people and restaurants were good. Ill be back. Checkin was easy with online checkin  never had to wait in long lines and access to my room with my phone was great. People running the tables were fun and made losing money less painful.
30,Good but When I check out they didn’t return the 50 dollars deposit & they didn’t add my parking into my card and I have to pay ones take to long to check in and when I tried to fix my problem with the parking I made 35 minutes line to fix it
20,Worst experience with hotel room.    Room Reservations was Pyramid Premier Two Queen. We upgraded our room Tower One Bedroom Suite bigger more amities we pay extra $75 plus resort fee $35 per night the room was really bad flooring a lot damaged scratches all over the floor walls and dark spot dirty. needed major repair the flooring fealty and dusty all over the room. I took some pictures for future used in case they charge us. The most important they don’t have no exhaust fan in the toilet 🚽  the refrigerator in the room like a freezer beer frozen”    we lost one of our luggage we I bell desk forgot by chair. Hopefully they wave all the fees we pay we appreciate if they considerate.    The casino manager and dealer they’re very nice and friendly we differently going back there to  play again.
10,Was given a key card to my room for the night only to find out it's someone else's room. ended up finding out it was 2 young girls . When I explained the situation to the manager they tried shutting me up with a free one night stay. The girls where scared obviously.. was a terrible situation they put us in. Never going back !
20,Where do I even start? From the time that I arrived to the time that I left. When I first arrived I had no clue where self parking was because of an event at the stadium. I asked someone that I thought worked with the hotel or at least knew the area being that they lived in the city/state. The response that I received was “uhhh isn’t it here behind the hotel?”. After that response I tried to just stay positive. Then when I checked into my FIRST room…there were toothbrushes on the floor and utensils that were used. We’re dealing with a pandemic and that is completely unsanitary. I called and spoke with a young lady that was so nice and switched my room. Then the second room it was absolutely hot I thought it just needed time to cool off but no. I called the front desk 3 times. The man I spoke with the first 2 times was absolutely rude and then the 3rd person I spoke with told me a manger couldn’t come to the phone because they were with a guest and that I would have to come downstairs to talk to someone. When I get downstairs…I see more than 1 manager on the floor. So I instantly become irritated and finally spoke to Robert and Carmella which were the only helpful people. They ended up providing a comp and then switching my room AGAIN. When I got back up the room the maintenance man came and told me that I have to remember that the hotel is a huge black glass building and there are too many rooms. I shouldn’t be told that I have to remember anything about a structure and layout of a building that I didn’t help build or create. Once we moved rooms the room was still hot and only got cold when it was night time. I had always wanted to stay in the Luxor because I heard everything about the place was amazing but I will never go back ever again and will never recommend a stay to anyone. Even the EMPLOYEES that we spoke with said the hotel is a piece of crap. I honestly wish I could’ve gotten a refund for all of the BS that happened but by gones will be by gones and I will never step foot in that place ever again.
20,Nothing more to say besides they need to attend to the rooms more and the supervisor should be spot checking the rooms. It should never be a time where dirt  Is on the bed and in clear site and no one see it.
30,The room fell in the Motel 6 category. The ceilings needed major repair. The windows and filter to the air conditioner were filthy. The bathroom door was rotten at the bottom due to water hitting it when the shower is being used. Also no refrigerator in the room.
40,Overall Hotel was good. Would be nice to have a coffee pot and refrigerator in the room. It was really good to have a specific Uber spot. Food was good and we had no issues with the staff. Overall good stay
10,We were staying in the elite two bedroom tower suite. We did not have hot water for 3 days front desk was not helpful at all and we had numerous issues with getting someone to fix this issue. Never again.
40,Close to the airportCan’t beat it as far as proximity goes on the strip and to the airport area it is the most convenient site and property to be at definitely coming back and will be staying there again on my next trip in December
50,My girlfriend (26F) and I (26M) stayed at the Luxor for 3 days at the end of August. Outside was HOT. Inside the Luxor was great. Got to see the inclinators went to the pool the bed was great.    I will say that it sucks to be so far away from mid-strip. We like to play poker and the nearest reasonable games were annoyingly far away. Would stay at Luxor again but might budget more for Ubers.
20,The entire casino was a great vibe from the variety of games music played attractions and people in general but the room we stayed in completely missed the mark. Our refrigerator was missing the water in the shower (that is clearly marked hot and cold) was opposite of signage no bathtub or shower door and the shower drain stopped working the last day causing the water to flood over onto the floor. They do give you complimentary masks and hand sanitizer in a little black reusable bag which we thought was nice but it smelled extremely overwhelming of marijuana. We would definitely come back but the standards for the rooms should be just as high as the overall casino.
50,We stayed at Luxor because 50 years ago we were honeymooning at The Hacienda which was in or near the same place. We were treated very well and were given a great room. We had a little trouble sleeping because of the music coming from a Beer Garden but otherwise it was perfect. I'm sure that those enjoying the Beer Garden slept just fine.
30,At least you will if you use the mobile key. It’s kind of cool that your room key is on your phone - there’s comfort in knowing that it’s going to be with you no matter what - but the key only takes you to your own floor. Which is great for security but lousy when the key app glitches or the reader in the particular elevator you’ve chosen doesn’t work. So you’re standing in this elevator that won’t go where you want it to with no service on your phone so your key won’t refresh going “now what?” When you find yourself in this situation - and you will guarantee it - just take a deep breath hit the button for the casino floor leave the elevator refresh the app and try again (in a different elevator because it’ll probably work better).    New technology. They’ll figure it out eventually but it’s still buggy at the moment.
40,Good hotel for the price and decent location along the strip. Friendly staff and rooms are very quiet and night. Family friendly and right next to Excalibur. Three Starbucks located on the property with good service.
20,We had a shower without a bath & you had to take 5 minute showers because the shower was clogged so it filled up with water &didn’t want it to pour out of the shower door the hair dryer was also broken
10,My last night at the hotel I was expecting to sleep so I could wake up early to get my flight the next day in the morning but they had some people working outside at the window after midnight and it was so loud the workers were talking and doing noises the entire time for about 4 hours. I was not expected and it was very disrespectful. I’m very disappointed.
50,We stayed at the Luxor from August 29th through September 3rd. We had a great experience. The staff was helpful. It was a little bit of a walk to other places along the strip but it was well worth it. The tram between the Excalibur and the Mandalay (with the Luxor in between) helped make the walk better. We would stay again! We also saw Carrot Top's show at the Luxor and it was well worth it. It was an anniversary trip we will always remember.
10,My room was robbed the first night of my stay. They took a report and moved me to an equivalent room on another floor and gave me a couple food and beverage tickets. I did not ask for any comps or upgrades but it did suck losing $1800+ worth of electronics and not feeling very safe and still having to pay when I checked out. I’m a single mom and was traveling alone with 2 children the rooms also don’t have microwaves or refrigerators or coffee makers - so combined with the safety issue I will never stay here again. Totally awful.
50,We had a great time. Everything was awesome. One tall white guy with a bald head at the centra bar was not friendly and did not serve us drinks at all but a young lady did and she was awesome. Food and experience is beyond awesome. We would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone. Thanks Luxor.
30,The checking lines are ridiculously long even at midnight. The lines to the elevators are ridiculous. The elevators will take you to every floor except for the one you would to go to. Our room was clean but those wall are thin!
20,The hotel needs a complete overhaul. Not worth the money. The bathroom had soap scum on the shower head. The tiles were cracked. No exhaust fan in the bathroom. The tile behind the bathtub was filthy.
50,Fun place.. nice pool friendly staff clean rooms. Pleasant smell in luxor pyramid..lots of new slot games..really good places to ear.fun pool party during my stay..overall luxor is a great place to stay
40,Clean safe and quiet during my stay. Small issues like a shower that waters the bathroom floor and long check in times (Mobile app did not allow for check in) prevented a perfect score. Rooms are clean and nice although not modern. I’d describe the hotel as good not great. The pool was nice but could use more shaded areas. The gaming floor had a large variety of table games and slots. Check out was significantly easier than check in. There appear to be 3-4 Starbucks locations in the building I only ever saw one of them open leading to long lines and a complete lack of space for the amount of people they were trying to serve.
50,Staying at the Luxor hotel was a pleasant experience. The Carrot Top show was fun and entertaining. The cocktail waitresses were friendly and always around for a drink. All the staff was helpful and friendly.
20,Stayed here 5 years ago. Convenient parking and great buffets. On this trip we had to self park at Excalibur which is about a 1/2 mile walk. This was not communicated to me in advance. No signage providing directions made for a very unpleasant arrival. Checked in online but our digital key didn’t work so had to find a kiosk and print key. Bathroom in our room smelled like cigarette smoke. Limited buffet hours.
40,Luxor is a Vegas Strip classic but shall not take this status as understood always improve. Signage on the floor was sometimes confusing. Plus no hotel without a coffee maker in the room is getting a perfect score from me. Small fridge also would add to the ambiance of the hotel famous for drinks everywhere.
10,Checked in looked at the beds checked the bathroom there were roaches on the walls. Took videos of the incident went downstairs they changed the room after waiting over 30 mins at the deskand I had the same issue. Room was dirty wasn't cleaned. I was too tired from my trip all I wanted was a clean room to sleep.
40,The bathroom sink have a swellage smell and there were some black particles coming up from the sink. It took about 5 mins for the water to drain every time we use the sink. There was also a used soap bar left the bathroom.
50,Lovely hotel besides the shower not having a door or no microwave in the room nor in the hotel but other that I would the hotel it was the last place my idol stay before he died rip Tupac Shukar Vegas and Luxor thank you for you wonderful experiences.
50,For the low cost of the room I was very surprised with the quality of the hotelcasinosvenuesand dinning options will definitely come back! Make sure to call and ask for a top floor for the great view from your room both inside and out!
50,My husband and I spent the day at Luxor playing Blackjack. Our outstanding dealer was Daniel Po. He was very helpful and friendly. He was the best dealer I have ever met in my 50 years of playing in Vegas. The table was $10 which is very hard to find. Daniel took his time making sure we were taken care of with drinks and hospitality. If your you playing at the casino tables find Daniel Po. You will enjoy a good time and might just win a little $$.    Donna and Jim  Arizona
30,Hotel room seems a bit small no coffee maker in room  no microwave or refrigerator  Bathroom sink dripsshower have powerful stream but lacks additional shower door so floors get really wet . The TV doesn't have Chanel guide so have to Channel surf .  The staff is OK but no room service and house keepers are few so we had to keep trash in room
50,Vegas get away.. lots of fun. Slots were not kind. Great selection of games. Staff was excellent. 24 hour restaurant was very slow on to go order. Took almost an hour for meal to be prepared. We went at 0300! Order was wrong but we took it because we were hungry. Food was good but expensive. Hostess was rude to other patrons. Did not eat there again.
50,Everything was great. Extremely comfortable and satisfied with my stay. Staff was friendly and helpful. Would definitely recommend to anyone who’s going to be in Las Vegas. Ms. Brenda at front desk was awesome and very helpful
30,Room was clean beds were comfy. We upgraded to be in the tower and the view wasn’t great. they could use some updating and better quality complimentary toiletries. Location is at the end of the strip the pool area was supposed to be the best and biggest (google ratings) and quite honestly it wasn’t all that (but was clean) Very overpriced for cabanas/umbrellas and food outside. Two daiquiris were $95 with tip (weak watered down strawberry taste) we didn’t even drink them. Also our TV wouldn’t work we had to call maintenance. They said an hour eta didn’t show until 1am.
50,The Luxor is very nice and clean. It’s located on the end of the strip but is in a good location to catch the tram and bus. You get a lot of bang for your buck. Our room was cleaned daily and we did big ha e any issues with the pool.
50,Great hotel Good experience I bookeda corner suite it was awesome had a bathtub right next to my bed. I also had a food court didn’t have to worry about food    housekeeping give me extra towels and gave me air freshener for the room
30,Happy to have the experience as this was my first time in Vegas but definitely won't be staying again. The room while clean for the most part was uncomfortable at best and obviously in need of some repairs. The dining options were lackluster and horrendously overpriced. Better options foodwise and in terms of price/quality were nearer Fremont street which ended up making every nasty meal I purchased in the hotel that much more upsetting. My next visit will definitely be either more centrally located on the strip or right on Fremont Street which is where we enjoyed the most. Shows/exhibits at the Luxor on the other hand are amazing and definitely worth the trip down this end of the strip. Had the room been more comfortable I would have raised value choice to 5/5 unfortunately with the look of the room once arriving I can certainly understand why the price is on the lower end.
20,Rooms and hallways not cleaned properly. Overall casino not being cleaned and sanitized like in other MGM properties. Cones on hotel room floor to mark cracked tiles that may be trip hazard. No priority given to VIP members.
50,The staff were friendly and the rooms were clean and nice! The only thing I would change is it was closer to the middle of the strip where we spent most of our day. But would definitely stay again!!!!
10,I was standing in a pool of my own bath water while trying to take a quick shower. Elevators are broken or not working. Spent more time waiting for an elevator or telling people to wait for the next one
50,Really enjoyed trip 😎 Vegas seemed to be coming back slowly? I will be glad when you’re buffet re-opens! Entertainment seemed limited? At this time! Gambling was still great 😊 check in was not time consuming! Appreciate that!
40,Older hotel check in hiccoughs but otherwise excellent service clean room comfy bed great shower. Food was excellent in the Pyramid Club didn't try the other food source (yes they have a Starbucks) as I only at breakfast there. I stayed in the Pyramid the elevators move at an angle feels weird but it's cool.
40,The Luxor staff were more than courteous. The only issue I had was the fact that I booked through what I thought was MGM Vacations but turned out to be a third party site that did not allow me to receive any MLIFE rewards upon check-in.
10,There is no value here! No fridge yet its 107°. They want you to buy everything at extremely high prices. Coffee not available in room and will take an hour to get at sbux. Showers built with no shower door and it sparys all over the room.
50,We enjoyed our stay! Staff was courteous. Housekeeping was great! The room was very nice. Air conditioning works very well!!  Can walk to many things for shopping and entertainment without going outside! The casino was even paying!!! I recommend it!!
50,Our annual summer trip was awesome again! Stayed at the Luxor again. Perfect location and it has everything you need right in the resort. The restaurants are very good and you are within walking distance to the excalibur restaurants also. The casino is very clean and safe for people worried about covid. The rooms are very nice and they are always clean. I will be back next July and possibly before that.
20,The room had toenails and the sink was backed up! The room also smelled of mold. 2 times the key card had to be reactivated at 2 am once and 4am the other time! No sorry or anything! Sad we really liked the lux!
30,Dirty room rude staff except for a few nice ones. Not a lot of dining options and watch out because everyone is trying to rip you off. The few places to eat either open late or close early and buffet wasn't open.
30,The rooms are dark and dank and DATED. Front desk staff fairly rude and slow as molasses which is evident when you see the length of the lines trying to check in from morning to night. Make sure you lock the deadbolt when you get in your room because they have a habit of double-assigning room numbers and someone WILL show up saying it's their room.
50,Excellent property service and gambling experience. Clean well maintained property. Pool is nice and I had the best rib eye steak at the Restaurant. Great location close to the MGm and other properties that I like to gamble at.
50,I've stayed at this resort multiple times and have not had a issue with anything thus far. Rooms are always clean. Staff is always friendly and helpful when needed. Its an added bonus that the Raiders are right next door and look forward to attending games in the future.
50,I was in town for a conference. The Luxor was a co-host hotel. Room rates were fantastic staff were very friendly and helpful. Restaurants had pretty reasonable prices. Pool area is nice. Rooms were spacious and nice.
30,This hotel I stay at quite a bit it’s a little outdated on the exterior of rooms but they are ok on the inside didn’t receive housekeeping like I wanted but otherwise a good hotel it is definitely better than some
30,The room was nice and clean but there was only limited slow 4G cell service in my room. The wifi was also very slow and not secured. I could get 5G cell service right outside the main entrance.The casino had the usual variety of tables and machines. I liked the fact that it is connected with the Mandalay via the Mandalay Shoppes walkway. The MGM app made it very easy to check in and check out via the app. They even email you when your room is ready. Really liked that!
50,The Luxor was a budget conscious choice made after researching hotels restaurants pictures etc and we could not be happier with our choice. The shops as well as easy access to other MGM casinos/shops/restaurants without having to go outside was wonderful with the heat. The pool experience was very relaxed and enjoyable
10,Becareful of leaving your belongings the security staff are very under educated on policies. They don't understand the difference between accidentally leaving something versus lost and found things. Even after my daughter followed of of the rules they tried to separate my gift card and license. Knowing I was an out of town guest. It makes you feel as if they were attempting to steal it for their own personal good. The staff was rude front desk bell agent with long braids very unprofessional she worked day shift on the 30th. Hotel pretty but HORRIBLE HOSPITALITY. I WOULD NEVER STAY AGAIN. Go to Mandalay Bay or MGM. THE LUXOR STAFF IS RUDE UNDER EDUCATED ON POLICIES AND NOT HELPFUL AT ALL.
50,It was an excellent stay the pool service was amazing and friendly. The staff was immediately on top of anything we needed. The room was always cleaned and stocked up with toiletries when needed. Friendly staff
50,Room was excellent. Clean and bed was very comfortable. I always enjoy the gym and staff. Also very clean. Ate at three of the restaurants. Food was very good and service was very good. Pool area was nice.
30,Sewage smell in both the room and the pool mixed with mold from the shower and an elevator system that was not explained in the info provided made for a large waste of time that could have been spent enjoying the trip instead of getting stuck in there elevators after an electronic check in.
10,When I checked in my room was still had trash in it from the previous guest. I spoke with someone about it and I was told that someone will take care of it but I had to throw it out myself. Then I spoke to someone at the hotel again when I checked out and was told that someone will be contacting me but no one did. Other than the initial problem the other 2 days I was there was ok.
20,Large group of friends (20+) stayed here. Some of us had our own rooms and some of us had Block Rates. About half of the group we were with had issues of various types. For myself the room smelled like Pot and we had a slow draining Sink and a non draining shower. They did send maintenance and they were able to unclog the drains after that the pot smell went away.    On Monday we used the tub in our room and it was backed up and the smell returned. Did not inform the desk since we were checking out the next day.    Some of our friends had similar issues sinks and showers not draining. One of them had his water shut off for twenty minutes.    Also someone pulled the fire alarm yet all that happened was our intercom blaring with no idea what was going on. Had to call the front desk to even find out.
30,We come here twice a year and I spend quite a bit a money to receive less comps free play and food credits than the people we come with who spend less than us but get more comps and free play which has led us to potentially try a different hotel next time
50,They no longer have refrigerator in the rooms. I'm not sure if they had microwave from my previous visit pre-pandemic. And they don't allow you to use your free play earn with online games combined with complimentary rooms (bummer).
40,Not as pleased as I would think being a iconic hotel casino. Rooms are very roomy but bathroom dirty and had broken slow sink drain. Shower head broken and water pressure was like a fire hose shooting at you. Was a very long walk to elevator snd our room was half way around the pyramid snd bring handicapped it was awful tiring.
10,Chaotic. Room keys don’t work I used the key to enter my room unpacked went down to get ice couldn’t get back in had to go downstairs wait an hour in line get new key cards walk half a mile to my room again and a few days later same thing happened only I had to spend 45 minutes in line no apologies by The front desk the hotel is dirty and had to ask for towels after my room is cleaned.Place smells like pot all down the hallway. This trash was in the hallways for two days!!!
50,Luxor is in a great neighborhood of casinos and never disappoints. The employees are welcoming at check in and very tentative at the pool. A lot of restaurants on property as well as neighboring MGM properties. Hands down fun place to stay and Vegas. We will be back!
20,"Started out with not having all of our linens (only one wash rag day 1 no hand towels day 2). Shower floods the floor. Housekeeping did not respect our ""Do Not Disturb"" sign. We were in the room together (not prepared to have a visitor) and after knocking we called out that we were fine they tried to enter after that. If a DND sign is out that should not happen. I believe this is a failure in training. Also had a glass with a crack clearly in it we could not use left it on the corner as a hint it was not replaced."
30,"I would NOT stay here again in the same room (non refurbished). I would only consider staying in one of the newer/refurbished rooms only. We stayed in the pyramid and was hoping it would be a cool and unique experience. The elevators in the pyramid are angled and sort of rattle and bang around because of it. You also will lose all wifi and data in those elevators.    Room was huge - had a living area and then the sleeping/jacuzzi tub area. The furniture and carpeting had seen better days. The walls had peeling wallpaper and random swatches where they were trying to repair/cover things up. Couch was sunken in pretty badly. The beds in our opinion were horribly hard and uncomfortable. Small lumpy pillows. Wifi in the room was really hit or miss - don't try to do any meaningful work here. Room was a little on the hot side not sure why.    What few lights were in the bathroom all went out on me when I tried to use the restroom. Had to go in the dark then head down to the front desk to ask for help. Maintenance came up quickly and left once the lights were fixed and turned back on. Great service here really.    One night an alarm sounded with strobe lights for what seemed like forever but was probably only 10-15 minutes. The alarm was plugged into all of the rooms with no way to shut it off. Said something about a ""minor incident"" and they would update us. It eventually shut off with the message saying that everything was okay.    On the final morning I went to shower and wash up. The room had no hot water. Tried running the water for a few minutes to see if it might take some time to warm up. It never did. I didn't take a shower in the cold water."
40,People In our group stayed In both towers and the pyramid. All rooms seem to be updated now. Tower bathrooms are older so would probably stay in the pyramid next time. Hotel was good value and comfortable bed. Check in app didn’t work so don’t count on it. Make sure you book the room in whoever is arriving first’s name. Pool cabana was expensive but nice. Service was slow at the pool. Overall nice trip and about what we expected for the price.
40,With a price you can't beat rooms were terrific and clean. Casino seemed well staffed and friendly. Its a big place be prepared to walk distances. Reasonably priced Pyramid Cafe has a decent breakfast and lunch menu.
50,It’s always a good vibe when I stay at Luxor! Great staff great service clean and safe atmosphere. I love it here and I’ll be back in a few weeks!!! I’ve stayed here the last 4 trips to Vegas and I will continue to do so!
30,The room was hot because the air conditioning sucks. The toilet didn’t work correctly. The shower got water everywhere every time. There is no refrigerator or microwave in the room. The bed isn’t the best but not the worst out there I guess.
10,Place is old and dirty. You can see the trash on the roof when standing at the Hallway. We were on the 15th floor. The room has no fridge. The shower has no door only half way glass and while taking a shower the water is piling up outside the shower. So by the time we finished showering its flooded in the bathroom. I will never stay at this hotel.
40,I stay at the Luxor every time I go to Vegas. It’s a great value staff is friendly and it’s not as ritzy as other places on the strip. The problem with my recent stay was that my room was in the pyramid. The pyramid is extremely outdated—the elevators are slow the walk from room to elevator is excessive and the rooms never cool to an appropriate temperature. I love the Luxor but if you choose to stay there make sure your room is in the tower.
20,"But the rooms need some work. Granted I stayed in the pyramid I usually stay in the towers and if by chance I stay at the luxor again I will make sure I stay in one of the towers. The luxor used to be nice""ish"" especially for the price. Now I would say it kind of Excalibur ish..... You know cheap and you get what you pay for."
50,As always our stay was great. My family and I were in town to celebrate my son’s 21st birthday. We had a great stay and everyone we encountered was awesome. Front desk agent Michelle deserves a special thank you. We arrived early and she was able to get us all into our rooms without waiting.
10,Don’t ship items to hotel hotel smells like smoke and very outdated. Shipped items to hotel and found out they don’t accept shipments from guests. Got the run around and after 3 days at the conference we did not have items for our booth. Poor community.
30,We stayed in one of the newer renovated rooms and for some reason half the shower door missing- So all the water from your shower falls on your floor and it makes for an extremely cold shower!! We went through 20-30 towels trying to clean up all the water- The bathroom door is water rotted out from the bottom and looks horrible. There are no amenities in the room- minibar/fridge- coffee pot- but the room was a good price and the staff was really friendly so if your looking for a place just to sleep while you gamble- the Luxor has some good rates-
40,Love staying at this property away from the middle of the strip but still close to the other MGM properties. Suites are nice and comfortable pool area is great wife loves the spa food choices are just ok though. Wish they would update the high limit room too
50,Whether playing slots or simply having a drink guest were friendly. Never had to wait long for a beer while gambling. Easy to find your way around the property whether looking to get something to eat finding a bathroom or just a place to sit down and socialize with friends
10,Room 1/4 mile from elevator.    The only and super nice Luxor Hotel employee we met was the cleaning lady we left her a nice tip.    Pool for which you pay a $35 resort fee: hours and attendance were so reduced as to be impossible to go to without a mile of walking in your bathing suit to find out they were full or not open!!!    The room was lovely and bare due to pandemic hygiene restrictions that is to be forgiven of course. However the sink was barely operable due to a drainage issue and the toilet had to be flushed twice at intervals to properly operate.    Did I mention the $15 self parking fee? Your only parking option.    This experience was not enjoyed using the MGM Luxor Hotel app at the prompt of the MGM booking system.    I own and operate a lodging facility I would go out of business with this system in a few weeks.    Best of luck in you travels!
30,"Even the ""Stay Well"" rooms felt and were run down old.  Furniture was old and beat-up. The restroom looked old and water drainage was slow the water in the shower stall will fill up while you shower. Also this very loud noise kept waking me up and disturbing."
10,Clean the rooms. Get the bugs out. If your customers call to comp0lain about bugs do something to make them happy. No one offered us anything to try to make up for the room having bugs in it. Disgusting.
10,Liars and scammers....hit my card for a penny then for 100.00...didn't give me my promotions or food vouchers so no thanks to staying at this place...I been wanting to stay here for a few years now but I'd rather stay with the bums on the street atleast they don't lie and more trusting
10,First off the lady at the from desk argued with me on what room i reserved lucky i had all the information saved on my phone. After asking to talk to management i got the correct room. Then after checking in the room was hot we adjusted the A/C and left the room to do our things. When we came back the room was cooler but humid we called the front desk and they said they would send some one to look at the A/C Next day same thing but we got a fan too lol. A/C still not fixed we were offered to change rooms on our last night. we will defenatley not stay here again!! PLUS the room has no refrigerator witch they charge you @% bucks a day if you want one and no microwave. On that the restroom was a mess cookies and snacks left on the floor from a previous guest!!!
30,We came down to see Santana play and the Luxor had a great rate. After staying here I know why the rate is so good... the place is very dated probably has not been updated since new and it shows. There's plenty of wear and tear visible throughout the walkways and public areas (aside from the lobby which is beautiful) the ventilation is marginal and so your eyes will tear up unless you're a smoker too. That said the staff was great whenever we interacted with them so you should have a good experience with them. Also the noise from the public areas does leak into the rooms. Overall you get what you pay for and that held true here.
40,Beds felt like it wasn’t clean properly. Shower water was getting onto floor and door may cause water damage. Not much selection on channels… other than that. Great location to stay. Very convenient for food.
50,We stayed in the west tower with a beautiful view of the pool. The room was clean and had a great price point for amenities included. I love the location and how you can travel between a few MLife properties without ever going outside.
10,This use to be one of my favorites. Luxor staff is rude the room stay dusty and dirty. The carpets haven't seen a vacuum in years. Just look in the corners behind the curtains and side if bed. Charging security deposit now & per day parking. Beds are about as hard as ricks. Felt like you were sleeping on the concrete outside.
50,Exemplary service with a smile behind the mask. Phenomenal food at the restaurants. Bell hop service impeccable. Need more staff at the front desk and more valet assistance. This hotel can become busy.
10,Checked into a one bedroom “suite” and was underwhelmed. Right when we walked in there was visible water damage to the ceilings. Everything was old and smelled weird. Nothing was dusted. Switched to another room and it literally has stale fries and crumbs all over the floor. The hotels housekeeping manager was outside the doors and agreed they were not cleaned properly. I said we would stick to the suite if they can come clean it and provide the coffee pot that was supposed to be in there and wasn’t. We left and came back 4 hours later and the room still wasn’t touched. We pulled back the covers to find hair. That was the last straw. We called and said we wanted to cancel everything. We went to Mandalay Bay and it was so much better. Also Luxor wasn’t willing to do anything for us but give us a voucher for food and drink there that you couldn’t even use at all the restaurants at the hotel. The front desk manager seemed annoyed at me when I provided video of the nasty rooms
40,Clean quite enjoyed my stay.  Hot water was good for showering.  Shops in general seemed to close around 8-9pm. Service in restaurants were a bit of of wait but not out of the usual. It was hot and the mask mandate made it where you can get dehydrated easily.
40,This is my second time staying at the Luxor first time was 18 years ago you can tell us the building is getting older need some work but the staff is friendly polite every professional can’t complain about the service there for me personally what was weird is it 18 years ago I stayed there the first time this time with a very similar experience they put me in the same floor in the same room The door for the room with sticky back then it’s still sticky now on the mirror in the bathroom there’s a message this is watch it was there then it’s still there now it’s just like whoa brought back some good memories from the past
20,This is a really poor property. Entire hotel is outdated and not clean. No coffee or fridge in room is something I’ve not seen in years anywhere. The staff is trying here but overwhelmed Won’t stay here again if given a choice. Entire place smells like a really old ashtray.
40,The hotel was great clean and very spacious overall staff was very friendly and welcoming. The only reason we have any complaints is because the staff at the flight bar were not friendly and often somewhat rude but other than that service was great.
10,I just left my 3-month-old puppy at the hotel. Then go to arrange a marriage proposal. The guests complained about the noise. He was then forced to lock his room and asked to be forced out of the hotel in the early hours of the middle night There is no human service at all.  Also the staff is unprofessional and basic drinking water is not provided .
40,Very affordable and pretty nice inside and near the airport. Comfortable beds room was pretty quiet air conditioned (took a little while but once it was on it wasn’t bad) but the shower was a little stained. No mini fridge tried to call the concierge but they never answered 😭  Shows on site connected to other casinos 30 min walk to the next hotels and shops. Places to eat inside but they close early if you’re looking for late night snacks.  Over all I would stay again :)
50,If you decide to stay here stay in the East Tower Rooms. Luxor is a great place to stay. Buffet opens Sept 1 2021 and it was great back in 2019. Pyramid Cafe is also great too. Housekeeping is great. They came 3 times to my room to make sure if I needed cleaning or not. Great place to stay overall. WiFi did not work for me but it’s still great.
50,Staying at Luxor provided me the relaxation I needed for myself and husband. We enjoyed the atmosphere and the staff was very helpful and friendly. I would recommend this hotel to my family and friends. Not only that what you get for the price is immeasurable.
50,Staff was very helpful at the hotel and were able to guide in the best ways to get around town and what shows were playing where. Also with covid being a thing they explained the dos and don't of what was excepted from guests
50,Nice rooms and free drinks breakfast at the buffet was good. Close to everything right at the start of the strip…a little confusing to walk around tho. Overall great place to stay and apparently are kid friendly
50,We stayed at the Luxor for the GNR concert. The check in process was AMAZING did it all from my phone. Didn’t even need a room key!! Our experience at the Luxor was definitely enjoyable and will definitely be back! The elevators are super fast and you never have to wait on one. The dealers are friendly and play with you. The location is great especially if going to the new stadium it’s just right over the bridge! I highly enjoyed our room hands down one of the best resorts on the strip!
40,Please assign a security officer to hallways of the rooms to stop people from producing disturbances. Thank you. However our stay was pleasant. Enjoyed the casino the restaurants and gift shopped. Thank you.
10,Pay couple bucks more and stay at a better resort. This place you will smell weed all over. Dirty floor and casino old and dark room. Will never go back and wouldn’t recommend to anyone else. This place is joke.
50,Had an awesome visitLuxor has ample parkingis close to many amenitiestook my sons to see the Micheal Jackson One show next door at Mandalay Bayshort walk to get to the showworked out absolutely perfectcouldn’t be happier with the staff everyone was friendly and seemed to be genuinely happy to help.
40,The glut of available rooms throughout Vegas especially during the pandemic has forced many hotels like this one to severely slash their rates. Sure they all add their bogus resort fees but in the end the price is still pretty damn low. (I've paid more for a 70's style outside entrance motel in rural N.C. It's all about competition baby) Anyway the Luxor and other strip hotels are even offering free parking.  All this is good and bad. Lower rates attract all kinds of people who are rough around the edges. For example the parking area here is a little seedy and needs a little sprucing up. However this hotel does a good job keeping the entrance lobby area rooms and food court areas clean. P.S. Try to eat elsewhere as all these in-hotel eateries are crazy expensive.  Overall a fine choice with a decent location. I actually walked here from the airport. I would stay consider this place again.
20,As soon as I entered the room the first thing I noticed is how haphazardly the beds were made. If it’s one thing housekeeping staff at hotels always know how to neatly fold and tuck a bed. Our beds looked like an 8 year old did it. The room furniture is ok but can use a refresh. The bathroom definitely needs a update. The fixtures are worn and dull grout discolored. And the WALLS ARE SO THIN. I can hear every cough laugh and conversation through the connecting door to the room next door. If you’re in and out and not spending much time in the room maybe it’s ok. But I would definitely not stay here again. This was a free trip that I was selected for so no loss to me.
50,Excellent treatment. We had top notch service from beginning to end and the staff went out of their way to ensure our needs were met. We had excellent desk service plus our maid service was outstanding.
30,If you are looking for a cheap place to stay. Here is your place. No Frills well worn rooms and the added expense of parking and limited pool access. Hotel only opened limited pools which means a crowded experience to relax in the pool.
30,If you stay here make sure you’re at one of the most expensive rooms if not then you’ll get trash. My first night I got put in the wrong room by mistake but the staff took care of it. the rest of my nights were in the right room but the walk distance was long
40,No major complaints. Clean hotel friendly staff and a decent location. My only complaint would be that after requesting to have the room serviced I still do not receive service after 10 hours later.
50,Casino was 'live' with plenty action on week nights  Mon. thru Thur. Reasonable table limits and good dealers. Easy to navigate from Luxor to Mandalay Bay and Excalibur on the tram. Luxor will be my base casino going forward if casino Host will cooperate 😎
40,I think its been awhile since some areas have had some love and attention. I'm hoping they address these areas soon as I usually enjoy this hotel. Seems to have some continued plumbing issues as on 2 recent trips there they same plumbing issue happened in both rooms. Also was disappointed that at the bar nearest the Sports Book had no ice on a really HOT day there recently. Not sure who's on top of things there!!
10,No in room services such as microwaves fridge or coffee pots. Air was substandard at best. They make you pay for parking and then on top of that you have to pay for a resort fee. Majority of the restaurants and stores in the facility close early and open late. We found ourself at the 24 hr Subway or McDonalds after about midnight or before 11 am. Prices in the stores are extremely high we had a rental so we were able to go to Walgreens or the convenience store across the street and get things much cheaper.
30,all moving walkways are broken so expect to walk twice as much as you should have to. no 3:2 blackjack exists no $5 or even $10 minimum tables. roulette is also rigged with a 3rd green. no fridge or microwave in the rooms.
30,We had stayed at the Luxor several times but it had been a long time. I have always loved the Egyptian decor. It is at the far end of the strip near the airport but ubers are frequent. Had a great steak meal at a restaurant. Had a suite with a tub looking outside with a slanted ceiling. Room smelled heavily of smoke.
50,To start out I must commend our casino host Scott for setting up this trip Miquel and Cameron the cabana hosts made our trip most memorable they set us up daily with our favorite chairs and each day our servers Jesse Cathy Tony and the rest gave us the best service one could want. We stay at the pool all day and they are the best. Mlife rewards is the way to go Wendy and the mlife desk made sure we were set up for this perfect trip. Rooms are great tenders dinner with John and Allan always the best. Can’t wait to go again
10,I was in town recently for a trade show and unfortunately I wasn't involved in booking the hotel for our 3 day event. To say this place has seen better days would be an understatement. Rooms (East and West towers) were outdated dirty and had an off odor to them. I opened the door to a room filled with carpet stains worn our furniture and a disgusting bathroom-especially the shower which had caulk missing in multiple areas and mold in other areas. I doubt this will ever happen but MGM needs to invest big $$$'s to bring this place to a level that is even remotely competitive with the other nearby properties. Even better why not knock it all down and build something new! Frankly they should be embarrassed!
50,We enjoy our staying safe and relaxinghopefully we come back soon.thank you to the whole staff for a wonderful service and make our staying memorable.Casino staff offering drinks or beverages all times and knowledge about shows and things to do in Vegas. Definitely one of the best places in Vegas
30,Over priced hotel super tight slots drinks were served in mini glasses( three sips the drink was gone) so the wait began for the waitress to return while you sit and spend money. The overall suite was ok but was led to believe the rooms had been renovated  coffee maker coffe and confiments were not in the room I had to request it the mlife lounge was closed so the normal perks were not given and no incentive to replace it.
50,There are clean rooms not far from the casino floors at the Luxor. Pool was a blast and huge. Walkways to Mandalay bay and Excalibur made access to dining and the strip a breeze. Awesome bang for your buck location. Blue man group was fun!
20,Pre-pandemic this place was a nice stay. Now I’d be hesitant to recommend it. The rooms smell of smoke and weed the AC doesn’t work consistently and there’s weird leaks from the faucets. Very discount motel feel now.
40,Staff was great maybe a little slow.. but honestly might be very busy had some problems with our first room with the shower being terribly backed up and smelly but was fixed after complaining. I completely enjoyed my stay afterwards
30,I wanted to stay in the most affordable hotel that MGM was comping me at and Luxor met my expectations for the price but next time I think I'll stay at Aria or the Bellagio.    Staff was friendly the room was clean but there was an issue with the digital key working for additional guests so I had to print a key card. The elevators move weirdly because the hotel is shaped like a pyramid. Also the sensors in the elevators weren't working properly socit was hard to use your key card to go to your floor.
50,Very happy with stay I love the fact that staff customer service is excellent. All staff members great you and happy to be there. The pool is very clean also with great staff to help you with anything you need. I discovered this time around they have a free rail that takes you to Mandalay or Excalibur if your up to exploring Las Vegas. On Sundays they have Sunday Temptation which is for a plus for all LGBT community.
30,Cool elevators. Connected to Mandalay Bay and Excalibur. Stadium Walk right outside. A little more affordable than other resorts on the strip. Staff quickly addressed my problem.  Cons: That I had a problem in the 1st place. Toilet either going to explode or not effective enough. Shower spills water on the bathroom floor since there are only half doors.
10,The Luxor used to be a very nice experience. Not this time. Room was unacceptable. Leftover food and candy remnants when I checked into room first day electrical outlets didn't work and not cleaned properly every day. Halls to room were filthy
40,We had a great stay at Luxor. The staff was friendly and the casino restaurant and our room was very clean. The only negative I would say is that there is no refrigerator in your room and so many of the restaurants have decently sized portions and we had no where to put them. We felt wasteful since we couldn't take anything back with us. Our room was nicely setup and the beds were quite comfy. The only restaurant we really liked was Devils Cantina. The pyramid cafe was expensive for the quality of food and the Public House was incredibly slow so we ate elsewhere.
50,This casino and hotel were amazing!! The food was good it was exceptionally clean the price was perfect and everything you could possibly need was within walking distance. I will definitely be back next year!
50,The parking fee is a charge that should be dropped. I can do with out the reward money $40 slot pay and $50 entertainment money. I know many casinos charge for parking but it is a charge which makes me want to stay somewhere else. $15 a day is steep for me . That could have been slot money to play with but I had to pay for parking.
10,Can I give zero stars? We are here for 6 nights for a conference and I’d leave right this minute if I could.  This place is so run down and dirty. Broken stuff everywhere.  The most irritating thing is not having a coffee maker in the room. I’ve never paid over $1000 to stay somewhere and not been supplied with a simple coffee maker.  There is no microwave or fridge either.  Not only is coffee very expensive I have to walk forever to get it.  I hate this place.
40,I have stayed here many times. I like the easy and fast check in on my phone. NO line.. downside was the eateries opened too late.. 10 am. Need more options to get something to eat without going out to the strip.
10,Just made beds no cleaning came there for bdays for two sons. Half food places not open. No fridge in room. Mentioned it was my sons 21 and 22 birthday and they didn’t even offer anything I can do to celebrate
40,Stay was great. Except for 1 problem we had. We found a cockroach in the bathroom of out hotel room. When I tried to kill the roach it ran back inside the tank of the toilet. Besides that it would have been a prefect stay.
10,Rooms are not cleaned let alone sanitized and housekeeping steals things. When we checked in the bathtub was disgusting and when I showered the shower was clogged. I was only there for 2 nights and they came to unclog the shower till next morning. I had a birthday dinner that we had to cancel because only one was able to shower since the water wouldn’t drain if somejj in be else would have showered the water would have over flowed. After finally coming to unclog housekeeping came right after that and all they did was the bed. The shower and the bathtub were both so gross that I had to clean it when got in to shower plus I noticed that two bags of lollipops I brought with me were gone. There was a coffee machine but no coffee or cups or anything. $300+/night not worth it. Motel 6 would have been better had I known.
30,I wished too have had same type of room provided being 1- bedroom suite separate from living room space too bedroom along separate bathrooms and rooms provided had no amenities of the sort as previous stays! The room was requested rush service upon check inn before 3 PM but upon checking of room hour later past check inn time room wasn’t ready was provided corner room had no way in doubt been worse room I’ve seen Luxor has had!  Value of my Birthday was shown too me throughout all staff including Jason Bell Man too Maria & Muska Housekeeping!  Cabana was amazing along with good time craps table but as for my experience for room the expectations from previous stays showed rooms provided weren’t close too what I’ve had that more suitable! 2020 was better stay then 2021
30,Hotel was nice. Unfortunately you could tell rooms weren’t deeply cleaned before we checked in. Customer service was 8/10. Showers don’t have a door not sure why since it just makes a mess in the restroom.
40,I'm originally from Cairo Egypt and when I decide to go to Vegas I ONLY stayed at Luxor it has a unique experience that you don't get anywhere else on the Strip . . It's Clean and located right across the airport . .
50,Excellent customer service. Great stay. Had some issues with the hotel room at first by the staff fixed it but upgrading our room and making sure that we were comfortable. Everyone at the Luxor was very friendly and sought to take care of all of our needs and wants and did.
50,Quick check in nice and very clean hotel and casino view was great and fun games! House keeping was fast with my needs and great deals on area to get drinks down in the casino I will be returning for another stay!
40,After reading the reviews I was worried about the shape we would find this hotel in. I was amazed that it was not anything like many of reviews I had read. We had a king pyramid room on the 10th floor. Yes the casino and elevators smell like marijuana yes the casino area is dark yes the elevators are not in the best of shape and yes there were lines to check in (but also at every other hotel we visited) but otherwise our stay was good. Our room was clean and housekeeping came everyday of our 5 day stay. We had working A/C (it was 108 outside when we visited) and our room was updated and comfortable. Pool area was nice.
50,Everything was amazing. Great customer was amazing. Rooms were amazing. Thank you !! Staff was friendly. Food was great. Everything was what I expected. Met my expectations. Thank you Luxor for your hard working staff!
50,Really good. There were a couple of snags around the use of comps dealing with the Spa but it was resolved very nicely. The front desk was extremely nice and responded very quickly to all requests. We will come back another time!!
10,I will not be returning to Vegas. I dont understand how smoking cigarettes is prohibited in hotels but people are smoking weed in the rooms and at pool side. I get that it's legal but I should not have to be subjected to it in the Casino in the elevator and on my floor. If that's the clientele you want that's fine bit I won't be one of them
50,I love the Luxor! I really enjoy staying in the pyramid just because it's so interesting. I also love the Titanic exhibit and the Bodies exhibit was also really interesting to see both of which are right there. The food is really good. I wish the sushi restaurant had been open while I was there. I got one of the wellness rooms in the pyramid--the environment is really relaxing. I even got a little lucky at one of the slot machines.    The Luxor has been our go-to hotel for almost every trip to Las Vegas. The main draw is the cost--it is one of the cheaper hotels on the strip but you still get high quality rooms that feel more expensive. Checking in and checking out is really easy and the bellhop who was going to store my luggage (I had arrived early and my room wasn't quite ready) was super-friendly. I'll be back!
50,This Hotel/Casino is by far the Best place to stay when you visit Las Vegas! The employees are very Courteous and Pleasant  The Rooms are Extremely clean and well stocked I look forward to my next visit which will be here and only here at the :Luxor And if your a Mlife member you might get free tickets to see George Strait like we did on this last trip
40,The Luxor was a great place to stay. Beautiful clean. Good value for your dollar. Location was excellent. It was a comfortable stay and a great way to spend my birthday. The amenities were wonderful I really enjoyed the pool with swim up bar
50,I really enjoyed my stay at the Luxor Hotel & Casino! My tower king room was spectacularly spacious clean & comfortable. The gaming was fun & exciting and the food & drinks were satisfying! I will definitely be staying at this MGM property again! I loved the location as well...top of the strip! 😊
50,We always choose Luxor when we stay in Las Vegas. The friendly and attentive staff make us feel like VIP every time we stay. The pool is clean and fun the food and drink service never disappoints. We are returning at the end of the month and look forward to the buffet reopening.
50,Once I am there the ambience is so relaxing and friendly. The room is absolutely clean and COVID-19 prepared. The food is delicious and priced reasonably. There’s always a staff member nearby for any service I might need.
50,Went to Vegas for my birthday with friends so much fun..... I would recommend Vegas and Luxor to anyone because of the experience and friendliness there.... Food games and rooms are amazing... Can't wait to go back...
50,Recently injured my knee as I was traveling to Las Vegas and decided to continue with staying at the Luxor their staff saw me struggling with a bum knee and helped me to my room and 2 days later back to my car. Ended up having to rent a scooter to get around and enjoy my visit. Will be back.
20,I was there for work and stayed a week. The line to check in is ridiculous so I used the app and it will not let you change the cc after check in. So I had to wait in that ridiculously long line anyway.- twice! I changed the cc- twice because they didn't do it the first time.! I waited in that stupid long line forever and they told me they changed it...only to have to makethe same journey through that ridiculously long line the following day... You may be thinking it's just a line but it's not just a line after you're working a 14 hour day on your feet and you are exhausted-you just want to go to your room or use the convenient app that they've given you. Then when I get home- my cc still got charged. They are incompetent!  They are understaffed and it is run down. The elevator buttons on the 16th floor of the west tower only work on one side. Just down the hall from that there is a big chunk of the floor missing in the tile they have had a cone there for a week. The elevator's buttons inside the actual elevators well half of them work only on one side. It looks like they were housing all the drug addicts and homeless people here during covid. There are so many things I could complain about I just would not ever go there again. Last but not least somehow as I was trying to complain to these people about their app and the many issues I ended up discovering they sell your information and you have to go through a ton of steps just to unsubscribe and get them to NOT SELL your information check out the picture I TOOK A SCREEN SHOT.
30,We stayed at the Luxor and the ol gal is a tired hotel. our room was ok but the end tables were chipped it just looked beat up. I remember the Luxor as one of the nicest hotels in Vegas...Casino was so so....felt kind of dirty....
30,While the lobby of the Luxor hotel was absolutely beautiful the rooms themselves were far from spectacular. Not only did our shower have no door on it but we also were provided no soap (including hand soap). The staff were all very nice but the rooms could use some major updating.
50,Very nice clean place to stay during our business visit. It was close to our conference location at Mandalay Bay but much more affordable. None of the outdoor fountains were operating in the pool area which was disappointing but it was relaxing none the less. The staff was all super friendly except the pool waitresses. We overheard them telling a guest that they were only going to bring water if they were given a tip and don’t walk all around for nothing...from our view the guest seemed pleasant and not intoxicated so we weren’t sure what started the hostility. But our service at the pool was less than desirable for the amount we were paying for drinks and food. El Diablo restaurant was particularly delicious and the staff were all amazing! We would definitely return.
40,Loved how the inside of the casino looked was clean and the beds were very comfortable. We stayed in the Pyramid rooms and I sort of wish they were more Egyptian themed but that's just my personal opinion.
50,It was a great stay  Great staff  Had to rent fridge and microwaves  Had to pay for late check out  But other than that it was a great stay lots to see and do! Definitely recommended as it connects to the other hotels as well!
10,The reservations system is terrible I booked a specific room got an inferior old room but they charged me the same price. They charged my credit card about 9 different times amounts that don't make sense. The people working there seem unhappy are not friendly some are very rude. Rooms are 25 years outdated this was a terrible experience from check in to check out and everything in between. Fire alarm went off in the middle of the night no explanation no apology and it took like 15 minutes to deactivate it.
50,Very fun place. I went to the Psycho Fest at Mandalay Bay and it is a very short walk about a little more than 5 minutes to the House of Blues. Always a great value. The Luxor is also in between Mandalay Bay and Excalaber which makes going to the strip very easy.
50,This was my 4th time at the Luxor and my cousin and I loved our stay. We came in August and were concerned about the heat. Even though it was hot there was no humidity and it felt very comfortable. The Pyramid Cafe was very organized and wonderful food. Our room had no view but who stays in the room much? We will be back!
20,No fridge in room. If you need to leave for the airport before 6am there is no bellman and no luggage carts available. If you want to be in the midst of everything this is not the location stay north.
40,I've stayed at a few other MGM Properties but I like the Luxor better than the MGM Grand. It feels more personal and friendly. Our Flight was delayed coming in but they held our room and helped us relax; when we finally got there.
10,This place is a complete dump carpets stained air conditioning did not work just lip service from the staff no response after three calls. Tipped the housekeeper $20 each night for three nights never got a thank you despite running into her. This hotel needs a complete make over. The restaurants were all booked that is if they were even open.
10,Wrote my initials in the dust in the nightstand. Hair in the tub. Service at tender steak house was amazing! Valet was great once I got to park.make sure there isn’t an event they don’t save any hotel guest spots.
30,We go to Vegas a lot since we live in Scottsdale haven't stayed in Luxor in at least 10 years. I am a comped guest and all Mlife Hotels I was SHOCKED entering the Pyramid Room I was assigned it honestly was worse than Motel 6. Beds were horrible bathrooms in dire need of updating Mirror on Wall flacking a peeling walls dirty. I immediately went to front desk and they moved us to a Tower Strip View Room which was a LOT nicer. DO not book a Pyramid room unless you like a motel 6 vibe.... Not for me..
40,Overall I liked my stay . Room was clean modern  and un crowded. The ONLY thing I do not like is that we have to pay for parking even if we’re staying there. That just makes no sense to me other than that I recommend Pyramid Cafe
30,MGM App is the bomb! Pricing isn’t transparent and misleading the pricing isn’t even close to accurate. Rooms need repair and refresh. Need mini fridges in rooms! Casino needs new carpets and repairs and more sanitizing stations. Casino is short staff and overall the Luxor really gives you the feeling of a casino that has outlived its prime.
10,I love visiting Luxor but after booking a room here this will be my last time. From not being able to find both of my reservations to rude staff barely helping and hanging up after very basic questions. Every time I’ve woken up here I’ve found more and more hidden fees been told I can’t use my points anywhere and have gotten denied for using my military discount at stores and places in here. They told us I got a complimentary upgrade for the room. The point of this trip was to experience our year anniversary IN the Luxor. Ended up staying in a hotel way away from it. We are looking at the Luxor from our room. But that’s considered an upgrade?
50,I had a great experience at the Luxor on my business trip. Super Clean Safety in place for Covid quiet in my room so I could work and get a great night sleep. Tons of Amenities and Great Value Will definitely be back.
30,Not the best but not the worst. I would say this is a mid-tier hotel that's good for people who want to be close to all the fun stuff on the strip without spending a fortune on their room. Staff was friendly and rooms were clean.
10,They charge you $15 a night for parking even when staying there. The self parking garage is a long walk to check in.There is no fridge in the room. You can get one but have to pay for that too! You would be better off staying in a Ceaser's property.
30,Hotel seems a bit run down from the last time I was there. Needs a good cleaning and maintenance. The smell of people smoking weed in the hallways and in adjacent rooms was very troubling. Elevators also seemed very shaky.
20,We stayed here because it was a little cheaper than some of the other hotels on the strip but after the poor customer service the other expenses and the disappointment with the pool it wasn't worth it. We should have stayed somewhere else.
10,Initial room the beds were mussed and smelled bad. The replacement room had crumbs on the nightstand nasty looking splatters under the toilet seat and hair! The shower had longs hairs on the wall and visible soap scum. Behind the tissue box was a receipt and old tissue! The desk chair had a garment tag and papers on it. The tabletop blackened our Lysol Wipe. It was really awful but we knew not to ask for a third room so we just cleaned it.
50,I’ve been staying here for years with friends or I book myself.  I stayed here twice this year and every time I receive excellent service. Friendly staff and a really clean room.  The elevators in the pyramid need a major upgrade that’s the only negative.  But the tower rooms are great. I highly recommend staying in the tower.
50,The Luxor made us feel Welcome to be there. Our room was clean and as requested near the elevator to accommodate my 92 year old mother-in-law! Our favorite stop during the day is the Back Street Deli that serves the BEST ONION RINGS EVER!
40,Novelty of staying in a pyramid shaped hotel was cool but it lacked some of the amenities of nicer hotels like room service coffee & fridge. Location was great parking was easy casino was nice and restaurants were decent. Wouldn’t stay again but worth doing it once. :)
10,The room was outdated. There is a light fixture hanging in the middle of the walkway that I hit my head on due to a missing table and chairs. The air conditioning worked on and off throughout the night to where my wife had to go to sleep on the couch in the living room and I woke up sweating. The chair was missing at the desk. There was no hair dryer. The alarm clock was missing. In the morning there was no hot water to take a shower. The exhaust fan in the bathroom did not work so when you did get hot water it steamed the mirror to where you have to wait 10 to 15 minutes before you can get ready. Our overall experience was terrible. I do not recommend staying in a room that is not updated at the Luxor.
20,Put in the basement. Room had no cell coverage had to go to main level to make a call. Air conditioning not working in room drains wouldn’t drain. Waited on hold for over an hour for front desk and could never get through on numerous days. When I went to front desk at end of trip all they took off was fees that they added to room.
50,From the time I checked in till the time we left everything was amazing! The best staff works at Luxor. Me and ny wife enjoyed the casino and the Titanic Experience that they offer. Overall stay was great and look forward to coming back
20,Outdated. We stayed here for the Titanic exhibit. I wouldn’t stay here again unless they did a bunch of upgrades or it was free. Everything was outdated. The shower didn’t work and it was a constant dance in and out because the water temp was constantly changing. The room was clean and it was convenient for what we wanted but I won’t be staying here again.
40,As a kid I really enjoyed this resort. I’m 39 now and like me it’s starting to show its age. The south end of the strip has always been my favorite. Luxor is in a perfect location. We were attending an event at Allegiant stadium and it was a very short walk over to Mandaly Bay where they had a convenient walking path straight to the stadium. 15 minute walk at most. I hope this hotel gets the attention it needs in the way of room upgrades and cosmetic appearance. Rooms are fine I believe some are already updated. Just don’t go expecting anything super nice.
20,Sorry Luxor but there was nothing in my stay to really get excited about. The rooms were very dated and just plain blah. Service from checkin was ok was not asked if I would like any upgrades or upon checkout how my stay was. Guests have to pay for parking. All in all I would not recommend nor would I consider returning
50,Stayed at the Luxor on a Friday night. I was overcharged nearly $200 at check out after booking my reservation directly with them online 2 months in advance. The hotel itself is beautiful well maintained very clean and has great casino games throughout the hotel. I liked their food court and the walking paths to go to other hotels. It was nice just not the stay or the rooms unfortunately.
40,The hotel and casino were great. Even the Steakhouse was tremendous. Only negative thing was the parking situation. No valley parking and self parking was really far. I ended up taking a Lyft ride instead of walking all the way back to my car.
50,We love it here! Always treated very well It’s clean a quieter hotel. When dining at the Pyramid Cafe always ask for Peggy and Tony. They will be a highlight of your trip! Helpful and full of laughs!
20,Definitely will not choose this hotel again no matter the deal. Elevators took forever to arrive. Food in hallway for 2 days. Odors from sink and in hallways that smelled like sulfur. Only positive part if the stay was the staff we encountered.
10,We stayed at the Luxor this weekend and it's the last time we'll stay there. The shower drained so slowly it almost overflowed into the bathroom floor. Not that it would've mattered because there's no shower curtain or door so water gets all over the floor anyway. The AC worked about as well as an evaporating cooler. It didn't cool the room and the temperature of the room stayed warm and humid. All of our outlets were so loose that when we tried to plug in our chargers or my straightener they would wiggle and come unplugged with any touch or movement. Every single elevator we got on rattled and shook. On the last day we were commenting on it to other people in the elevator. Then we asked if their AC worked and 2 people said theirs didn't work either. Over all I would not recommend. Spend the extra money on a newer better maintained hotel.
50,porque la gente que trabaja en Luxor es muy amable y respetuosa y le ayudan a uno en lo que pueden y son muy serviciales y yo se lo recomiendo a mis amigos y con la tarjeta m life me ayudó because people working in Luxor are very kind and respectful and help one in what they can and are very helpful and I recommend it to my friends and with my life card it helped me quite a lot
10,The walk to the room had to be atleast 12 minutes no smoking rooms no refrigerator horrible ac in room and the shower drain was clogged i will be staying at the treasure island hotel next time its way better.
20,Confusing layout 4 separate elevators to go to your floor no refrigeration available for food leftovers and expensive tables for this cheap hotel. The location was ok and tram was accessible from the hotel but aside from Carrot Top there wasn’t much to keep you in this casino.
50,What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas. So that being said all I can say is my trip last year was interrupted due to Covid-19 so I was glad to travel once more to Vegas and stay at one of Vegas's great hotel.
10,Room smells like mold. TV did not work. Food from previous guest left in the drawers that was not cleaned out. I stayed here because it was the convention hotel. If you can find another hotel I would recommend it. Vegas has gotten extremely expensive. Bottle of water $5
40,Pyramid rooms were too hot for me  Tower rooms are better  Service was good  Mexican restaurant was great!  Connects to other resorts so that’s nice  Even won some at the casino  Pool is neat  Overall stay was good!
50,The Luxor has always been a pleasant experience for my wife and I. We have been coming here many years. We feel comfortable there and are always treated wonderfully. Check in is easy and likewise checkout. We will always stay at the Luxor when we visit Las Vegas.
30,I like the Luxor but it needs some repairs and maintenance in the room and floors. Things in the room like slightly tattered curtains and peeling paint discoloration on the bathroom ceiling dusty ceiling fans and leaking shower doors are unsightly. We also noticed missing covers for the card access panels in the elevators and missing sprinkler plates on the ceiling on our floor by the elevators. Although the glitz and glamor of the main areas are your first impression the room is where a guest truly forms their opinion. I was a little disappointed in our rooms presentation but overall it did not impact my stay. I just wish a little more care was put into rooms.
10,I booked 2 suites and had to move 3 times since none of the rooms in the pyramid had adequate air conditioning. Completely ruined the trip and you could not sleep in room since they wouldn't get below 78 degrees. Stay far away from this hotel unless you like miserably hot rooms 40+ minute waits to the front desk and bell hops that don't show up when called.
30,The Luxor overall was good. I do think it is beginning to show some signs of its age. All areas were clean and well maintained though. Just wish rooms had refrigerators and coffee makers. It would be a nice additional perk.
10,No air conditioning/ made my family wait in the hallway after a 10 hr travel day! Kids sleeping in strollers / waiting to eat and change. But had to wait over a hr just to get the room solved . After I had to go back down and wait in the check in line again for a hr. Then dirty room  uncleaned air purifiers /clogged!!!! Disgusting 🤮. My life couldnt even give me my free play and food comps even with a email from the Luxor stating it! Service was horrible and casino was dirty! Worst pool in Vegas  if u have kids any other pool is better trust me!!
50,Went for a Girls Trip and this hotel was great! Location was perfect and there were so many things to do inside the hotel! Food was great! The Pyramid Cafe is a great place for breakfast! I recommend this hotel for a fun experience!
20,"I've stayed here MANY times so wasn't expecting such a bad experience. Renovated room was missing a table which I didn't know was supposed to be there. Would have been helpful when had dinner in my room one night and when I used my computer. Instead I had to sit on my bed for both. Clogged sink which didn't get fixed for over 6 hours and more than one phone call to get someone up to do it. Casino was not cool enough for 106 heat outside. Short staffed in all areas that we came across. A few very rude staff although most were great. Security was in serious need of people who take that job seriously. Like when someone entered my daughter's room while she was there and when security finally showed up she gets a ""what's up guys"". How about maybe ""are you okay""?? And maybe having instructions on how to double lock the door posted where it was supposed to be. I can verify there were no such instructions in my daughter's room and she'd never been in a place where raising the handle double locked the door. I've completely wiped Luxor off my list of places to stay in Vegas. There's far more places than Luxor!"
20,The air conditioner was not working properly and I put a deposit on a room in the pyramid but received on in the east tower away from my family. The pool area was great but this is not what I expected.
30,The Luxor was great. My only issues were that the room was quite difficult to locate because there were no workers at the front desk to guide us and the air conditioner in our room did not get cold. Also there was only one glass door to the shower which caused lots of water to get on the floor. However we had fresh sheets and towels everyday.
50,Nice and relaxing  it was quiet and we were able to rest  great location right by the allegiant stadium highly recommended if you want to relax and enjoy the peace and quiet in your room when you have a long day and night out
40,M Life program offered me a 4night stay without resort fees. $75 Free play $100 comp. What a great deal that was it able me to gamble more. Good food and endless drinks. Great get away at the right time for me.
20,Services along with cleanliness and room upkeep was absolutely subpar. Some restaurants are still closed and remaining selection of open restaurants were minimal. My main concern would be for the safety and well-being of the guests. There should be more of a security presence in the casino especially around the tower elevators.
50,My little family enjoyed the trip very much. We definitely look forward to booking again with you. We loved our trip and were even upgraded to a suite. The room was absolutely beautiful and clean. The staff was very helpful and kind. We definitely got a really good deal on the room.
50,This was a short trip a needed getaway. Got to see Michael Jackson ONE as it was the 1st show since closing 17 months ago and it was spectacular. Always enjoy going to Vegas to spend alone time to relax.
50,Checked in and out on their app and it was perfect. Had a blast. It was nice to be in a casino that wasnt slam packed with people. You could actually get to tables and the staff was very friendly. Will go again.
10,If you love stinky noisy hotels this is your place. Floor / room wreaked of pot. Extremely loud and rowdy guests were allowed to party in room and halls unchecked making it impossible to sleep. Internet did not function.
50,"I was unable to edit my review so I did delete my review so I could repost with an update. I want to start off by saying that I was not asked to update my review I am doing so because customer service truly changed my entire opinion.    ***Update August 20 2021  I received a message from MGM and I was very pleased. Between their response to review and reply to the message I had sent back I can truly say that they went above and beyond. I have had companies bad to poor reviews before a 9 times out of 10 the replies are scripted and hardly give solutions. I have come to expect those so as you can imagine It meant a lot to recieve a message from MGM that was kind and truly made me feel heard. I am so impressed with the customer service; blown away really. I was worried my concerns would seem petty. l understand that we were woken up only roughly an hour before check-out but due to my wifes health sleep is extremely important and because we were running on so little as it is that hour was a pretty big percentage of the total sleep we'd gotten all weekend. This was the first weekend in a while that my wife was not in debilitating pain so we took advantage and we stayed out late. I appreciate the level of understanding we have recieved from MGM.    I cannot say it enough. They are amazing. The agent I spoke to deserves a massive raise. I have never had my opinion changed so quickly.    Thank you. MGM    ****Review #1 - posted on August 17 2021  I usually enjoy the Luxor but this last trip was terrible. I paid for early check-in so I could leave New York New York at 11 am then come right to the hotel. I didn't get my room until 2pm (yall still took my money for early check in tho) but the real issue here was the fact I was woken up an hour before checkout to pounding at my door to ""see if we had left yet.""  First of all we packed everything and took a nap before our road trip home since we had limited sleep.  Second of all I paid to stay there until 11am. Do. Not. Rush. People. It is absolutely ridiculous that we had to wake up 45 mins early when we specifically packed and made sure we were ready to leave when we woke up just so you could pound on our door to rush us.  Next time I'll be placing a sign on my door to let your workers know that check out is 11am. Not 10. And they are not to pound on the door to rush me. Thats just so beyond rude. You needing rooms is not my problem. If you overbooked too bad. If you didn't overbook... then I'd like to know why you are not waiting until check out to see if people have ya know.... checked out. Instead you choose to go down the hall pounding on everyone's door. So annoying."
20,Stay was average overall. The room was not cleaned properly (the side tables were not wiped down. And there were crumbs on the counters and floor) and check in was a mess (I used mobile app and it said everything was good. I waited a couple hours for my keys. Then waited in a long line to ask and be told my card didn't process right.)
10,Awful. Parking is far from the registration desk. It’s also not clearly marked so it was hard to find in the dark. My room had roaches in the bathroom and dust on the tables. The bedding was stained. I called and got a new room. No bugs seen but it’s not well cared for. Stained and peeling caulk. Black spots in the caulk. Bathtub has dirt in the bottom. No washcloths in the bathroom. Toilet is 2 different colors and the wallpaper is peeling off the wall in the hallway. This is ridiculous to me. This was in a tower premium room. I won’t be back.
30,I know it's an older property and while the casino area was very cleaned there are areas not maintained. The moving walkways were constantly down between the Luxor and Excalibur. The room A/C didn't cool enough and the bathroom outlet didn't work. Room itself was clean but when I looked at the A/C grates on the unit when it wouldn't cool it was very disgusting inside. Bathroom door wouldn't open all the way and just scraped the tile floor. No casino host available either!
30,Short 15 min walk to Allegiant Stadium room was okay could use an upgrade atmosphere at Public House was upbeat and lively. Food at Luxor (Pyramid Cafe & Public House) was okay reminded me of Denny's with the exception of Diablos...which was delicious! I definitely recommend Diablos!
20,The digital keys were not working. We had to get physical keys. When we walked up to our room there were dirty dishes right outside our door. Took 1 full day to clean it up. Bedding had stains was gross.
10,My rating of the property may not be fair. We never saw much of the property due to a reservation cancelation from staff. Staff needs to be more attentive to emails of late arrivals due to flight delays!
30,This hotel could've been better if it was upgrade it. More cleanliness and sanitized. Overall experience great Customer service. Also did not have enough security staff working. The pools did not have umbrellas on side. The food court was close to early every day even on the weekends.
20,I thought it was going to be a luxury hotel butthe service and rooms seemed average and not that well kept. The check in had a line that was longer than those at Disney and the speed of Walmart cashiers.  Maybe I expected more from such an impressive and beautifully designed place.
20,Rooms AC didn't work called once to have it checked not sure if it happened while we left to eat and get into some AC. Came back later in the evening and it was still hot in the room. Called again and they ended up bringing us a fan. The icing on the cake is that the TV was stuck on the sci-fi channel. Great watching twilight zone in a hot room. 🤙🏼🤦‍♂️
50,The Luxor is the perfect Resort stay while in Vegas. Everything you need is there and it's Beautiful. Definitely will stay again. It was me and my husband 1st trip to vegas and it was a Great one! Luxor Has everything you need and want in a hotel resort and casino!
40,Leisure trip…we vacation about every three weeks in Vegas I would give it 5 stars overall if there was no charge for late check out and parking …those are not star options! We have stayed at many hotels in Vegas and I was always scared to stay at Luxor because of the price point being on the lower end but we were shocked at how beautiful the rooms were how the staff was so sweet! We loved the mobile check in and out and the pool was large enough to make you feel like you were at an expensive resort…servers and staff were laid back and super sweet! Never experienced a staff that look like they actually love their jobs!! We enjoyed easy access to surrounding casinos and it was really cool to stay in the pyramid…the vibe was really cool! The elevators could use an update! 🤗 Overall we really enjoyed it and would definitely stay again!!!
30,Hotel is cheap but you get what you paid for.  Bad: Weird smell when you enter the room bedding is too short for the bed loud AC.  Good: The room is pretty big in size check-in could be done online without staying in line.
50,The Luxor is located in a perfect location!! The staff was exceptionally friendly and knowledgeable. I was very pleased with my stay here. There are so many places to see and visit inside the resort! Will be back!
30,They sure do love adding service fees to everything....had no idea that paying extra for early check in I would be charged a service fee on top of that. Hate that once you open your hotel room door to exit into lobby you can smell cigarette smoke right away which creeps into your room leaving the smell to linger inside. Food court was basic. Prices are definitely out of hand.
10,Room was filthy casino machines were grimy. Diablo's cantina had great guacamole and salsa but the menu was tiny and the food not great! Ate breakfast at the cafe and the food was mediocre and way overpriced!
30,Only half a shower door in the shower so water went everywhere and I had to mop it up with the clean towels. There were sugar ants in the room everywhere. Staff was friendly enough and we won some money.
20,I was upset because I upgraded my remolded premier room to a suite and the suite looked like a downgrade. It was not newly remodeled and the toilet was stopped up. I called about it. After holding for about 15 minutes they told me they did not have a remodeled suite for me. Then my friends checked in shortly after and received a newly remodeled suite. I do want to hear back and receive some assistance regarding this matter.
40,I loved the view of the coliseum and how short of a walk it was to get to the game. Great restaurant options and short line for cabs to other areas. I wish we had booked another day or two. The lights at night on the building are also crazy cool!!
20,They had offered me a comp stay and it was fairly cheap for my other friends that joined the trip. The sink would not drain I called the front desk within minutes of entering the room asking they fix it while I am out with my friends. Needless to say it was not fixed so ended up removing a panel and popping up the drain plug to remove it. I was upgraded to a newly renovated room if this is what they considered renovated then some serious parties happen in these rooms. The noise level in the tower rooms are pretty bad between the people and the airport. Do want to point out I did call the hotel before the trip to try and arrange with a host a cabana spa and dinner reservations. They could care less about the visit no matter the status. Ended up making my own reservations and spending most of my time at Mandalay.
40,Great stay other than the ride bell hop it was a great time. Atmosphere was great casino was fun and filled with great music. The vibes here at the hotel were just what me and my friends wanted in a hotel stay!
30,There’s no fridge and I found a few hairs in the bathroom some in the bathtub and one by the sink. I would not pay $140+ for this room ever. The only redeeming quality was getting free drinks for playing in the casino and the location of the strip.
30,Will not stay here in the future.. The rooms were not that clean we had to get our rooms switched.. I also did not like the location of the hotel.. It’s at the very end of the strip. We did enjoy our dinner at the Tender Steakhouse!!! Very good!!
20,One tired old property...pyramid rooms are old and outdated..tower rooms are better and more up-to-date...very few food choices and not much still open...I would spend a few extra bucks and go to MGM or Paris or Ceasars
50,I had an amazing experience at the Luxor Thank you to all the staff that helped make that come true. Very impressed with all the help cleanliness and all around service. I will be staying at the Luxor again after this amazing experience!
10,After two requests to clean my room which had food and sticky dirty floors they only swept. Leaving the sticky dirty residue on floors. I was walked in on by staff two times without knocking. One time I was in process of changing.
30,Overall I enjoyed our stay at the Luxor. The rooms were clean comfortable and a great value for the price. What I did not enjoy was the poor customer service out on the casino floor and the life guards allowing some guest to take over the pool area and inconvenience the rest of the guest.
30,I found nothing exciting here. I stayed here years ago and liked it.  But rooms(at least the ones my daughter and son and in law) stayed were no frills not even a refrigerator to put a soda in. Check in lines were very long. I will say that most of the food I ate was good and I tried a few of them. I am most disappointed in the fact that the blackjack which I play was non existent. No tables open at breakfast time and all automatic shufflers which I refuse to play. Vegas in general is not the Vegas of Old very sorry to say.
20,Food that should’ve been stored in a refrigerator I placed on top of the air conditioner so they wouldn’t spoil. Not preferable but necessary I suppose since there was no refrigerator. This is the first time I’ve stayed in a room without a fridge. For the amount I paid for my room I was rather disappointed that all my liquids (Gatorade water etc) had to be at room temperature unless I refilled my ice bucket frequently. This hotel isn’t luxurious nor convenient but rather just basic. Also not clean and lots of noticeable dust. Safe wouldn’t open therefore my belongings weren’t protected. I’m grateful it was shelter for my 3 day stay but wouldn’t stay here again.
50,Excellent service staff friendly and helpful. Place has a good vibe feel good service in casino all staff was friendly if needed any assistance or had any questions. Rooms are clean has mini tram to Excalibur walk thru to excalibur or Mandalay Bay. Close to mgm to get on main monorail (walk thru NY NY to MGM.)
50,The hotel was fabulousclean plenty of towels and shampoo. Nice TV . The beds are very firm but still slept good. The rooms are very quiet . Great coffee in the morning wonderful food court lots of variety. The valet was beyond helpful super nice. My 50.00 Deposit was not refunded as directed at checkout it would go back to account the same day.
50,This was a very enjoyable vacation. I was satisfied with all in every way! The staff the service the pool area the restaurants the food the gaming area m life desk check in n check out. Was all great! An excellent vacation
30,We stayed just for one night. It wasn’t horrible. It’s at the end of the strip so it’s far from everything. The room seemed really warm and wouldn’t cool down. The pool area is big but doesn’t have a lot of shade. The spa and it’s team was great! They were very helpful and it was a nice way to start the trip.
50,Can’t wait to return this was the best hotel experience I’ve had in Vegas. Fun environment the design of the pyramid is so fun to look at I plan on traveling again next month and this will be the place I plan on staying !
40,I love this hotel but this is the second time our bed was worn out and didn't sleep well. We have stayed here alot but the beds need to be upgraded. TripAdvisor 200 minimum words is too much to type!!!
40,The hotel is very busy on the weekends went during the week and that was a really enjoyable. Careful with the people trying sell you time shares it’s a rip off. Complementary cocktails while playing the Casino
10,Not going ever again heard all night screaming sex noices that was awful imagine if i went with my kids honestly it was disturbing and worst thing that it was all night until the morning at 10:30 they stop
10,Room was very hot even with 2 coolers running day and night! Not even a drinking cup or water glass. Take your own bottles of water unless you want to pay 5.00 for a small bottle. Very disappointing for my first Vegas experience.
50,Luxur is just a great place for a vegas trip. It was so easy to check in and getting to our rooms couldn’t be more fast and easy. I loved our room. It was so clean and the stuff even better. I had a great experience.
30,Although the pyramid is a cool theme the elevator design is NOT cool. Certain elevator corridors only goes to certain floors. So walking back and forth to our room was a freaking journey. There were cracked walls near the elevator shaft. All I think of was the pyramid caving in on us. My biggest complaint is the pool closed at 7:00. Night swimming is my favorite and that was not happening at the Luxor.
10,The room was dirty the chairs were stained the picture online are not even close to what room looks like some of elevators buttons don’t work the carpet looked dirty and lifted like it had humid the AC wasn’t working room was hot
30,The Luxor is a good location trams to take you to the hotels on both sides easy access to restaurants casinos nice might stay there again but I like variety of stay at different places every time I’m in Vegas
20,Rooms were hot. No coffee maker no complimentary water in rooms. Rude staff. No comp. Couldn't reach a host. Slot machine not paying out. Selling water logged in pyramid looked like it was gonna fall in.
50,Had a great weekend stay at Luxor all staff was helpful and friendly they have great food late night after some drinks Best Wings In Public Bar.. The Suite We Had Was Really Nice If Your Every With Your Special Person..
40,The checkin Was pretty fast I did the online check in and I skipped the line the lady was kind enough to help me when the only checkin was not working. The room was good however the refrigerator was missing. Overall the room and bed was clean but some ash was on some parts of the furniture were not dusted .
10,Check in for my room was at 3 PM. I did not get my keys until around 4 PM when I had to beg the front desk agent to switch my room with someone who was not there yet. My fiancé and I had to sit around in the lobby waiting to be assigned a room number. Finally we decided to go get food hoping during our time at the restaurant I would get an email with my room number. Of course not. So we paid for our food and couldn’t use the $50 resort credit. I couldn’t even go and gamble with my free play because once again you needed a room number. We chose this hotel based on the perks and it was not worth the headache. No amenities could be used at all. HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!
10,Our room was old no frig. The furniture and decore was old and  not cohesive in style. Like the goodwill grab and decorate. Could not find a bell person to help carry our luggage to our room which was 12 floors up down a very long hallway. Along the hallway encountered old refrigerators bags of trash smell of weed coming from rooms that were non smoking.The window cleaners woke us up very early by their cleaning tools and ropes hitting our windows.
10,At first I really want to stay at the Luxor but it all went down hill when I got to my room. The A/C barely worked the shower I wouldn't even categorize as a shower. All around worst experience I had.
50,Great location very clean property really good food 24 Hour food options very soft bed friendly hotel staff cocktail servers very attentive and easy to find dealers very helpful and accommodating great comps
10,I had to change rooms on three occasions because of mechanical and plumbing issues. The view of debris on top of the hotel structures seen from the balconies is eyesores. Due to my expectations of MGM properties I would not recommend this hotel to family or friends.
10,If you like dealing with problems during your fun weekend stay at Luxor. Showers clog up no running water leaking sink no shower doors. Moving people to another room does not fix the issue. I have stayed in multiple hotels in Las vegas in over 20 years snd have never had as many issues as i have staying at Luxor.
30,The staff was very helpful and friendly. A+ for technology. MGM app for check in check out room keys and parking pass. Food at the coffee shop was mediocre but service was very good. Bodies exhibit was amazing. Property needs updating and pool is boring.
30,Our shower filled up faster than it drained I would have to turn the shower off wait a few minutes for it to drain and then start showering again. Housekeeping took all our towels (floor hand and face) and never replaced them we got new shower towels though
10,I cannot express how disappointed we were with our stay. Upon arrival Thursday the room we were assigned was still unclean and had dead bug splatter. The second room to which we were assigned had a dirty cleaning rag laying by the door the shower door was gross and we did not have wash cloths (even after our room cleaning none were left). There was a leak outside our door in the hallway and it smelled of mold in our new room. Parking was terrible… where we were directed to go was blocked off so we had to drive around finding another entry since we could rarely get ahold of a person to help. The TV stations were no longer available to watch after 1:30 am. With so many other options for staying e we will not be back nor suggest this resort to anyone.
40,Hotel is in good location. Room smells like marijuana. I wish they would be able to clean the room a little better. Besides that all was good. Great customer service by front desk. Real easy online check in process.
50,The pool was clean and very accommodating!! The room was very clean and bed was comfy !! Service was great !! Food in the hotel was great !! Over all it was a great experience!! If you plan on going to a Raiders game it is close to the stadium and a easy walk !!
10,The first room we got smelled so bad like tegan we thought was throw up but it turned out to be a very bad running toilet which ran all over the bathroom floor into the hotel room carpet. We were given a different room that ended up being INFESTED with bed bugs!! We took several pictures as well and management refused to resolve it by reimbursement of a simple $50 “resort” fee. I would not recommend this place to anyone as your health depends on it!
20,The rooms are bad water wasn't working AC in the other room did not work and Cabana chairs were broken too was at the front desk a lot of time and it was alot of time from the family doing stuff it was just bad time
10,The room didn't look like what was in the pictures. The room was really dirty. The bedsheets had dirt on it and didn't smell clean. The shower was all dirty and hasn't been clean in months. The staff didn't seem to care about how the room conditions were. Plus the staff never came to clean the sheets at all.
40,The suite was complimentary but the room needed serious renovation  Couch was out of the seventies  Shower floor had multiple cigarette burns and flooring needed to replaced  Front staff was friendly and accommodating.  Housekeeping gave us extra towels one day and took them the next day and didn't clean the room the 4th day
40,We got the best customer service from the Valet parking to the bell desk and m life staff. Everyone was very friendly. The staff made us feel very welcomed. The housekeeping were on point to our needs when we requested; anything we needed.
20,Check in difficult. They said 2 were on my res when 4 were booked. Wouldn’t give me the free roll away they said would be free. Now they they wanted to upcharge me. Had reservation wrong. Bell desk rude. Room dirty. Food wrappers under couch cushions. Light in room poor due to hotel design.  Slots don’t pay out. Disappointing all around
10,"Rented a 2 room suite. Website stated it was ""newly renovated"" called for early check in as well. Was told there would be no early check in which was the reason for my early flight. Had to wait until 3 which is standard but even then the second room was still not ready until 330. They couldn't even pull off standard check in. The newly renovated and pricey premium suite was disgusting. The furniture was old and stained. Stains all over the broken couch. Cigarette burns on the stools. Bar and table chairs looked worse than yard sale finds and were beat up worn and stained. There was a blue chaise in the bedroom that was so filthy it had a brown tint to it and i wouldnt even dare sit on it. On the morning of day 2 we lost all hot water. My wife had to shower on our second room. Later in the day the water came back very temporarily. On the second day we woke up to no hot water again. So I went to the desk and was told they had a hot water emergency and ran out. But if i ran the water I would be ok like I had not tried that before going to the lobby. They said they could send someone up but how could hot water be missing from just my room? I also took the time to discuss my displeasure with how old filthy and disgusting the ""newly renovated"" luxury suite was and was met with questions about why I waited to complain if it was so bad and that they could switch my rooms but they would not be connected and it would be after 3pm again so I walked away and just dealt with the room. I have never had a front desk agent who was so rude. I can say with 100% certainty that I will never stay at the luxor again and will think twice before considering any other mgm property. I realize the luxor is not the highest end resort but the room was unacceptable. I would not even expect this type of room for 19 bucks a night at circus circus. I would recommend any of you reading this get past the fact its a big pyramid and realize there are much better strip properties for the price. The pyramid gimmick is not enough to overcome rude staff and awful rooms."
10,Valet full self parking nightmare and elevator broken had to walk 5 flights of stairs with all of our luggage…couldnt locate our room after using self check in on the app and nobody around to ask for help. Then our room had no toilet paper
50,The little time I did spend in the room/hotel was great! I really enjoyed the Bodies museum within the hotel and plan to do the Titanic upon my next visit. I have 0 complaints about this hotel. I love the Luxor!
10,The customer service at this property is in need of a major overhaul. There were guest in line along with me complaining about a number of issues at this property. I got our rooms at a great rate and as they say...you get what you paid for. Extremely disappointing!!!
10,Horrible. Rooms were filthy. Elevators disgusting. Found roach in room. Do not stay here. Not worth it. Got a room with a hot tub but no hot water. Waste of money. Didn’t want to touch anything because it was disgusting. Do not stay at this hotel.
30,The morning of check out there was no hot water. I was told there was a problem with the city and I had to run the water for a while and it should get hot. Ran for 20 minutes and no hot water. Went home without a shower.
50,Luxor has always been one of our favorites their tower rooms are always a safe bet. We had a great experience and also got an early check in which was extremely convenient for us. Parking is a little tight sometimes but we didn't mind parking on the rooftop. Will come back!
20,This was my favorite value property on the strip for years but room remodels and disappointing shows and restaurant decisions have ruined it. The most recent room remodel took away the shower doors. You read that right there isn't a door on the shower so the bathroom floods if you take one. At first I thought it was just our room but no our friends room next door was the same.
10,Cockroaches in the room hallways rooms were dirty- even ground an earring and a sock in one outdated and unfriendly atmosphere. Public House restaurant had the RUDEST hostess slow service and cold food. Stay somewhere else.
50,Had a really good experience with everything from start to finish. It was great to services in the room very nice and clean. I would recommend this place in the future. Overall such a great experience.
10,We were looking forwarded to this and our rooms were horrible! We upgraded to the Elite room as it was supposed to have coffee service. The first room had no coffee maker and the safe was locked. The AC away not working well either we slept in a warm stuffy room and the beds were no better than a cot We set a time of 10:00am the next day to have security come to the room by 10:30 no one showed and we went downstairs. When we called downstairs we were on hold for at least 30 minutes.Waited in line for almost an hour had our room changed. The next room had a coffee maker and no coffee and the safe did not work either had a code on it I believe it was (6A H1) the same as the other room. We already wasted so much time dealing with room problems as we hardly get vacation so we decided instead of wasting even more time in line we would suck it and not have a safe or coffee THEN the last straw was coming back late and trying to take a shower and had to take a COLD Shower even tried the tub but NO HOT WATER not even warm water. The next morning the hot water came on. This was the worst place I have ever stayed. MGM should be ashamed!
50,We were very satisfied on your stays it’s our 3 rd stayed at the Luxor plus happy on staying there again oh definitely we would recommend it to everyone we know to stay there 2 thumps up and we love the slots machines from there
30,This is a nice hotel; centrally located and easy to navigate. It is not as large as the other resorts which is a huge bonus. The staff is friendly and the rooms are well kept. I would highly recommend it.
10,Staff was great but rooms are dated. My room was dirty and had to request another room. Second room had stains on sheets and had to call housekeeping to come change the sheets. Never again. Oh i forgot the $35/day resort fee they slipped on us on the last day.
40,Had a great experience staff was friendly & helpful rooms were always clean. The location is far from the main part of the strip so I recommend don’t stay there if it is your first time in Vegas. Overall I great hotel.
50,Having the App made the stay easy and quick! I paid on the app got my room key on the app and parking pass was also on the app! It also gave updates on the app when your room was ready! It really beats standing in line!!!
10,No housekeeping had to see them out in hall to get towels or call front desk. Never got housekeeping services for room. Do not plan on go there again. Casino slots were tight. The casino was clean. Machines wiped clean trash taken out and cigarette ashtrays were keep clean.
50,From the ease of check in to the courtesy shared by all the staff…..great stay! I could not have asked for a better hotel stay. Looking forward to going back in November to see America’s Got Talent live!
10,We got our first room that had cockroaches in it then got transferred into a room where tv never worked and they never came to fix it. We got transferred into a third room where it was absolutely dusty and filthy. An alarm went off at 3 am with no explanation.
30,The room was very nice except the tv didn’t work and the room would not get cold enough. Loved the casino and the restaurants. Great food. Loved the deals on drinks in the shops. When you buy 2 you get a shot
30,I don’t think they understand Covid is still rampant. I rarely saw anyone cleaning the machines and many people were walking past security without masks. I now have Covid symptoms after dodging it for a full year. Please boost your wipe down of the machines.
50,Clean large rooms and great staff. Would definitely stay again. Some amenities not available due to Covid but seemed to be more open than other casinos. Absolutely a great deal for the price. Diablo’s Cantina was a definite plus!
10,Please save your money and go somewhere else. This hotel is disgusting. The staff is not that great and getting the front desk on the phone when you have a problem with your room will take up to an hour.
40,Great property clean and relatively low key. It’s just a bit far from center strip. My wife and I don’t mind walking so it was great for us. It isn’t quite as hectic as some other casinos and the staff was great.
20,We have visited the Luxor on 3 occasions. The property seems on the decline. Things such as missing wallpaper broken tiles broken doors and stained furniture have been overlooked and not updated or fixed for extended period of time.
50,Everything was wonderful during our stay! From atmosphere to service to the casino itself. The only thing I didn’t like was how they tried to sell a timeshare and kept on until you gave in. They we located in a few places throughout the place.
20,Haven't been to Vegas in 5 yours Been to the Luxor Hotel before and loved it.  The Hotel and staff and all great Entertainment good.  Now the only bad part.....people are smoking Marijuana inside the casino outside the casino It was extremely unpleasant! I don't spend money on a flight good hotel room expensive food and entertainment to visit a ghetto atmosphere.  Walked into a few other Hotels and loved the PARK MGM it is a non-smoking hotel and it was so clean That is where I'll be staying next visit.  So sad because take out the Marijuana use and my rating of the Luxor is very good.
40,I love staying at the Luxor. I like the customer service and location. It was a sister's getaway. The other times it was family members. FYI you now have to pay for parking $15.00 per day. So if you go to another MGM property you can use your room key for parking as well.
30,Overall a fine stay and helpful customer service but a few things to warn about:  - Stayed in the tower and there's no mini-fridge in our room which seems primitive  - Couldn't find where to safely refill a water bottle. Most up-to-date buildings have water bottle refill stations nowadays  - Food at Backstage Deli was and I can't stress this enough worse than a soup kitchen. Felt horrible after eating it too but it was the only restaurant open at lunchtime which was disappointing
10,The bedrooms were HOTTT all the time I though maybe it was supposed to be like that but our friends room was nice. The people y’all hired to remodel the bathroom did a terrible job you should get your money back. The ice machines were all broken and you don’t have easy access to water…… speaking of water…. The showers were insanely cold. I got comped one day for that but that because I don’t like to make a scene. I stayed at the linq like 3 weeks ago and I will for sure be going back there. Luxor…… I’d rather stay at oyo.
10,1) The casino wreaks of cigarette smoke. Most of the other hotels I visited while there did NOT smell nearly as bad.  2) I woke up one morning at 430am to NO water at all  3) Finally got water at 530am but NO hot water  4) Came back about 530pm to NO hot water again  5) The bathroom shower just flooded the bathroom floor EVERY time I took a shower. What do you expect to happen with you don't have a shower door!!! It took 3 towels to dry the floor every day leaving a soupy mess of towels on the floor.  6) Rooms nearby smoking weed the whole time I was there.  7) NONE of your parking lot trash cans were emptied from Sunday to Thursday. ALL of them were overflowing with trash all over the ground. Disgusting.
10,We went in august and august is very hot in Las Vegas. The room AC could barely make the room 80° on high. When I called the front desk they said the ACs don’t blow very well and we were out of luck.
30,Luxor hotel and casino needs more excitement and taste. The casino needs more to capture the eye of its guests. They need to add something new that no other casino has to make them special. They need something that stands out
10,Never again I will stay at the Luxor rooms ca do not work properly hot water did not work ordered a mini fridge that did not work and all my food got spoiled had to purchase new food for there inconvenience
50,We had the best time from the moment we walked until the time we left! The best part of our days in Vegas were the times we returned back to the hotel at the end of the day after a long day of sight seeing and coming back to Luxor everyday was so amazing. Walking in the front door feels amazing and each day we were like we’re home!!! Great service amazing staff clean room and hotel!! Great views!! We joked that someone could come to Vegas and never leave the hotel and have an amazing trip! We love Luxor and will stay there every time we come to Vegas! We are big fans of Luxor!!!
30,We arrived with expectations but got a crappy room with an even crappier ac changed rooms to the new towers and was well worth it. Then we found out the check in lady messed up our rooms and we weren’t even suppose to be there in the first place so that was super disappointing but Jason the front desk guy made it worth to want to stay
40,I enjoyed this hotel. Would stay again. It's at the end of the strip. I didn't really have a great view. But it was good for my first Vegas trip!! Parking made me get in shape so make sure you wear good shoes!!🤣🤣🤣
10,horrible stay. i checked in and when i got to my room the shower was not draining after my shower the dirty water stayed. i called to get it fixed and they said it would be done within the hour. i left for 4 hours and when i came back it was still full of water. had to shower that way bacause i called them right when i got back in and they said they were sending someone right up. after an hour of waiting and NOTHING! i left for dinner and when i came back 2 hours lager it still was not fixed. i complained and finally got moved to another room
50,Had a wonderful stay at the Luxor Hotel & Casino. Great room with awesome view. Good food at the hotel. Quick check-in. Friendly helpful staff; hotel and casino. Easy access to strip and ground transportation. Loved my stay!
10,Luxor is subpar and was ghetto. Knowingly was put in a room without AC and reeked of marijuana in HALLS. I believe the room was in 25025. Consumers beware. Might as well sleep outside with the homeless and street girls.
40,We got a really good price on the room and we’re happy with everything except that it spelt like pot on the 3 floor every time we went up. It’s a cool hotel though. Average room but who sleeps in vegas
30,Room is clean and nice. Casino got all the games. Restaurants are decent. However the parking lot was far and very dirty. From the parking to the casino I saw many used masks thrown all over the places and trash. Parking lot is also a long walk to the casino. For a nice casino they can do a better job at keep the parking lot and common pathway cleaner.
30,Nothing very special stayed for a week had room issues from leaking ac that soaked the carpet and made room so humid it felt like we were in a Louisiana swamp while outside it was over 110°. It was bad at night and we complained got a different room with updated hvac. Just sucked getting all out luggage moved and we didn't get any comps for the issue.
30,Room was a nice size. Unfortunately the shower is unsafe as it has no railings and no door so the floor gets wet. No hot water on second day of stay until about 12 noon. Was told resort fees would be compensated and when I checked credit card statement there’s a duplicate charge of an amount more than what the fees were told to me at time of check in. Lastly it’s very inconvenient not to have a fridge or microwave in the room.
30,Property is OK. Definitely a budget friendly option compared to other choices on the strip. Lack of cell phone coverage was probably the biggest inconvenience. Few other issues were easily resolved by the front desk.
30,Decent stay until the end. I forgot my dimond earrings I called that night and no answer had to leave a message for lost and found. Got an email back saying couldn't find and nothing turned in. Over all decent hotel but cralpy about looking into lost belongings
10,The was a really bad experience from Day of arrival to the day I checked out. The rooms were not clean. The cleaning service would make one bed or the other. Never both beds. Mold was in the cracks of the time. Rooms not vacuumed. I can go on and on.
10,When we got to our first room it was dirty. I then went down to the front desk waited in line and complained. They said the room was never inspected so they moved us to a new room. The new room didn’t have air conditioning. So the next day we stood in line and complained again. The front desk said they would put in a maintenance ticket. 6 hours after they “fixed” it the room was still not cooling down. We again stood in line at the front desk to complain. They moved us to a third room which was nice. However I should not have had to spend that much of my vacation standing in line to complain and packing all of our belongings up to move rooms 3 times in 5 days. The staff was friendly but never apologized for the inconvenience.
30,Hotel was fun. Valet was a bit pricey but they were very efficient. One member of security seemed to single us out daily asking for IDs and hassling us on masks even when we were drinking our drinks. Requested an early check in for a pyramid room but none were clean and we had to stay in tower. Room was nice but never seemed to cool off. Other hotel staff were nice and the atmosphere was fun. Good value if you are on a budget
20,Rooms were very basic considering we booked suites. (Not even an actual closet!). It felt like they did everything they could to not interact with us. Huge lines to check in! We did not feel special at all considering it was our wedding weekend. (Nope! They never even asked!) Disappointing.
50,Room was more than I expected very spacious with great views. It was so quiet I never heard any noise from outside and the staff was very friendly. Will be booking here again since it’s walking distance from the strip and freeways
40,Room keys stopped working twice. Stains on carpet. Air conditioner was poor. Water smells like sewer. Needs upgraded. The price was affordable and the location was great. We requested a fan and they brought it up right away.
20,No fridge or microwave no more free drinks while your gambling at the bars just not the same place it used to be Buffett was closed they close simple access to pool or taxi or Uber just to have you walk through the casino and that sucks when you have blisters on your feet
50,I would 110% stay here again. Not a doubt in my mind this is the best hotel I’ve stayed at. Everything about it was great from the beautiful rooms to the amazingly nice staff. I would recommend to anyone to stay at the Luxor!
30,It was a weekend getaway with my family and to visit our family in Nevada. We were in the hotel for our rest time but the time we were there we always found something wrong and dirty. It was our first time in Vegas after 5 years of not seeing our family and our stay was not so pleasant
50,The staff throughout the Luxor property were mindful of mask mandate and were polite and respectful to guests in helping keep everyone safe. Masks and sanitizer were at every entrance and security and other casino staff had extra masks for people if theirs broke or left somewhere. Loved the trip and location.
40,The hotel staff was friendly and very helpful. We enjoyed the location how quiet it was compared to other hotels and it was clean! My one complaint was that our room was completely stripped of everything. There wasn’t a shower curtain so the bathroom floor got extremely wet there was no hooks in the bathroom for towels so we had to get new towels everyday no mini fridge or alarm clock or glasses.
40,We had actually stayed 3 nights in another hotel off the strip before upgrading to the Luxor (for a nicer pool). We were able to check in 2 hours early without paying extra through the app and we were able use the app to get into the room.    The few cons: our room was hot and the thermostat was broken and we couldn't make it cooler. It was 85 in our room.    Someone threw a poopy diaper in one of garbage cans by the elevators. It was not taken out for 3 days and smelled awful.    $15 for parking on top of the $39 per day resort fee was a bit excessive. Especially since the pool closes really early and at one point they closed all but 1 pool.
40,It was our wedding anniversary overall everything was great once we got the original room we booked in advance. It was easy to get to strip and made moving around easy. Staff was great one in particular Tyrone (security department) he gave so much insight to us which we met him on our last night and he really completed us with such a happy ending I am glad we were at the Luxor or we would have not had such a blessing from Tyrone which completed our Anniversary stay. Thank you Tyrone!!!!!!!!
50,Definitely the coolest hotel on the strip! You can always find your way back to it since it's got a powerful light on the top that projects at night. We will definitely come back to this property. How often do you get to stay in a pyramid.
10,Bathroom had pubic hair all over the tub bed sheets stained with blood dried up throw on the floor next to the bed which still smelled tv didn’t work pool very dirty hallways smelled like marijuana. Definitely was my worst experience ever at a hotel and ruined my whole vacation.
30,The hotel staff were friendly enough and one of the mLife attendants that helped me with my card was great. The casino floor was clean and the table staff was friendly and helpful. The worst part of the stay was the room which reeked of marijuana including some of the elevators. I would say the best bang for your buck if you don't mind the pot smell.
40,I would recommend Luxor to you if you want a variety of casinos nearby. Room wasn’t all that clean but it was ok. It’s nice to have received a hand sanitizer and a few masks in a bag. Lots of places to eat Starbucks walking distance to other casinos. The steakhouse was excellent and prices are reasonable. Good quality steak delicious bread great staff overall. Pyramid cafe is a must for breakfast or lunch endless mimosas are tasty. Can’t wait to visit again soon.
50,It was such a great experience. I love the staff and the cleanliness of the room. I enjoyed the atmosphere at the casino. It wasn't alot of smoke in the room that I was happy about. I love the food venues as well.
40,Needs to put full shower doors on shower and put a mini fridge in rooms. Room was nice. Great view of the Excalibur easy to get to the strip as well as Mandalay bay. Great food selection awesome pool.
30,There's no room service and housekeeping is inconsistent I only got my room cleaned twice in my 5 night stay. I have limited mobility and I couldn't walk the Property for meals and had to have a friend do that for me.
40,The Luxor is a prime example of you get what you pay for not too pricey and not too cheap. The hotel is centrally located between 2 other hotels and has easy access to bounce around on the strip. Only downfall of this last stay is that the air in the room wouldn’t get cool and the water in the shower kept getting the bathroom floor all wet. Other than those issues stay overall was awesome. Definitely have to go to Diablo Cantina worth the stay here alone. Until next time thanks Luxor
10,As soon as we got to are room it was dirty and the bath had hair in it and the room came with no toilet paper they switched Are room to a different room which was extremely hot so we got no sleep the front desk sent someone out to fix it but he did nothing we had heat exhaustion the whole trip worst experience i will not ever stay here again and we asked the cleaner if she can clean are room whule we are out she told us no
50,The room was pleasant and the hotel overall was great. We paid for early check in and late check out which made our stay worth it! I would have been disappointed if I spend more than $100 a night including fees and taxes though. Not worth much more than that.
30,"The rooms are pricy when you add the ""resort fee."" That fee includes the gym which few guests use toll-free calls which no one makes and basic internet which for one day is what I pay for a whole month at home."
40,As long as you stay in the east tower. The main tower is old and dirty. Staff was nice! The food in the food court was good. The rooms in the east tower were very clean! Location was amazing! Overall I would stay again.
20,Unknown charges on my card. Impossible to get a hold of Luxor hotel front desk for an explanation. I would like someone from the the hotel to give me a call and explain the charged amount as soon as possible.
20,Wow is all I can say the smell of marijuana like it was being pumped into the room thru the vents. Our room was only cleaned once and we were there for a week. Asking for towels was an act of Congress
20,Housekeeping did not clean our rooms but for one night. Towels had to be called for and left outside the door. PLUS housekeeping left their trash on our bathroom counter. AND we had left three items in the room called left message with Lost & Found No call back guess they kept those items.
40,For the price - it was lovely.. upon arriving we were able to check in early as well as get an upgrade to room. Staff was friendly and professional. There was an issue with one day not having hot water.. but that could have been bad timing or maybe even an issue with a pipe that was fixed ASAP! Overall it was a nice stay and we would return back again!
50,"First time at the Luxor. First time spending a week in Vegas not just ""driving through."" Staff at registration bell desk & spa were all professional helpful & patient. Enjoyed every meal at the Luxor. Restaurants are excellent & stuff are wonderful. And my massage was amazing!"
10,We came to Las Vegas to celebrate a birthday and her birthday was ruined. The First room we checked into was dirty so badly. Sheets had nasty stains in them shower had hair everywhere on the floor and toilet and shower just filthy nasty. No door on the shower caused water to flood the bathroom floor. Requested a new room after now being inconvenienced. Had to pack up all our belongings to make a room change. Because of this we missed our dinner reservations since we had to repack and move to a new room. Get to new room and ac was barley working and again tv didnt work. Called about the tv not working at 4:30 and again at 5 and again at 7 and still nobody even came after the last call the guest service worker said she was sending somebody up nobody came. We left the hotel and came back at 12:30am and still tv was not working. Called and they said all maintenance where attending a water leak that happened Couldn’t even enjoy the amenities of watching tv in our room. Called and spoke to a manager and he put us in a updated room but yet we where inconvienced to have to pack up everything in the middle of the night to get to a whole new room again. TVs in this room still didn’t work but at this point we where done complaining. On top of that there was no hot water the next morning and no notice or call to inform us. Had to wait to use hot water later that day for a shower. Just a horrible experience at Luxor and a lot of wasted time back and forth. Horrible wifi connections through the whole casino and in the rooms. We where compensated $100 food credit but it doesn’t make up for the inconvenienced we had to go through just to have a nice stay in Vegas and enjoy my partners birthday trip.
40,This was my second time staying at the Luxor. I appreciate the fun design of the property and its location to other properties I enjoy. It is also conveniently located near the airport and attractions such as the wonderful Titanic exhibit the interesting Bodies exhibit and the fun Blue Man Group show. The rooms are clean and quiet but could use updating with the addition of fridges microwaves and coffeemakers. Other than these missing amenities it is a decent value. Also my son especially loved the pools - which provided a great respite from the heat.
10,The room had broken AC (it was still over 85 degrees in the room with the AC on full blast) and it took 2 days for them to fix then the hot water went out. Extra shaky elevators peeling wall paper and cracked walls just topped off the skeevy hotel experience. We had a king room on the 30th floor - it should have beem AMAZING but it was awful.
20,No hot water one day. The king corner room I had was dated was missing furniture and the what was there is dated and worn. The TV was missing the remote and reception was fuzzy. Best they can do is remove one day resort fee. Will not stay here again.
30,The guestrooms need to be updated. They are old and we stayed in a premium king suite which i was told was a more updated room type. The staff was nice. There were lots of entertainment options and they are close to everything on the strip.
10,Old everything. Many other options within the Mlife group to stay at. Don't stay at the luxor.  There are zero amenities in the room. No mini fridge no single cup coffee maker no nothing. If you are looking for a nice room and nice place to stay don't go to the Luxor.
20,The Luxor as always provides good prices for its location. However the resort is beginning to show its age. My room did not have a coffee machine or mini fridge. Worst of all the room’s AC unit did not work properly. Housekeeping sent an engineer but they could not fix it. As a result I had no choice but to stay in an uncomfortably hot room for 5 nights.
10,Sink water was not going at all on the first day. I had to call maintenance and waste about 2hr behind that.  Shower water was not going had to call maintenance and waste my 2hr behind that as they arrived to fix after 6hrs of reporting.  Shower water was coming out all the time. The door of the shower was only half. Had to put 3 to 4 big towels to avoid water spilling water in whole restroom area.  One day even after 2 reminders the room was not cleaned.  Elevators were so far half way of the pyramid building from the room.  We could smell cigarettes smoke most of the time even our room was non smoking. May be some rooms were smoking on that floor?  Overall Response was too slow unfortunately. This was our 1st Stay at Luxor and the experience was bad. I would not stay there again.
30,First time staying here at Luxor. Got free room so tried it out. Very crowded. You have to pay for parking. Ridiculous situation. Took us 30 min to find a parking spot. No cool. The place is huge and confusing. So many different elevators to choose from. Rooms are nice though. Starbucks stays crowded and closes early. Blizz makes good waffles that's a plus. Didn't get to try any restaurants or the pool this trip
50,I simply enjoyed my stay at the Luxor. This has always been my hotel of choice. It was within walking distance from the convention site. Great spot with so much inside to offer it’s guest. The staff was very friendly and the check in process was effortless! Thx
30,Was booked here for a Conference. 4 nights.  Cons: Check in line was long and the desk clerk did not seem to know what she was doing had to go to a manager for every question on check in. Room was nice but no fridge (Covid maybe?) no one explained the window light film protector was peeling and ripped in spots. While the film is there to protect you you can hardly see out of them because of the angle of the film on the window. Bed was comfortable TV worked just fine. There was a bag of dirty linens sitting in the hallway when i checked in it was still there when I left. The first day I arrived some woman returning from the pool decided to put her Childs stinky soiled wet swim up diaper into the garbage receptacle by the elevators it stayed in there for three days before someone cam to empty the trash. Stunk up the whole hallway. The elevators (they travel sideways up the pyramid) were filthy with open and missing panels. The buttons for the floors did not stay lit when pressed it was hit and miss. Had to change elevators many times. (annoying) While the experience of traveling sideways is cool you would never know this because there is no view from them.  Pros: Restaurants were great even fast food options were plentiful and well priced. There is a short walkway that takes you to the Shops at Mandalay Bay or on the other side of the resort you can take a moveable walkway to Excalibur across the highway.  Staff was constantly cleaning machines seats and surfaces plenty of free masks and sanitizer stations throughout the resort. The pool area was huge and well kept by a young staff.
10,We had so many issues with our room and none of them were addressed despite numerous conversations with the front desk staff and front desk managers.  The room stunk of sewage and did the whole time of our stay.  The bathroom sink was clogged and despite front desk telling us someone would come to fix it they never did.  The sink remained clogged the entire 8 days and was a pain in the ass to use every day.  There were ants in the bathroom even though we were on the 18th floor.  Again this was promised to be addressed - it wasn't.  They promised to move us to another room but I when I went down to get the keys I was told it was no longer available.  The whole stay was a joke.  Hallways filled with Marijuana smells.  The Luxor used to be a nice place to stay and I've been a client of theirs for 25 years.  How sad you've let your customer service and standards slip so badly.
50,My only issue was Lodi g my cellphone. When I asked a waitress if she’d seen it. She said she did and should’ve picked it up but didn’t. This would’ve saved me $900 to replace it and having to cancel a credit card.
30,They need refrigerators the maid service came very late almost every day (7pm one day) they turned off hot water for maintenance one morning and the A/C did not function properly. Finally the reservation prices did not reflect there would be a $40 resort fee.
40,Luxor Hotel and Resort is in the right location to get around. It is conveniently located near a Walgreens eating places and places to shop. I would recommend this hotel to friends and family. I loved the newly remodeled rooms.
50,I love everything about the Luxor I pool area is also very relaxing except for some of the food and Starbucks closing to early I still love the environment at the Luxor. Check in and out was very easy
40,Very good customer service and knowledgeable. They followed all COVID-19 registrations. The pyramid cafe is very good try the chicken and waffles and go see the carrot top show it is very entertaining.
20,Hotel is in need of many repairs. took two days to get us a room that was under 80%. Casino through is spot on. Just dont expect much and you will nit be disappointed. I know we spent 5-7 hours in line to fix our room. Also nobody answers phone at the front desk. like I said casino  great but the hotel Is rigjt up there with motel 6
50,My husband and I went to Vegas for an annual vacation! We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. The staff was very helpful especially the sports book! Would highly recommend staying at the Luxor! The location was on the strip located near many other restaurants and activities.
40,I used my M-life rewards to get comped for 4 nights plus a cheap one day. The mobile check-in was no easy as was using the app to open my room door. The room was clean when I arrived. Only issue for my room was the toilet was consistently running. The casino did have some cigarettes smoke but it wasn't to bad. I was offered drinks from the cocktail waitresses but never got anything. The casino portion itself was smaller than you would think based on the size of the building. They did have a lot of variety of games but not everything you'd expect (they did have an Alien slot machine). The parking garage was easy to get in and out of. The casino was easy to get to other casinos as well.
20,Room was dirty when I received it. Clogged tub. The next morning when I left until 2:30 and returned my room had been cleaned. When I asked the cleaning lady she had an attitude with us. We thought she was there because my girlfriend called the front desk to tell them our room hadn’t been touched
50,Rooms and facilities we're wonderful! Room was so so great! Housekeeping and other staff were amazingly helpful and friendly! Easy and fast check in and out with the mgm app! We had a stroller and a wheelchair and navigating the property was smooth sailing! Loved our stay! Highly recommend!
40,Our family’s go to spot on the strip. Conveniently located just close enough to experience the fun of Vegas with out the wild party atmosphere at the center. Ride the tram city bus or walk to nearby destinations.
30,The hotel had plenty of great things. The staff is amazing and accommodating. The casino floor is well kept. The room however are lacking. AC socks and if your allergic to pet dander like myself be prepared to ask to switch rooms. The rooms are generally well kept but you can tell there is no deep cleaning happening.
30,I had to change rooms due to a leaky ac unit moldy shower head and a broken tv. Make sure you inspect your room before you get settled in. Watchout for ants. The staff werr friendly and professional.
40,Check in went well and was fast and efficient. Request a complimentary upgrade and was accommodated the valet and bell service was tops. Bellman took the time to get ice which was all the way at the end of the hallway. Only complaint is the rooms at the Luxor are old and in need of some TLC and refurbishment. GreT stay.
50,Everywhere was always so clean. Staff was very courteous and friendly always helpful. Room was a good size and exceptionally clean. There were plenty of places to eat with a wide variety of food to choose from.
50,We had a really short stay but if my kids remember the hotel room that’s all so if think about going to Vegas look at Luxor first!! You won’t regret it good service and is convenient we would definitely go back again soon!!
30,Hot room no room service bad cocktail service dirty room too far from strip pool closes early and mixes adults with families. No shuttle to airport or the strip had to walk through many hallways and elevators to get a cup of coffee in the morning. No way to keep items cold in room extra charge for refrigerator and it takes forever for it to be delivered and then for it to get cool
50,I enjoyed my stay at the Luxor staff was great . I also enjoyed the pool and mini gym.Great value not breaking the bank . I will definitely be coming back to the Luxor my next trip to Las Vegas . Will be back next month
10,Last minute reservation…would not book again. The hotel has cool features but it smells stale. The rooms need to be upgraded especially the bathrooms. My first room didn’t have ac. The second room was not clean had stained linen. 3rd room sink was slow to drain.
50,Overall it is very nice and staff is friendly and professional. I would have liked to stay at the Pyramid rather than the towers. Hope to return in a couple of months for my retirement party. 21 years in corrections yes this is my paradise.
30,The Luxor is not a bad place to stay but the rooms are showing their age. the AC is okay but there is no thermostat just a hot cold dial and 3 levels of fan. The strangest thing is that there are no towel racks in the bathroom to hang a hand towel or bath towel. The water pressure was great! but the drain had issues so the shower pan would fill with water. There is also no door on the shower or curtain just a wall half way then an opening.
10,After staying here I wouldn’t even send my ex wife to this place. It’s so old and run down and only half the elevators worked. Plus room was dirty and the housekeeping was sub par. The electrical outlets didn’t all work. No USB ports to use chargers it’s ((2021)) not 1999 come on people this place needs an entire overhaul or demo.
50,Absolutely great as always no complaints except on first time staying in the pyramid and the elevators were very slow 10 to 15 minutes wait time other then that no other issues staff was exceptional as always
20,Probably are affordable.  No conditioner is offered at this hotel.  Hotel pool is 3 feet tall.    The bed also did not feel too comfortable if you know what a sofa bed feels like just imagine that.    Did I mention there is no conditioner... lol
20,Uncomfortable old spring style beds outdated gloomy decor missing coffee maker cups and condiments out of service vending without refund no room service and no advance notice of lacking room service.
30,Hotel had some great shops but not all the desks were open and I never saw anyone who worked for the hotel except house keeping. The rooms are pretty outdated and it was sorta crazy not to have a fridge for drinks especially in the Vegas heat. Overall the room was a good place to sleep and it was easy to be picked up by Uber and activity shuttles.
50,Very comfortable Easy Access Great Staff throughout the entire resort. Staff was very nice at the Pyramid Cafe. Front desk staff very courteous. Tickets and staff at Titanic and bodies was very nice. Great price for 3 nights
30,Lower rating due to elevators not all working. Housekeeping need to make sure clean glasses are placed. TV’s in room need upgrade snowy picture. Other than that staff was friendly and pool was nice.
20,It was meh just meh. Elevators were broken check-in staff were rude. It seems like all the amenities are gone no more refrigerators or coffee pots. The games in the casino were dirty and it was hard to get a drink.  Housekeeping was great and the room was clean.
10,Issues with checking in via mobile check-in we were only able to check in to one of our room which was booked at the same time time as the other one we weren't able to check in to. We had to go to guest services to check in to our other room and the guy was giving us a hard time because the chip of my card wasn't working we tried sliding it and using tap with no avail. The desk guy told me there was nothing he could do that I would have to use another card and after going back and forth with him he typed in my card number and it worked.    The desk guy apologized and stated that he was upgrading us to a room with a view but when we got to the room it was the exact same type of room we had booked and it wasn't a view of the strip but I guess he wasn't specific regarding what type of view so whatever but the room was dirty the carpet was stained and burned from an iron. Dust was on the vents the floor in the bathroom looked unclean and rust was on the shower door. We requested to have the room vacuumed but it only seemed to make the carpet look worse than it already was. We were so tired from the drive that we decided to just let it go and try to make the best of the rest of our trip. I would not recommend anyone staying at Luxor. We had a 3:00 PM check out time and housekeeping woke us up at 9:00 AM 11:00 AM and came back at 1:30 PM she knocked and came into the room we were occupying even after being told that we were scheduled to check out at 3:00 PM. We have stayed at Luxor several times before and we enjoyed our stay all the other times but this time definitely stood out and we will not be returning as a guest ever.
50,We had a terrific experience with everybody at Luxor most notably the guys that were working the valet parking. They were sensational.    The people at the front desk were great to work with and the little convenience store there next to the Bell station had a terrific assortment of stuff that we needed. We knew it was going to be expensive but after all this is Vegas!
10,WHEN YOU HAVE A DISABLED GUEST WITH A WALKING CANE THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE TO STAND IN LINE FOR ALMOST 1.5HRS TO CHECK IN WITH A REAL EMPLOYEE.    I requested a handicap accessible room. I was told it was. IT WASN'T and when I tried to get 1 I was told sold out. I wouldn't have booked with luxor. Would of stayed at a Caesar's property. All three drains the sink with shower the tub drain all drained very very slowly one in the sink in the bathroom literally you wash your hands it takes almost 16mins for it to drain out. When guests have a DISABLED PARKING PERMIT THEY SHOULD RECEIVE FREE OR a good DISCOUNT ON VALET PARKING. THE POOLS SHOULD BE OPEN LATER THEN 7PM. THAT'S WAY TOO EARLY TO CLOSE THE POOLS.
50,We had an awesome time at the Luxor... again. Even with all the craziness of the pandemic we had a great time staying at the Luxor. Even though we had a few problems during our stay the staff rose to the occasion and took over all of our problems. Would recommend to all my friends and family.
10,My partner has MS and for longer walking periods requires a wheelchair. She rented a power wheelchair from a company that was almost half an hour late dropping it off because even though we were told it would be at the Uber pickup the driver had to drop it off and the Excalibur and wheel it over the bridge to the Luxor per the hotel policy. This is a violation of the ADA and if you have any mobility issues whatsoever between the shower with no door making the bathroom floor dangerous and the wheelchair drop off issues do not stay at the Luxor.
30,Only 2 elevators were working out of 4. Had to wait an unusually long time for an elevator to get to room. Depending on the time of day there were over 10 people waiting for 1 elevator. Many guests were discouraged with the wait times.
40,My husband and I stayed here this past weekend. Our first room was in the tower and the toilet leaked. We called the front desk and was moved right away to a pyramid room. Glad we switched made the stay much more unique in the pyramid. The elevator to the room was an experience in itself. Although it is an older hotel and does need some updating nothing kept me from having a good time. My only complaint would be the shower had half a door so water did run over the bathroom floor so be careful. All the workers and restaurant staff were excellent. Would recommend this hotel
10,Hair was found in the shower and towels. Front desk confirmed that resort fee will be waived since it was booked with Hyatt points but we were billed with resort fee later. Will definitely not stay here again
30,the overall experience was mediocre. The employees was awesome. I am upset about my room because water overflowing onto the floor as I took a shower… My key didn’t work like it supposed to. The high limit room was closed so it forced me to play uncomfortable amount of money in front a crowd … No room service after a certain time also no rewards for spending over 7k at your hotel during my stay…
50,The updated room (pyramid king suite) was great. It is a solid affordable spot to stay on the strip. The room was spacious quiet and very comfortable. I plan to book again next time I'm in town. I've stayed at a variety of hotels on the strip over the years and Luxor does not disappoint I recommend it to my friends and family planning to visit.
10,The room was not available that our reservation was made for at 11:00 p.m. I was offered an upgrade which it was not. The room smelled of mildew. The carpet was wet. I stepped on it not knowing what it was. It was disgusting. The view was non existent at least give me a view of the desert I had a rooftop vent view.
20,East tower needs ATTENTION ON WATER.. JACK BURDG KNOWS . I showed him videos and everything about my stay. Ask jack BURDG ABOUT EAST SIDE PIPES. I was transfer in 2 rooms in East side and both were terrible UNTILL was moved in west side tower. West side tower water was good. Other than that EAST SODE TOWER NEEDS ATTENTION!!
50,My husband and I celebrated 31 yrs of marriage. Due to COVID 19 we werent able to celebrate our 30th anniversary last year in Vegas. Its nice to be able to visit other casinos without having to go outside.
50,Spent 4 days here for a birthday celebration and enjoyed every minute. Had a updated queen pyramid room. Great view quiet very comfy beds and cleanliness was superb! Food court (Johnny Rockets) is great—milkshakes. YUM🙂
30,When we got in to the hotel we were early. We were only going to try and check in our bags but fortunately for us the room was available and was able to check in earlier with no additional fees and was able to get my sister into the room next to me. The downfall was that the AC was not working well at all and given how hot it is in July we were not happy with this. They were able to provide a fan but I felt that the rooms should have been cold with just the AC unit. Overall it was not too bad of an experience.
30,Room had dirty sheets with yellow colored stains on them. Dirty towel with hair on it. Tub had hair in it. It seemed like it wasn’t properly cleaned. The night stand had rings on it from where someone’s drinks were obviously that wasn’t even wiped off or cleaned in general. I was very disappointed because I really liked the atmosphere of Luxor. First time staying at Luxor and probably the last.
10,Horrible stay. Bad rooms (both) rooms were terrible. I only had my room cleaned once and I was there for four days. And I had to catch the housekeeper in the hallway to ask for bath towels and maintenance
20,We spent 4 nights here and everyday there was a new issue that made us not want to come back. I wouldn’t recommend this hotel save your money for something better. Our room was double booked and we had someone try to enter our room at night if it weren’t for the deadbolt they would have entered and thank goodness we were inside otherwise all our belongings were up for grabs. It was much more of a headache to stay here instead of being able to relax and enjoy our vacation.
40,Chose the Luxor because it’s near the stadium. I had a good stay glad I chose the hotel. First time going to the stadium and it was definitely walking distance. I went with friends. I would not recommend the hotel for a romantic getaway as the rooms need updates.
30,The only main issue I had was no late night food especially after a big event at Allegiant stadium but this seems common in most hotels. Another issue was the shower doors in the bathroom. It was half a door and the water splashed out of the shower.
30,The room was ok. The air-conditioning system was from before the remodeling. It was bad and should be replaced. The hot water did not support the amount the number of rooms. We ran out of hot water very quickly and did left us wanting
40,Beautiful hotel/casino which is a unique feat of engineering genius but needs a little Botox and face lifting to the hotel rooms. It’s clean and comfortable but needs some updating and tender loving care even with the remodel. I blame the CEO and the corporate heads and invite them to spend a few nights in one of their stand rooms to get this drift. Other than this the hotel is a mature and grand lady so take care of her. She is part of the classic Las Vegas landscape.
30,A place that costs so much should have more amenities better beds and a more modern look to it. It screams 2001. Not only was the room completely different from the photos but for a room that didn’t even provide a microwave or fridge it was extremely over priced. Even charged me full rate and not military for the last day’s stay. So for a total of about $900 I pretty much got what you could get on a military installation except the added room service. The resort fee was a little excessive per night but I figured I’d give it a shot. The casino was drab and well some of the bartenders wouldn’t even address me. Literally talked right over me and went to take multiple orders before even asking me. At that point I was going to spend my money elsewhere. The only saving Grace was LUSH. Grand experience and the sweetest staff. Checkin process was excessively long lucked up and got a nice lady to help though. Took an hour in line and another 30 minutes at the counter. Maybe in a few years the hotel will change for the better hopefully sooner…but until then I’ll be staying where I get way more bang for my buck.
20,The hotel is beautiful not enough customer service the bed is hard as a rock you are charged to use the computer you must request housekeeping the room is hard to cool it's one of the hottest hotels as far as heat.
40,Very comfortable spacious and clean room. Check in was fast and we were guided to the elevators. Decoration and services very nice however it was always crowded. We noticed a strong weed smell in several areas of the hotel. The gym is small but enough to work out. The swimming pool very clean and spacious. Slot machines area is very dark but entertaining.
10,Luxor is lying online and when you get there it's worse. False advertising. Don't waste your time. I will spend my money at Pechanga. Pechanga is clean and they don't lie. Go to Pechanga in California instead.
50,The stay was pleasant very clean and friendly staff . I plan to come back soon it’s was my first time staying at the Luxor but not my last. The only thing I was sad about was that the Luxor buffet was close and we had to walk over to the neighbor casino to eat at there buffet
20,They could do better there customers service is trash everyone was nasty attitude in willing to help … not the cleanest not worth the $$$ I pad motel would’ve been better tried to speak with management no luck
10,Dirty no towels shampoo soap. Had to call and request clean towels every day. No charging ports electrical outlets actually pushed into the wall when you tried to plug anything into them. The “Stay Well” system was a joke. The wall unit didn’t work in either of our rooms and was clogged with dirt. No hair dryer no coffee pot no microwave no mini fridge. Out of 4 elevators only 1 was operational consistently through out our stay. 30 minute wait to get to or from our floor to the lobby. Overall a complete waste of money.
30,Thought it would be a little nicer for the money we spent. The staff was good the music the DJ played was awesome. The walk from the elevator was horrible. No coffee or vending machines on our floor or ice machine.
20,Our AC was leaking.    We received room service 2 times and our pup mysteriously got ticks. We didn't receive room service one day due to waking up late and that night she didn't get a tick on her body. (Ticks tend to carry their host's blood after being in the host for an hour). We squished the tick and it didn't have any blood so it barely latches on. We arrived in our room around 9-10pm. I just find it odd where when we didn't get room service our pup didn't have a tick on her body at the end of the night.    Also a man who worked at the hotel kept insisting that I needed room service @11pm and kept asking to speak to me because my fiance answered the door. I was already in bed. But the man kept insisting on speaking to me which freaked us out.
20,Horrible bathroom odor the shower drain took forever for the water to get through AC barely kept the room cool through the night. Also no fridge to store food and drinks! We never got maintenance to come to our room to fix the bathroom leak our room had.
30,Outdated room excessively priced for no amenities and the thermostat was no help. Vegas is hot. Please know that 72 is not a good temperature. Why is it not at 68? Also if I’m paying military rate it should apply to every night I stay. Not just a couple. Price online was totally different from what I was charged.
20,Traveled this weekend to Luxor to catch the Mexico USA game. Checked in Fri July 30. Checked out Monday Aug 2. Overall room was clean. AC was a bit weird as it said 65 but felt like 75. Room view was not great. Paid for Tower Premium King. View was not premium. View of street intersection. East Tower Floor 1 Room 305. Worst part of stay was food. Atrocious wait times for food. At Luxor food court. 45 min wait at Nathans. When I got to front and I asked manager Jenn why she was training a cashier on the weekend with that many people in line she said I did not have to eat there and could stay at Circus Circus next time. Think I might just do that. Buffet was closed. Paradise Cafe wait was 1 hour. Not a fun trip in that aspect. Next time will stay somewhere farther up the strip.
30,B1 elevators only had 2 elevators working sometimes it was even just 1 working which caused multiple people to pack in 1 elevator like sardines because they didn’t want to wait. The elevators were scary to ride because they were really shaky.
10,If this was my first trip to Vegas I may have seriously considered never coming back. From a dirty hotel room on day one to a total lack of awareness and reaction to customer need my honeymoon was unfortunately one to forget with the exception of the pool area.
50,staff was amazing  rooms were clean  we stay at the luxor every year and continue to plan to  we realize it is on the far end of the strip and thats a problem for a lot of people but this does keep it a little more quiet witch is a huge plus for us
10,The stay at Luxor was the worst. Concierge never amswered. The water stopped working. We paid for a parking pass that never worked. The staff also walked into our hotel room with the privacy card on the door. 0/10
40,The Luxor was a nice mix of the Vegas life with a bit more seclusion. Since it is towards the ends of the strip there were not too many people around which I enjoyed. There are also a good selection of table games and slots to play.
50,The Luxor staff made us feel at home. Everyone we encountered during our stay was pleasant and helpful. The Hotel made sure to provide mask and working hand sanitizer machines. We felt safe and comfortable. The location was just right for us close enough to the action but calm atmosphere when its time for bed.
40,This was a fun experience for both me and my cousin as first timers in Vegas. The elevator was unique compared to other hotels we stayed in. We will surely check-in again and will also reccomend to our friends and other family/ relatives.
10,Don't expect the truth or any kind of responsibility if you have been misled or asked for accurate information. The staff in charge of reservations and check in were inclined to only lie more and avoid any effort to correct the situation.
10,This place was horrible stayed 2 nights had 2 different rooms both horrible. 5139 broken ac 4104 dirty room crumbs hair on shower walls and interrupting maid that stares at naked body. Pic is area outside my room. If you can stay anywhere but here do it. While service was decent the rooms are despicable I had 2 and the other couples we were with were not all that pleased with their rooms but were scared to change in fear they would get worst. One of the couples had room with low functioning ac that did not cool room so they literally slept in chairs by ac to not sweat through night. I had housekeeper burst in on us completely naked even with me yelling do not come in we are in here. The toilet in 4104 constantly ran almost made think would flood. The ac units in both the rooms I had looked like units from a pay by the hour motel or an old econo lodge tan old rusted with 2 knobs to adjust fan speed and temperature by warm cool colder no thermostat at all. Floor 5 had bags of dirty linens for the first 24 hours we were there all up and down hallway. Right outside my room was small hallway full of trash that was never picked up or cleaned. When I complained at front desk on Friday night the lady was nonchalant and seemed to careless. On Saturday at checkout the lady that assisted me refunded the late checkout fee and apologized. So needless to say service was touch and go. The best part of our stay was the frozen drinks and the bartenders there were very nice. But this place definitely was not worth the money we spent. I will never go back and if anyone ask I will tell them to run another direction.
10,My hotel room door would not lock. I expressed this to the hotel staff and they said they would come and fix the issue. They never came. Every time I went to my room my door was unlocked. Very unsafe and for the price I am very dissatisfied.
10,Room was initially not very clean with visible hair around the bathtub. Was not remedied until requested cleaning service late at night. Minor requests (extra pillow) took over an hour and multiple calls to get a response. Check in takes a long time. Service is very slow and impersonal. Room rate and location was okay. Had a few issues with reservation that could not be remedied online and spent a long time on the phone just to get a person.
10,Worst trip to Las Vegas we have ever experienced. Our room was disgusting. We went to the pool one morning to come back to a dead battery in our door lock. I explained to the front desk our lock wasn’t working. Multiple trips up and down to the lobby. Took over 3hrs to get it fixed. We had no food or money because I only took my ID and room key to the pool. We spent half the day waiting on the floor of our room waiting for the fix. Moved to other rooms with additional problems. DO NOT STAY HERE!
50,This resort was very nice. I had worried since the price for the stay was cheaper than other hotels on the strip but the hotel was very clean and the staff was very friendly. We stayed in the pyramid premier king room and it was amazing. The room was completely updated and was way bigger than some of the other hotels that we have stayed at on the strip. The casino was nice and was connected to Mandalay Bay and Excalibur.
10,Don’t waste your money or time here! Horrible property with a lot of problems and major concerns! Wouldn’t be surprised if they get closed down in the next year or two! The property is falling apart dirty and stinks like sewage POT and cigarettes in the rooms. Almost all elevators in the towers were down. All food options were bad except pyramid cafe. None of the others were open until later and closed early. We had one bad experience at pyramid cafe and one decent experience at the cafe. Tender the steak house is a massive waste of money and you will be extremely disappointed and pissed that you wasted your hard earned cash. It is not top notch it was actually the worst meal I’ve ever had and that’s not an exaggeration!! Do yourself a favor and book at the Bellagio. Prime the steak house there is expensive but at least you get your money’s worth and the food is excellent! STAY AWAY SAVE YOUR MONEY FOR SOMEWHERE ELSE!
40,Room was nice. Especially for the price. Spent time at the pool. Wish the pool area had more to offer. Pools on the far side seemed to be closed for no reason. When booking the cabana website said adults only. Kids were everywhere.
30,Room was old. Needs to be updated. No wifi. Wasn’t clean when we checked in. Pool was nice. Cabana staff was excellent. Cafe closes too early probably covid. All the slots are new and confusing to play.
40,It’s a very nice hotel nice clean rooms and friendly staff. My only issue is their elevators breaking down a lot. Over all it was a nice experience. It’s pretty far away from all the action of the strip so prepare to do some walking.
10,Very dirty and ugly hotel. This place has really gone down hill. Rooms were nasty and the halls were nasty. We use to enjoy this property but we will have to sadly let it go. This property needs a complete 360
40,This place is amazing. The minute you walk in your breath it takin away. Great amenities casino is live and happening great staff and one of the best thing is your right on the strip. We ate at 2 of the restaurants and the food was grade A
20,The walk from the parking garage to the room is a nightmare. Takes 15 minutes one way. The timing can be worse on weekends especially with the elevator.  Watch out for extra charges likes a parking fee and resort fee.
40,My overall trip was very pleasant. The service was outstanding. The room though basic fit my needs. It was clean and everything in the room worked. I would love to have had a late check but wasnt quoted the right price. Overall would stay again
20,Rooms felt outdated and in in need of a good cleaning. Hallways were messy as well. Casino was ok. Parking was easily accessible . Titanic exhibit was very interesting and educational. Bodies exhibit was also educational.
20,After two GREAT experiences with Luxor in the past this stay was the textbook example of how to LOOSE CUSTOMERS. Unfriendly staff with lots of attitude rooms were not well cleaned guest services would not answer phones. Escalators and walkways broken/non-functional shops closed. Smell of Marijuana everywhere - even in hotel rooms where there is SUPPOSED to be no smoking. Lots more issues. This was memorable for all the WRONG reasons.
50,I can’t believe after a couple of decades I had never stayed at the Luxor. Earlier this year we booked a few nights there and are now hooked. Excellent staff and service great gaming great food and nice rooms. I would recommend anyone wanting a complete casino Vegas experience to try the Luxor.
30,Check-in was a nightmare. Room was comfy but outdated. Staff was very nice and helpful. Not enough gambling tables were open. Less than half were open and every one was packed. Not enough food choices available.
10,At 9:30 prior to checking out the safe deposit box was dead so i called front desk explaining my situation they said they will send someone to open the safe and till 12:00 no one came even though i kept on calling every 10 minutes. I even spoke to a manger explaining i have a flight to catch would they please treat the matter with some urgency and unfortuntly they did not claiming facilities has a list and i have been added into there list.
10,We checked out of Delano and switched to the Luxor because we had reservations for the Blue Man Group as a surprise for our son. We paid additional for and early check-in the room assigned was #5140.    There were two broken elevators and very confusing to look for directional signs and decipher the numbers and letters as to which elevator we needed to take.    Our room was directly behind the Sphinx out front with the pyramid. There was a place where a mini fridge used to be but now it was just straps and wires. The a/c was a little 3x14” vent on the far left corner of the room. It was so hot in there felt like it wasn’t even blowing. The dials here set to high and cold but the 1.5hrs we were gone nothing changed. I called and asked to be checked out and refunded and was told I’d have to change rooms first. They “upgraded” us to a tower room. So we packed up and had to go back down to the casino level and find the East Tower elevators and we’re assigned #6162. When you exited the elevator you were hit with a wall of weed smoke and had to go around 3x to our hallway. The wallpaper was peeled and taped in place. The floors had stains and looked like they’d never been moped or cleaned from this year. Our room was the same and the bathroom had visible bodily fluid stains all over. Absolutely disgusting!!    Thank God for Jack Front Desk Supervisor who heard our complaints and granted us to be checked out without penalty so we could pay the additional $50/nt and return to the Delano. You’re an angel thank you!!!    I don’t recommend this resort to anyone. Absolutely not what we expected.
30,I used to consider the Luxor as one of the nicer places but time has caught up. They need to renovate the rooms and do some maintenance. No coffee pot in room. No fridge in room. Not hot water in the morning on my last day. Floor I was on smelled and the had a fan running in the hall all night I assume trying to dry the floor. Not as good as it once was.
20,Came with husband and grandson and stayed for a week. Room was clean. Bed was decently comfortable although the pillows were lumpy. Had to call for housekeeping multiple times to empty trash and send new towels as they just stopped cleaning our room midweek. The room was uncomfortably hot all week regardless of what temperature we set the thermostat. We had to wait 5 to 10 minutes every time for an elevator to the 27th floor. With those issues and the fifteen bucks a day to park overall this was not an impressive place to stay.
50,The upgrades are beautiful including the new restaurants. It was very clean with no odors. We enjoyed the pool and spa. Everything is pretty much a one stop shop with food shops shows and fun all in one location.
10,Where to start… My room smelled like cigarettes. I got charged for phone call housekeeping made not out to someone else but to the house keeping office WTF! Then when checking out I need a print out for the four rooms I rented. There was no check out line so being military I stood in the military line for 30 minutes. Once arriving at the counter I was greeted by Filipe who told me “you can’t read I guess this line in for VIP check in go stand in that line!” I explain the both lines say checking neither say checkout. He then told me “sounds like a you problem that you can take up once you get to the front of that line” I then asked to speak to a supervisor and his response was “yes you can ask to speak to a supervisor in the other line” I refused to leave until a supervisor came to talk me he berated me a little more before finally get a supervisor. The supervisor was helpful with my checkout be refused to let me lodge a complaint against Felip
10,Room was dirty upon check in and the toilet didn't work. The room we were transferred to was much cleaner but the air-conditioning was horrible had a hard time sleeping because the room was to hot. Paid for parking with was 15 a day and everytime I would try to use the card to exit it wouldn't work requiring customer service assistance which is accessed by pushing a button on the exit machine. It takes them forever to answer and until they do you have no choice but to hold up traffic as there's no other way out. Ate in the pyramid Cafe the food was average. Overall bad experience. Better to spend the money for the better hotels!
10,"If I could give this hotel zero stars I would. Trust me there are other hotels in a similar price range ... stay at those! This place is disgusting and run down.  Here are some issues we had while staying there :  - Told the hotel had ""run out of pillows"" when trying to request more since there was three in our room and all where flat and old.  - What appeared to be feces in the hallway by the elevator.  - Wifi does not work consistently.  - Shower would not drain properly causing water to back up and overflow onto bathroom floor.  - A/C despite being on high the entire time did not cool our room.  - Dirty towels left outside rooms in hallway as the Luxor says to do this to request new towels.  - Dirty diapers left hotel hallway.  - Fixtures and buttons that looked like they had not been wiped down in several years. Not only is this disgusting but with Covid it is dangerous.  - Rude cocktail waitresses ... if you can even find one.  - Literally almost every single employee was dismal and looked like they absolutely disliked their job. It was depressing."
30,Short staffed a little dirty and smelly. NO late night food anywhere close to the property. If you want a basic getaway it’s fine. Pay for chairs or cabana at the pool prepare to wait A LONG time for a drink and in between drinks
10,It was a terrible experience. Could not get the air conditioner to work properly. Water all over the bathroom floor. Went to eat at the cafe was told I could not unless I registered online even though we were standing there waiting to be seated. I will never stay at Luxor again.
20,The hotel has a lot to offer with great exhibits/shows and restaurants. However the rooms are horrible and the staff doesn't care about your bad experience. If you are told you're being upgraded to a tower room it is not an upgrade just decline it and keep the pyramid room as they are updated.
30,The room I reserved was not given to me on the mobile app so I had to see the front desk to fix the error. Then the room AC was not working properly so I was assigned another room again. Casino host was not friendly.
50,Stayed at The Luxor for a night it had been 10 years since I’d last been to Vegas. The hotel staff was very friendly facilities were very clean and mobile app checkin/checkout process easy!  Since you have to pay for parking anyway consider paying for valet. You can’t leave and re-enter when using the self parking. Other than that A+
50,Trip was awesome from reservations to Valet. Jaz from the reservation booked 2 rooms for us reserved a cabana and tixs to the Jabberwokies. Rooms big and clean for 3 adults. Lots to do. Poolside food was great tasting! Will return in September
40,Nice hotel the room is a little unimpressive view but overall clean beds and working bathrooms. The rooms got a bit hot at night and hard to reach front desk.Pool was nice and there were plenty of restaraunt options in the casino. It would be nice to have more seating areas.
30,updated rooms leave alot to be desired but the rooms are better than they used to be. too many small inconveniences like slow and packed elevators no buffet weak room A/C no/limited housekeeping. but pool was very nice warm water and plenty of seating. saw Carrot Top show which was excellent.
20,I would not recommend the Luxor to anyone mainly because when I first got to Vegas It was advertised to me that the Luxor was on the strip.. it indeed was not. Then when I got to the hotels and received my room on the 9th floor my room was not clean and the tub had water in it. That’s ridiculous for a room I paid $280 for the rate including resort fees. From there since no one at the front desk answered the phone after holding for 20 minutes I had to bring all of my stuff back down stairs to get another room with not even as much as a sorry. Not to mention the room was not worth the rate. I could not use the tub in the new room because it didn’t look like it had been cleaned but I was not walking back down stairs. There is was no refrigerator in the room which is crazy to me because the standard Hilton has a refrigerator. Just kind of sub par for something marketed to be so exquisite. Not to let room there are homeless people sleeping in the lobbies when you come in at night. Better security would be nice. The only non stressful part of my birthday trip at the Luxor was check out
10,Too disgusted with the place to dwell on it but suffice to say we will never stay here again. Frankly questioning all MGM hotels at this point. The place is absolutely filthy rude staff and overpriced is just the tip of the iceberg
50,Luxor has gotten better after Covid. We had a 2 queen suite in the pyramid and even though it was not one of the renovated suites it was very nice. Huge bathtub comfortable beds excellent housekeeping very nice.
20,The room was run down dirty air didn’t work and we found a roach in it. We were moved in our last night but I believe we should have. Even comped a night since it was disgusting on our first night
10,The first room I got was in the area where there was a breaking and the door was off the hinges they said that there was remodeling going on but the second room I got to was dirty there was spots on the carpet and customer service front of the front desk and the builders was horrible and I had to pay for it. My kids gotten sick had to go to the hospital the first night. Wasn’t there most of the stay was in the hospital
50,We have stayed at the Luxor three times now and some of our favorite memories have come here. From the pool to the casino and the food we really love staying at the Luxor. The staff was amazing on this trip and was beyond helpful. Looking forward to our next stay here.
40,Good - atmosphere price  Bad - pool dirty one day no fridge or coffee maker in rooms lots of walking due to location on the end of the strip.  Overall average stay. Would stay somewhere else next time but glad to have experienced this hotel once
20,Honestly the location isn’t the best you have to walk quite a bit to get to the main area of the strip. Our first room reales of mildew because our AC was leaking. It was as if no one checked before hand. Then the new room they gave us was on a floor where the elevator call buttons didn’t work so we would be waiting 10-15 minutes for an elevator and when to buttons did work we’d have to call for the elevator to go up to be able to get and elevator and then hope for it togo back. I had very little interaction with the employees but the couple I did they weren’t very nice. Don’t waste your time at the pyramid cafe they have. The food was over priced not good and our server was kind of rude. It’s sad because I used to state there when I was younger and it was great but now it just sucks. Would not recommend to anyone.
30,Nice pools showers clean rooms valet service is fast and worth the extra $15 to get it. The only negative thing I can say is the mattress was lumpy and felt broken. You'd think with all the money they make they would buy some new mattresses.
40,I enjoyed staying at the Luxor I like how convenient it is to walk to the Mandalay Bay and the Excalibur Hotels without going outside.  The casino bar turns into a club there is plenty of restaurants.
30,Travelled with family and dog. We were put on the 3rd floor and had a pool view. For reasons unknown WiFi in the room was basically nonexistent. For a $35 resort fee you would think that they would make sure that there are no dead areas for WiFi coverage. Yeah OK so WiFi is only part of what is included in the resort fee but it’s the most important piece next to the pool. And who uses the gym anyway? Just saying…
40,Went to Vegas to celebrate my friend's 50th birthday. Another hotel messed up our reservations but the Luxor came through. Had a wonderful stay there!! The only problem were the elevators. They could use a upgrade.
30,I saw a great contrast when I walked from the Luxor across the little Shoppes at Mandalay Bay into the Mandalay Bay Hotel. The Luxor was dark while the Mandalay Bay was bright and cheery. It was a stark contrast. The entire stay at Luxor I thought they needed to turn the lights up. Maybe some people like that but it was depressing to me.
40,Been going to Las Vegas for over 25 years. Very happy  with the sleep quality of the beds lack of noise and the location  of the Luxor. Staff was helpful and the casino was comfortable.  The location was convenient to most of the strip with the use of free trams.
10,It was a long walk to check in and then a super long wait my wife had fell earlier in the day and was dripping blood down her legs for some reason my id won’t register and so I can’t just do mobile check in after waiting a long time in line with my wife we finally got someone to help us the guy was rude and when he asked for an id he said he couldn’t take a picture he needed the real I’d we explained that my wife was bleeding and we just needed to drop our stuff real quick and go to get the id from the car the guy didn’t care and said he absolutely needed the ID and there was nothing he could do so I had to walk a quarter mile again to my car to get my ID once I did get my ID I went back to the same guy and showed him my ID and then he told me that because I used myVEGAS credits I couldn’t check in my wife was explaining to him how that doesn’t make sense because we already checked in the same way at three other hotels and was fine he snapped and just brought the manager we explained to the manager the situation and he said he would help us once we got to the part when we had to pay we came across another issue the deposit for the room was more than what we were told on the mobile app we explained to him that we only had $10 less than what was stated and that we didn’t know and if we did we would have put more money on the card we told him we had it cash and could pay it all cash but he didn’t care and said there was nothing that he could do so I once more had to walk all the way to my car take a nap and then figure out how to get the money. Then once I got to the room the table was dirty and I had to call to get it cleaned and there was no wash cloths. The walk to get out of the room was always excessively long and the vending machines barely had drinks in them or they just didn’t work. And some lady tried to walk in my room without even knocking or warning me. One of the rudest and least helpful hotels I have ever been too.
40,Overall this was a good trip. The suite was nice no microwave. The hotel carpets should be cleaned they smelled of mildew. Too many minor’s in casino area. Food was a bit expensive. Hotel was a little further than expected from Vegas strip
10,The rooms were dirty and outdated. The toilet in our room was not in working order. Not sure why they would assign a room without a working toilet and when we called them they stated they would do it as a courtesy. Shouldn’t they be considerate of their guests? I also paid for daily parking and our key would not work throughout our entire stay. The key was even changed and we continued to have the same problem. Very frustrating considering we had difficulty parking at other MGM properties.
10,I have to share my roach with roaches very disappointed  I always stay at the Luxor when I visit Vegas ( twice this year) but that will change in the future. I’m very disappointed of how cleanliness of the place is going . I chose Luxor for years because I like the ambiance. But no more
20,Upon arriving on 7/19/2021 I was told my hold fee was $200 and not $100 as explained to me when I made my reservation. Rooms reaked of cigarettes and were not properly setup to welcome me let alone any guests.
10,"For those that don't know the Luxor is the pyramid on the strip in Vegas. We stayed here for our trip which was four nights. I told the front desk twice that our ac in the room was not working and the floor was wet in front of the ac unit. And then I told the front desk manager and he said he would ""put a rush on it."" Their ""solution"" was to try and move us to a different room. We chose not to move because honestly we didn't want to be in a worse situation than we already were.  There is no microwave no coffee pot or refrigerators in the rooms. And you get the coffe pot in the suites. You can get a refrigerator for an additional $25. After I found that out I didn't even ask about a microwave. For this hotel to be on the ""resort"" level (because you have to pay resort fees) I don't suggest staying here. It's a cool hotel to visit because of all the Egyptian decorations just don't stay here for your trip."
20,This review is just for the room itself. It looks like they haven't kept up the rooms. We stayed in one of the suites. Drapes were stained and dusty. We were afraid to touch them and get dust all over our faces. Furniture was worn and the corner of it had wood exposed and was a safety issue. Upon arrival the floors were not vacuumed or didn't do a very good job of vacuuming There were coins on the floor.    However I overlooked all that because their employees were nice and friendly no issue there. But I don't think we will be returning considering there are so many other options in Las Vegas.
10,Was checked into a dirty room with dirty sheets pillow cases. When called to fix put on a dirty bed spread.At 230 AM got moved to a new room to hotel staff over an hour. Cake stained the hallway. Disgusting
40,Great hotel great price and easy check in when you use the mobile check in on your phone. Super easy you must download the Mlife rewards app and become a member. Now to the bad if you park in the self parking there’s a tunnel you have to walk through to get to the hotel so expect to get bombarded by pot smoke! I got no problem with pot just personally I hate the smell and don’t think anyone else especially kids should have to breath it
30,Leaky room when it rained some staff were nice compared to others. At the end of the night they told us we would be moved. Before we were moved the the leaking was never fix or attempted to be fix I will be going back September I we’ll summit another review hopefully next it’s better
10,The rooms were dirty the toilet didn’t flush and the sink didn’t drain properly. I changed rooms and the second room was not satisfactory either. The air conditioning didn’t even work in the first room!
30,We stayed here one night and it was good for just that. Previous reviews complain about the AC in the units and they are absolutely right it does not work well in the room. I'm someone who is always cold and even I got pretty warm the AC does turn on but it does not keep the room cool especially in 100 degree weather. It was also disappointing to not have a microwave and fridge.    The good things about this hotel is the staff is friendly the pool is really nice and there are good food options. We ate in the Public House and really liked it.    Overall we probably won't stay here again unless they did some renovations it has potential to be a great resort
30,Overall view is beautiful and staff was great. We stayed in the newly renovated rooms and it was not what was advertised in the pictures. It was much darker in person and still needed some work as well as the elevators to the rooms. There could also be more housekeeping in general areas of the halls and by the pool
10,So many broken things in the hotel. Most importantly the escalators and walking escalators did not work. We took our parents who have trouble getting around and it was not easy. Rooms are not as nice as they advertise at all.
20,AC was not strong enough to cool room especially when its over a 100 degrees out side. Also the property looked a bit rundow and i do understand it's over 25 years old. The walls are very thin could hear people talking in the next room.
30,There was no fridge or microwave in the room. No windows just glass which made the outside look darker than it actually was. They only had free wifi - not secured. No refill water station and a regular bottle of water was $4. And of course I was charged $40 a night in unspecified resorts fees for something I probably didn't even use.
20,I went to vegas with two friends one of whom is in a wheelchair. She called in advance about an accessible suite and told that they don't have any. I don't mean they weren't available they do not *exist.* When she asked what *was* available that was accessible they had Tower rooms which is fine. She specifically asked if there was a bathtub in the accessible rooms and was specifically told that they do. We discussed some other hotel options as well decided on the luxor and when she called to book the reservation she double checked again that the accessible rooms have a bathtub. This employee also said yes the accessible rooms have a tub. Her husband arrived before us and guess what? No tub. He spoke to the front desk the one and ONLY type of accessible room available exclusively has a crappy shower with no door (just an awkward length curtain.) In my room the plug for the sink wasn't attacked to the mechanism that lifts and lowers it it was broken. There was filthy water in the bottom of the shower there were exactly two bath towels and nothing else (no hand towels no wash clothes no bath mats on the incredibly smooth/slippery floor). The bedsheets are scratchy and the room smells faintly of marijuana (though there's only so much they can do after some jackass smokes in the room). I will not be staying here again.
30,The hotel and casino itself is nice. However the rooms were well below my expectations. We had gotten a 2 queen bedroom at the tower and there was no mini fridge no coffee maker no room service and the lighting in our room was very dull. Since the hotel was at the end of the strip it was always a long walk and the heat made it even worse. The bus stop was about a 10 minute walk and in triple digit weather it was suffocating. Overall I was pretty disappointed in our room but I will say the beds were very soft and pillows were super fluffy even though there were only 2 pillows on each bed.
30,I’ve stayed here two or three years ago and was amazing…. This time was gross and kinda ruined my family vacation. I would think that more of the pool would be open carpets could be cleaned and the elevators smell like puke.
50,Perfect for my kids first time their!  Family trip!  Perfect location on the strip!  Many things right their in same area to do instead of having to walk far.  Cafe has amazing food!  Even with some covid regulations it was perfect visit!!! See Luxor again in Nov!
30,Mlife room promotion wasn’t the one I signed up for. Friendly staff but not willing to make sure that my issue was resolved or to offer me any alternatives. Tried to call mlife and was on hold for over an hour with no answer.
20,Multiple problems with stay. We were in Vegas for a stay to play basketball tournament. We were told that laundry service was available and provided a laundry ticket. When we went to turn our uniforms in for cleaning we were told that the 3rd party vendor emailed the week before stating they would not longer be providing service to the hotel. This was almost midnight and we weren't offered any options of where to go to take care of getting the uniforms cleaned for games the next morning. Overall our stay was less than enjoyable. We were not able to use the pool since they close it at 7 and we had games during the day and we still had to pay a $35+ resort fee daily and I see no benefit of the money spent for that. We will definitely be looking for other accommodations on our next visit to Vegas.
30,Bathroom shower didn’t have a door so water would go everywhere. Even after putting towels down the floor was soaked. Someone can very easily slip fall and get hurt. Also there was dry wall coming off the ceiling and then it was all over the dresser
30,Not so great of an experience. Most definitely going to check out the other casinos. I spent way to much to not receive any free play. Had 1 awful waitress and also a great one. Service desk did not help me at all.
30,Room is pretty basic needs updates. Like that it had Starbucks on site. Dinner places were not open due to covid. Room service not available. Had to call three times to get towels. Wish there was a shuttle to the airport.
10,Got charged to much the room stank  the tv didn’t work . I called room service 3 hours later they still didn’t show up I had to go back down to complain for them not to be able to explain why what was even going on
40,Nice hotel. Rooms are a little dated but overall good experience. A/C didn't cool off the room very well. Staff was very friendly. It was nice that the hotel was attached to Mandalay Bay and Excalibor hotels.
50,My wife and I stayed in the east tower while my daughters stayed in the pyramid. Both rooms were clean cool quiet and comfortable. The only downsides were the buffet being still closed and the pool closing pretty early at 6PM.
20,This hotel is not clean and smells of smoke even in the rooms because of the design of the building. Check in took over an hour the staff doesn’t seem to be in a hurry at all. Restaurant service was slow food could be better. Overall I wasn’t not impressed.
30,Was not impressed there was no room service when you tried to get the front desk you would be on hold for hours. Was not impressed with the shower as well. There needs to be better organizational structure and if needs be do not try to sell tourists products.
30,For the price you pay you would think you would be able to check in in less than an hour and that your shower wouldn't flood the bathroom floor. The A/C units are sub par at best and you have no control of thermostat. Cleaning staff is amazing though!
30,Air barely worked in room rest of the facility casino extra was very cool. Mattresses could use some updating. Shower drain was clogged. Dog crapped all through the halls and lobby. Was marked off and being cleaned.
50,We really enjoyed our room and the service. We particularly enjoyed our room in the Pyramid as opposed to the tower…very convenient. Reception checkin was seamless and the service staff were all exceptional!
50,An incredible design with an amazing decor. A very lively atmosphere with a huge variety of entertainment. I was impressed that Luxor was connected to the Mandalay Bay as well as the Excalibur. This feature tripled the amount of shops and restaurants to enjoy.
20,Im just gonna say there was hair in the shower after i asked several times for them to remove it. other than that my stay was great i always stay at the luxor. this 200 word min is crazy what if i didnt have 200 words to say
30,The hotel does not make the beds or provide any towel service on a three night stay. They also only had one person getting drinks at the casino. We had to purchase drinks while elsewhere and bring them back.
40,Our stay was July 23 thru the 26. And my wife was having a great time she was a little disappointed because Bruno Mars canceled but our Host took care of us and we appreciate her very very much. Thank you Dor’ee.
50,Arriving at the Luxor we were amazed. Very beautiful! When me and my sister arrived we was amazed! Room was really nice. View of the Allegiant stadium!! Beautiful. Customer service was awesome! Very happy with our trip!
10,Don’t come here if you want any type of quality service. I received better at a red roof inn. Unclean sheets run down hotel no room service no coffee maker no fridge no access to a microwave rowdy guests
30,Stayed on 22nd floor. Extremely long wait for elevator. Also had to go up in order y one down. Poor air circulation in common areas. Hallways dark. Many bulbs out. Poor water pressure. Requested different room. Heard nothing.
30,I’ll preface this review by saying I have managed hotels and resorts my most recent position was an AGM during the height of the pandemic. I understand staffing issues and the massive stress the pandemic has caused. Terrible guests asking for the impossible during a pandemic are the reason I left Hospitality for good.    But the housekeeping at this property left much to be desired. The room wasn’t cleaned all the way and the common areas had as much litter as the strip itself. It’s not hard to get elevator landings and hallways vacuumed even with a reduced staff. I wouldn’t have called this hotel clean even to 3 star standards. I expected much more for the reputation and location of this resort.
10,We only booked a night in this hotel because we got to Vegas around 1am and there was nothing available. We got our room only to find big trash bags right outside our room with used towels and trash right outside our room and we saw more trash bags like this outside other rooms down the hall.
40,I was having an excellent time with the bookstore until I had a problem with a credit card or decline security became rude and aggressive and even reached my room because I did not want to walk to the hotel with them. I called the front desk to ask for a courtesy which they granted but De de wanted to be top-flight security. Thank god cooler heads prevailed and the hotel manager was able to calm down the situation but I still want a room comp for a few days
30,This is definitely a budget hotel. If you want to save money it is an okay place to stay but the rooms do show a lot of wear and need some maintenance. The app does not work as expected and there is a long line to check in if you are not able to get the app to work.
10,When we got to the room we noticed that it wasn’t completely clean like it should be when I ask for towels it took two hours then it took another two hours because I called Management to ask for towels also there was a roach in the room when I called the front desk and spoke with Christina she hung up in my face like I was trash this experience at the Luxor was terrible I did not expect this from a hotel that has been seasoned in hotel and guest hospitality for years I was very disappointed
50,The room was up to date and clean. Only thing that was bothersome were the dirty drinking glasses. Other than that the stay was lovely. Be warned if you are staying in East Tower there is a long walk from the parking garage. Not the most convenient after an exhausting day.
30,Check in was horrible jack the supervisor needs more training on customer service . Jack said he will call when our room was ready that it would be ready at 4:30 well we didn’t get to check in at 10:30
20,Multiple casino bathroom issues and was evicted today by the front desk manager. There are grasping and protocol issues. They didn't was to treat me as a guest as a mlife member...    I am complaining to corporate.
20,My restroom had alot of little bugs flying around i told one of the girls cleaning and id they had this problem going on for quite some time and well they didnt do anything about it i was very disappointed
10,I confirmed with their rep. over the phone that my emotional service dog won’t get charged for stay. (An hour and half wait time to talk to someone). End up had to pay for it at front desk check in. Manager with REALLY professional poker face give me discount on it seem he does this all the time. Got cheated.
10,Simply put this property is in need of a remodel and the rooms are disgusting. The elevators all have wires that are a hazard with no covers. The worst is that they state $35 daily resort fee and its actually $50 including the $15 parking fee. That's $50 daily fee on top of your daily rate. Did I mention the floors in all hallways are disgusting? Seriously to enjoy a nice weekend spend your money elsewhere. Trust me
30,A bit outdated room. No bathtub. Very noisy air conditioner. Very noisy bathroom ventilation. Interesting property design and layout. Good choice of slot machines table games other options to bet. Average choice of food.
10,Unfortunately this was the worst place to stay in Vegas.I wouldn't come back again unless I received a refund.Not worth the money I spent in their hotel.I chose to go and play at the Mandalay Bay instead of the Luxir.
50,I really like the Luxor. Beautiful hotel. Will try to come back next year for vacation but i will get a scooter chair next time because there is a lot of walking in the hotel and the strip. Enjoyed my stay!!!
50,Very clean no issues whatsoever happy customer great environment kid friendly clean room parking is accesible took the measurements for sanitizing!! Affordable would definitely book another trip kids loved the environment good restaurants food as well
40,This was a beautiful hotel. I really loved the egyptian art and statues. The atmosphere was lovely and the staff was very friendly. The hotel is connected to two other hotels which was a plus. The only thing that I didn't like was that the pool closed at 7pm every night.
50,We have always enjoyed our stay here. Wish they cared for this amazing building more. Maybe upgrade the pool area. There definitely are fancier/newer buildings in this town but they’re not the LUXOR. ❤️  We definitely will return.  Troy and Mary.
30,The hotel was amazing; however the rooms are outdated. Tv was very old scratches all over the furniture and the phone inside the room was horrible! Could barely hear the front desk lady speak. Parking is also a nightmare as well so plan ahead for that because it took us about 30 mins to figure out. The hotel is amazing on the inside just wished the rooms were as amazing and kept up like the main part of the hotel is.
10,The Luxor is in need of extreme renovations. The parking situation is terrible!! It is way too far from the check in desk. It’s very hard to find parking and there are tons of drug addicts lurking in the parking lot. I did not feel safe. Bed was extremely uncomfortable. The AC system was not great. There were very few food options. Not many amenities at all!! The deposit takes 7-10 business days to be refunded. I wouldn’t even stay there if it were free!
20,Cheap stay but bugs in room and rude staff also staff unable to assist you and no ac in the hallways which is ridiculous considering Vegas weather I’d suggest going somewhere else and save yourself the headache drinks weren’t correct either
20,The room had no refrigerator microwave and calcium built up in the shower and sink. The extra resort fee was also ridiculous considering not everyone uses the pool and gym room. The fees overall are ridiculous.
30,I did not interact with any of the staff since I checked in on the App. Also my shower drain was backed up so I was standing in a puddle of gross water. The carpets in room 21100 were stained and dirty. I walked in my sandals the entire time.
10,The website said newly renovated pyramid room. The air conditioning leaked on the floor the music started thumping early in the morning which could be heard from our 4th-floor room. The European shower leaked water on the floor. We needed extra towels just to mop up the floor. On the first day we asked the housekeeper for towels and she gave us one towel and one washcloth. Thankfully a different housekeeper on the next day gave us two so we could keep ahead of the water on the floor from the shower. On a good note the M Rewards people were so nice as well as the front desk at check out. The exceptional service was the spa.
50,The property is beautiful nicely set up beautiful scenery wonderful staff great food a lot of things to do. We would definitely stay again and recommend family and friends to stay as well. Thinking of bringing my mom for her birthday.
20,Not worth the hassle. Book elsewhere on the strip. Very disappointed from the start so we left a day early. Didn’t even bother with asking for a refund for the last night it was easier to eat the money and leave the Luxor.
10,Service was horrible everyone was rude there was a problem with my room door and I couldn’t get in for like an hour! I lost my reservation dinner at Bellagio because of that. I will not return to this casino!
20,If you don’t mind having a dirty room broken ice makers and having to hit the up button on the elevator just to get one to go anywhere because all three of the down buttons were inop for several days this place is for you !
40,My girlfriend and I just took a couple days away from in-laws and kids to getaway and enjoyed our stay except for our room air conditioner was not cooling our room at all so sleeping was not as comfortable at it could’ve been. Maybe consider replacing or upgrading the units little by little floor by floor so your guests have a good relaxing time in and out of the room! Thank you have a wonderful day!!    Jonathan H.
10,I have purchased the 3pm late check out service and by 11:20am a wanna be coo security knocked on my door and ask me what time am I’m leaving? Her tone of voice and her attitude made my daughter and I felt like we were nuisance or homeless people that wondered in and refuse to go! I swear if the security were a guy I would have punch him out
10,Don't waist your time staying at Luxor they have ants they don't clear your room when you stay more than 3 days took 4 hours 3 phone calls later for clean towels! No microwave or refrigerator in your room so why is there a RESORT FEE FOR BAD SERVICE
20,"MGM obviously does not value this property and is unwilling to invest in basic maintenance. 10 years ago this was a much nicer hotel. The gaming floor is just as tired as the rooms and infrastructure. They have dimmed the lighting to try and hide the shabby but it's not fooling anyone.    I wasn't going to write a review but they forced me to write one then tried to get me ""skip this step"" after I wrote it when they spotted 2 stars."
10,Not the best stay . Indoor safe super hidden . Usually in the closet on the dresser drawer. Didn’t find till after I checked out . Night stands drawer the right one . No fridge  can’t connect your third party device like Apple TV or fire stick. Entertainment center ports didn’t work
30,We git the tower room which i thought were newer but the appearance didn’t give me that vibe. The rooms were not that advanced and looked normal ( not like 4 star) looked like a motel room.  However we spent the day in the pool which was well spent.
30,The Luxor is a decent hotel. It’s very cheap but you get what you pay for. Housekeeping only came one time in our four day trip so we had no fresh towels. The design of the shower is very poor and with no door the shower floods the bathroom almost immediately. The AC stayed on high for the entire four day trip and the room stayed blazing hot.
20,Not enough food available after 8. Could not get any one to answer the phone when calling the front desk to request towels. Spent several hundred dollars gambling never received not one free drink. Was not what I expected!
50,The elevators are a different experience the pool was great the bed was comfortable. I have stayed at several resorts in Vegas and this resort is comparable to the others. The pricing was nice and I was given free parking at all MGM resorts during my stay. Nice perk there since I had a rental vehicle. All of the staff I encountered was very nice. Will stay here again in the future.
50,Excellent service..room was great was very clean and actually smelled nice..when we checked in our room wasnt ready so they gave us an option on rooms..donna at the front desk was very patient with us and very attentive
30,I stayed at the Luxor for my friends birthday and we walked in to a very hot room. So we went to the AC and it said it was on so we waited a little and began sweating so we called front desk and no answer after 20 minutes so I walk down and she was very rude because of how busy it was. Said she would send someone up but it never happened. So we didn’t get any sleep. The next day I go back down and ask for assistance on the ac and she said she would send someone still nothing happened. Then we went down again and the lady was very rude so we gave up.
20,Our room was in the pyramid and it was horrible this is our second time staying at the luxor. But this place was clearly a one and done. Our room was so hot we call maintenance to fix it they came the next day the excuse on why it took so long was that we get the calls in the order that we receive. The maintenance man was unable to make our room cooler so he sent up a fan The fan made a loud unbearable noise when plugged in and cut on we just suffered in the heat the remainder of the stay. Our sink and our shower was clogged every time we took a shower it felt like we were taking a bath in the standup shower. This second stay was horrible.
10,As a Mlife member Room a/c wasn't working properly and it was hot and warm during our hotel stay. It was disappointing. We came in a huge group paid the room separately but yet our room wasn't the same as the others. Toilet paper wasn't stock around the a/c unit has damped with wet floor with a wet floor smell. The fact that the room experience was horrible the charge for the parking was even worse to add onto this experience.    RESOLUTION: Hot weather improve the a/c unit and do what you can at least for the guest especially during this hot weather during my whole stay for 4 days 3 nights
40,as always there are things that people in wheelchairs will need to look out for. So if you are in wheelchair then you know what to look out for. Please check you room/bathroom as I had problem with mine.
10,This hotel was dirty the inclinators do operate efficiently and the hotel rooms were also dirty and very hot. Additionally the staff was not overly helpful nor concerned about our experience. We will not stay in this hotel again.
10,I reserved a to Queen premium corner suite to celebrate my oldest son turning 21 and my youngest son turning 18 it was our 1st experience in Vegas as I had never been as well hour flight arrived at midnight I confirmed with the front desk months prior to us leaving that we would have a late arrival so our Room would be secure they assured me that they had documented it accordingly I also called several hours prior to or flight leaving to again confirm we were a late arrival we got to the hotel around 1:00 a.m. and after standing in line for over an hour to be checked in was told they did not have our Room the desk clerk offered to down grade my reservation to a standard 2 Queen Room with out any further compensation I declined the desk manager only offer for compensation was to waive our resort fees. The room he then offered was a suite similar to the one I reserved but it only had 1 king bed. With 3 adults in our party that left my 2 sons to sleep on the floor. I told him we would need 2 rollaway beds. He refused stating policy of 1 rollaway per room. After much arguing the facts he finally agreed to 2 rollaway beds and also gave us a $200 food and beverage credit. Once we finally arrived at the room it took another 90+ minutes to get the rollaway beds. I'll never stay there and hope no one else ever goes through that experience.

40,For the 'city that never sleeps' the food (especially on weeknights) closed too early for us. Almost everything closed at 10pm and most people in vegas are still up and moving walking around at that time. We had to uber a pizza because there was NOTHING to eat that was relatively close.
10,The room smelled like mildew. The air conditioner was broken. The AC drain must have been clogged because the carpet was completely soaked within 6 feet of the AC unit. I reported it and no one ever came up to fix it. I was there for six days. Housekeeping only cleaned the room twice. When I called to ask for fresh towels they dropped off a trash bag of towels. The other days I had to walk around looking for a Housekeeping cart to steal clean towels every day.
10,Casino took my winnings changed color of 777 dirty room the city is cool but hotel was dissatisfied wouldn’t stay or recommend will tell others my experience was not as expected and don’t play slots because I was ripped off
50,The staff was very friendly and helpful. The room had a tub which was perfect for me because it was tiring walking the strip so relaxing at the hotel was a must. Loved the pool and the Egyptian theme.
40,The Luxor does need an update however our room was nice and cleaned everyday well . The whole hotel casino was very clean the staff friendly and helpful . The location is rough as it’s on of the closest to the very south end of the trip . Overall we like the Luxor as I’ve stayed there over the years many times
50,We enjoyed our three night stay. Rooms are a little dated but while we were there they had signs all over that they are in the process of renovating. Our bed was extremely comfortable and no complaints in regards to the stay. Highly recommend Diablos in the atrium.
10,Hotel is outdated from head to toe but the real issue I had was with getting a room with a very poor a/c unit. I wish I had gone with a more expensive place for the cost was the only thing nice about this place.
10,No resolution during our 5 day 4 night stay. a/c barely worked our room was muggy & warm. Elevator on our floor didn't work buttons wouldn't even light up. Had to used stairs. Advised the front desk but nothing was done during our stay. We were just advised that they're working on it.
10,This hotel was filthy rooms are outdated unless your in the tower rooms.. Air pods went missing after cleaning service.. Had to call every night to either have are room cleaned or to get towels.. Very bad family trip.. pool was great the people were great.
10,This hotel used to be great. Key point used to be. Check in was horrible because I had 2 reservations and I had to check out to check back in and reservations were still causing issues. Get to the rooms. Oh man talk about gross. I’ve never seen them so disgusting. We are stay for 7 days and it just put a damper on our stay. Seems like since we were here last it went down hill even more. Save your money spend some extra money either get a suite or go to a different hotel altogether.
30,Slow check in!  Confusing checkout.  Run down room.  Dirty filters.  Injured at pool on lawn chair.  Need louder music at pools.  Room not stocked adequately for our stay.  Hair and bugs on floors.  Filthy filters needed changed.
50,The service is great and the staff is friendly in every department. Highly recommend staying here! I know we will be in the near future. Prefect spot on the strip with great views if you like the mountains.
10,To start with the workers at the front desk was rude and unwilling to be of any assistance other than giving you a room number and key card for same. The first room we had was like walking in an oven it was hot. We left the room to do some walking and looking around before Blue Man Group show started. The show was amazing and we all enjoyed it. When we got back to our room it was still hot we had called front desk before we left to go to the show. The maintenance man came to check AC after we got back and he told us the rooms was warm and we could get desk to give us a room on cooler side of the hotel. We did move and the other room was a little bit cooler but still warm to try and sleep in. They never did come make beds or even bring clean towels and remove dirty towels or carry trash out. Guess it was too hot for their workers to work inside the rooms. Someone on our floor had ribs delivered or they brought them back to their room to eat and just threw bones in the walkway. The next morning they was still in the walkway. This was the 4th hotel we have stayed in on our vacation so far by far the most expensive and the most disappointing.
50,They accommodated my husband and I so that we could be on the same floor as my daughter and granddaughter as we were there for my daughters 21st birthday. The hotel is very nice and clean the staff were friendly and it didn’t seem over crowded like other hotels.
30,I used to stay here all the time pre-covid and never had any issues. This time I encountered a few. No towels and a dirty bathroom on check-in. Brought towels didn't clean bathroom. The A/C didn't work so I sweat all night. I was only there for one night so I didn't make it an issue. The pool was dirty and the pool staff didn't seem very enthusiastic. I've always enjoyed this place. Perhaps they have a case of the covid blues.
50,The staff every one is always so nice and helpful. The location on the back end of the strip is perfect for me. Not all trapped in the middle of a bunch of casinos all in traffic Close buy stores to stock room with water drinks food ect....
30,Our room wasn’t clean. We found hair on the toilet paper and inside the shower. Next we found random needs all over the floor. After we looked at the sheets on the bed they weren’t clean and had stains on them. Finally weed smokers were next to us and made our room reek.
20,The room did not meet my expectations. I have stay in many MGM hotels and this was the worst. The AC did not work properly. Housekeeping only gave fresh towels once. The room was just in despair despite paying for a refurbished room. Made it hard to unwind after having a day full of activities on the strip.
30,Stayed here for a bachelorette. The only nice part was we didn’t have to wait in any lines to check in or out because of the MGM app. Loved that part. But it was honestly just a room to sleep in. We had one of the “newly renovated rooms” and it was terribly designed. The bathroom shower only has 1 glass pane so the water splashed literally all over the bathroom floor and soaked the mats. The elevators sound so sketchy and are very beaten up. Some even shake while they’re moving.
30,Great hotel love the decor.. My only major problem was that we were missing towels.. We had drying towels but no face and hand towels when we check in.. Made a call that night and the next day it took several hours before towels show up.
20,The staff was great however for the money you would expect things to be at minimum maintained however the rooms haven’t been touched in 28 years. In a city trying to conserve water the faucets continue to run 10-15 seconds after the are turned off. It just seems like it’s time for some remodeling.
30,Though it's a bit of a walk from front desk to get to the west Tower elevators it's definitely worth it to be near the pool entrance if you plan on spending time at the pool. The elevators were quick and the floor seemed pretty quiet. We had a 2 bedroom suite which upon entry was fabulous but upon closer inspection you can tell that the room hasn't been booked in a while. There was a fair layer of dust on the dressers cabinets and table which we just lived with but it would seem that they would have had housekeeping come give it a good once over prior to arrival. The slots were tight and a lot of older machines. We ate at the Public House which I'd rank a 4/5 decent price decent food and decent price. Staff was friendly all around. I definitely would recommend for those on a budget. For everyone else I'd advise to pay a little more to stay at one of MGMs middle tier hotels.
10,Nothing works the staff nothing it sucks not professional at all I will never ever in life start at this place again my kids even hated it here so never coming back I recommend nobody ever comes to the place
40,Overall Luxor is a great place to stay. The hotel is being renovated so I suggest you please ask for one of the newly renovated rooms as the older ones are falling apart as in my case this time. The first room I was given was falling apart and the AC broke in 118 degree weather. I notified the front desk and was immediately given a change of rooms. The new room was perfect and helped us enjoy the rest of our stay. Great customer service with an area of places to eat that are both reasonably priced and delicious. TENDER STEAKHOUSE make reservations now and go you won’t be disappointed.
10,Rooms are dirty elevators look third world staff is rude pools have bio hazard. Hallway dirty . Trust me this is a dump a motel 6 would be a step up at the same price go stay at the Trump it's the same price and super nice
10,I would never stay here again. Manager could care less that I had my Apple AirPods stolen and I knew exactly when it happened. Manager was just interested in the next customer I have never made a complaint against any management.
30,Not bad for a comp was confirmed in a suite but once I was sent my key via the app discovered I was downgraded...was told they overbooked the comp suites and downgraded all the one night stays...I realize its a comp but I had other hotel options and it wouldve been nice to have been told instead of having to go ask why...
10,We stayed at the hotel while we were there for a basketball tournament. The rooms are old and outdated. Our room was at least 85 degrees the sun was beating through the windows even though we closed the blinds. The thermostat on the wall fell off the wall and was not connected to anything. It wouldn't change off of 65 but again it was never below 80 degrees even at night. The elevators were disgusting trash on the floors and dirty. One of the elevators shook so bad the door was separating from the wall as it was moving.
20,We experienced significant issues with the air conditioner in the room it was 81° in the room at times and we were unable to get it to Cole. It took multiple efforts and calls to get somebody to fix the situation which was remediated by providing a box fan.    The hotel is decent but definitely not one of the final hotels on the strip at this time
10,The resort credit has to many limitations. And the shops have incompetent staff. Room charges are difficult and this is no 5 star hotel. If your giving somebody resort credit you shouldn't put so many restrictions on how to use them within the resort.
10,Room smelled like a combination of old cigarette smoke and mildew. AC ran at max and never cooled the room. Only half of a shower door so the floor was soaked after every shower. No bath mat hand towels or wash cloths in room. Bad overall experience.
20,The hotel room was extremely hot and humid. Even with the A/C turned all the way down it was very hot. The staff was very friendly and the cafe has great food. There needs to be more hand sanitizer stations around the casino.
30,I was supposed to have a newly remodeled queen suite and it was not. The chairs were old and stained. The A/C was not working very well and the room was pretty warm so it was hard to sleep. The water pressure in the shower was terrible. The casino smelled like a bowling alley they need a better air filtration system.
10,"Stay away. Rooms are hot as hell elevators are across hotel from rooms bedsheets aren't changed out  and hallways are filthy. Help desk was not helpful at all in getting any issues solved and when I actually went to the front desk about my complaints I was given false directions to the ""managers"" office."
20,Very disappointed with stay room terribly overpriced at my stay hotel and pool felt extremely crowded despite some pools being closed elevators with very long delays walkway slanted (?) with liquid in carpet no fridge or microwave

20,We were not impressed…asked for extra pillows-nope sorry…asked for towels after our room was not serviced (while we were out all day) and waited over an hr and still nothing went downstairs-sorry no help…customer service was just not there! Rooms were hot and air conditioner leaked so floor was wet! It’s hard to keep those rooms cool with heat beating down on the windows!
10,While staying at the Luxor I had their dry selection of food and after eating I had the worst constipation ever causing me to have a brain hemorrhage which almost ended my life. Never will I eat the food their again and I am so lucky to be alive today! Not kidding not a joke review.
10,I booked a stay for a room with a hot tub to celebrate an anniversary. Once I arrived I got a weird vibe with the parking location (which is extra by the way). The room we got looked nothing like what was being offered online. I went down to reception and got upgraded to a suite with no tub. You can smell the mold from a great distance will never be back and will make sure my friends and family do not stay here.
30,We stayed for an entire week. The room was as expected for the price. Bathrooms need remodeling. Bed was too hard. Room was hot even with the thermostat set at 68. Checked in with the mobile app to avoid the extremely long check in queue.
10,Watch for front desk personnel all they want is to make sure you have a horrible stay or leave that property totally disappointed The front desk worker Pena far the most rude person I have ever encountered as Customer/Guest at the MGM properties
10,5 day 4 night stay in 2 rooms. Housekeeping came once and that was only after I called. The pool offers zero shade. Had a spa treatment which was nice but felt unwelcome by the aesthetician. The facial itself was nice though. Front desk person at check in was helpful. Large trash bags were left in the halls for at least a couple of days. Front desk girl in spa was one of the rudest and dismissive people I encountered. Gym was decent.
40,I stayed here for a family trip it was a good stay the only problem was the rooms AC wasn’t really working so when we came from outside and expecting the room to be nice and cold it was the same temperature as the hallway but over all good stay
50,Everything was great from check in to leaving. Lived that the 3 hotels were connected and dad not have to go out. We took them stadium tour and that was even in walking distance. We have told other family members to stay here.
10,The hotel does not look like what's on the website. Very deceitful..  The air barely blew any cool air  If you move around to much you would start sweating.  The bathroom floors were.dirty and the carpet had not been vacuumed    I will never stay at the Luxor nor recommend any one else to stay there either.
10,we stayed 5 nights and our rooms were cleaned only twice. bathroom was blocked. Ac was not working. it took hours before they were fixed. and bathroom was not cleaned after it was fix with the drainage problem. it made the room smelly all night
10,This place doesn’t have drinking fountains on and none of the escalators worked. Didn’t have a room fridge so we had to buy a water for $6 everytime we were thirsty. Staff are all grouchy and don’t care to help when you ask for it. When you pay $40/day in resort fees. These things should be available. Will never stay at the Luxor again
30,We were surprised during check in at this hotel that refrigerator is not a standard amenity in the standard room. This information is not available easily while booking the reservation. Information is on website but hidden and very difficult to access in the FAQ part of the hotel website. Discussion of this issue with hotel staff was very non welcoming almost hostile and rude.
10,Booked two queen room in the pyramid got a smelly king in the west tower with a sink that didn't drain. Spent over an hour trying to check in electronically (doesn't work after midnight). Spent another hour in the lobby line. Finally got to our room at 3:30 A.M. They offered us a cot to make up for not having two beds. They got it to our room at 5:30.... thanks for waking us up! As compensation they waived the resort fee. I would have preferred having the room I booked at full price.
50,Room was so clean smell so nice food was good but kind of expensive this was on the food court restaurants only with appointment so my meals were only fast food one hot dog 2 sodas and a philly cheese steak sandwich Almost 40 dlls beside this everything was super
50,This was our first time in Vegas as well as this hotel. Everything about the hotel was on point from check in to check out. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Rooms were lovely. The uniqueness of the hotel was a big hit for us.
20,Poor mattress quality and filthy room with urine from previous guest dried and still on toilet. Temperature of daughter’s room was unbearably hot. Sticky substances on nightstand and dresser. Won’t Recommend this property due to the lack of cleanliness during pandemic.
50,This was my first time in vegas as well as the luxor. Both myself and my son enjoyed our stay there. The beds were very comfortable and the room was nice and clean and the staff were very nice. I will definitely make this my go to hotel!
10,Service for drinks was the worst I ever had. I upgrade the room and it was still a horrible room i ended up going to other hotels to have fun instead of there. As a mlife member i really expected a lot more.
20,We got there on a day that the temp was 118 out and our pyramid room was hot like the air wasn't working. We gave it the benefit of the doubt and decided to see what happened once the sun went down. There was no refrigerator in the room for my insulin and when we called down they were going to charge us $25 for a fridge for the time we were there until I mentioned my insulin then they offered to bring us one for free. On our second day there we went back to the room after seeing one of their exhibits and we noticed water leaking from the ceiling. Called housekeeping who said they would send maintenance after 30 minutes my fiancé called the front desk to try and expedite maintenance and waited on hold for nearly an hour before hanging up and going downstairs. Once in the lobby he spoke to three different people and stood in two lines before finally getting a manager who wouldn't do anything without my there since the room was in my name. There solution was to move us to another room but we had to repack all of our stuff. We asked about moving of the fridge and the manager said the bellman who will be moving our stuff could do it. While packing we discovered another leak that missed my wedding dress by barely a foot. The bellman came to move us and refused to move the fridge telling us that was housekeeping responsibility. Once in the new room housekeeping said front desk had to get us a new fridge so we wasted another hour trying to get a new fridge delivered. If you use the MLife rewards and My Vegas Slots rewards none of the staff is on the same page and won't give you accurate information about redemption of your rewards. I had to waste over half of mine while there because of being misinformation.
50,Clean great valet staff and not too crowded compared to other hotels. Loved being close to seeing Blue Man Group. Will be returning again. Great food options just would like a couple more options. Also easy access to Excalibur and Mandalay Bay without having to bear summer heat.
10,There was only one door in the shower so every time you took a shower the floor flooded. There was only 1 hook in the bathroom for 3 people to hang their hooks on. They wanted $25 to rent a refrigerator. And the vodka/tonic with lime that I brought up to the room Wednesday night was still there Monday morning when we checked out.
30,Came with a group (10 rooms) for our son basketball tournament. We got a room on the 6th floor of Pyramid side. Very ordinary room. Looked old. Bathroom had drainage issues. Air conditioning was poor and loud. Elevators were inefficient. Pool closes art 7 pm just when the sun started to mellow down.
20,Where do I begin? The whole time we were at Luxor the service was mediocre at best. We never felt totally welcome there. We ate at Diablos and the service was bad. They were out of what we wanted and the manager complained about our party in front of us. We will never stay at Luxor again.
30,The check in was great as we used the app. We went to our room amd there was a foul smell coming from the restaurant. The elevators were falling apart as stuff was rattling everywhere and swinging. Our room had ceiling damage from a leak. There was ample spots and tables but there still could have been more compared to the other casinos. Staff at the front desk were rude when I asked if I could have my play examined to see if I could have my resort fees comped. Overall not a terrible stay just not for what I paid.
10,Mold growing in the restroom. Toilet was moving every time you would sit. Hairs found all over the room. Tv didn't work the sound would cut out and turn off. I have video of roaches in the hallway. Housekeeper was annoyed when taking my complaint
40,I got to Vegas fairly later in the evening when the front desk line was long. I️ didn't Have time to check in online earlier but knew I️ should have. Assuming it was too late I️ just hopped in line. A sweet girl walks up and explains I can check in online! She walks me through the process and gets me a key(which a digital is available on the app 10/10 recommend!) This entire process was about 4 min! I got to the room finally and was a little disappointed. Empty used water bottle on the floor and a used food wrapper. Didn’t give me the best feeling the room was cleaned but apart from those the room DID look clean!
20,Old dirty not worth the price. Trash outside the room stayed for days. No fridge in room; it's an additional cost. Pool is a concrete jungle; no shade. Elevators seem like they're about to kill you.
10,Paid extra for good view and got room on 2nd floor with view of bus parking. No fridge or coffee pot in room. No body wash in room. Room and bathroom decor were outdated. Overall room was way overpriced for what you get in value.
50,I occasionally wander away from Luxor but the lure of the pyramid always brings me back. I love the views. The staff is always kind courteous and helpful. My room is always clean and the pool is always cool for the Temptation Sunday pool party. Keep it up Luxor.
30,room was ok roomed in tower instead of pyramid as we didn't want to wait for our room to be cleaned and then have to get back in the 30+minute line for keys. App was working for online check in. room did not get cleaned the first night had to ask to be cleaned on the 2nd night the 3rd and 4th time was ok. air not working well but that may have been due to the excessive heat outdoors
40,The hotel was good. The pool was only open until 7 pm daily. There was too many loud guests when I was trying to sleep at 3 an 4 am. Some restaurants were closed and the parking lot was closed on Friday and Saturday night due to over parking.
10,The hotel room was atrocious! Dirty stains on the carpet and furniture. The bed sheets were dirty. I asked the staff members to find a tour meeting point within their hotel and no one would assist me!
30,Our experience is out own. I think if our room wasn't so hot we would have had a better experience. i definitely think that everyone should go and try it though because not everyones experience is the same. Definitely wont be going back though unless i see something different the next time i go
10,We had a bad experience staying at the Luxor we had mold in the pillow cases and they refused to change the room.    I asked for partial refund and it was refused. The room was extremely hot and instead of fixing the A/C or offering a new room they offered me a FAN which did not solve the issue.    very frustating.
40,I'll start off by saying this place was nice. My only two complaints (and they're small complaints) were the shower and the check-in process. The shower had no barrier to keep the water in and was level with the floor so showering was messy. There was always a pool of water left on the floor and the towel we put down to absorb some of that just got soaked.    The check-in process was more time-consuming than I thought it should be. That could be due to the hour we checked in or it being Vegas or just a lot of people having issues checking in. We arrived at 2:00 a.m. and didn't get checked in and in our room until after 3:00. We had to wait in a line for most of that. I will say the guy at the front desk helped us a whole lot and made the process smooth.    All in all I would definitely stay here again. I loved the pillows. It was clean. I'm not much of a gambler but the lobby had everything a gambler's heart could dream of. There was a Starbucks (coffee is a necessity to us.) various shops restaurants and shows. They had the Bodies exhibit when we went and a Titanic one; both of those looked interesting. It was also not a bad walk from the new strip. Anyways I highly recommend!
30,Our room never cooled down because the AC didn’t really work and when we showered the bathroom floor would have a puddle of water because of poor design for a half shower door long line and wait time to talk to someone when I was able to talk to someone about it they did offer to switch rooms but it was our last night there and we were given back a partial resort fee if it wasn’t for our room issues it is a great hotel!
50,Was hoping for a little more accessible to the casino west tower to the floor took so long . The billing and also phone customer service was just not it. When needed help took me hours to get a hold of someone.
10,Rooms in need of an update. The air conditioning did not work average temp in my room was 86 degrees when I set the a/c at 60. No bath math had to find towels on a service cart. Definately will not stay there again.
30,All 3 of the rooms I booked had plumbing issues the sink and bath tubs didn't not drain properly which did not made our rooms not up the standard according to the new CDC guidelines.  But outside of that the staff and casino area was wonderful.
40,Honestly for the price this hotel was great! The rooms were up to date! It is at the end of the strip but doesn’t feel too far especially taking the deuce bus. I’d definitely stay here again and recommend to people.
50,It’s always nice staying here. Staff is very helpful and friendly . It has everything you need for the whole family to have fun all times of the day ! The spa is definitely amazing and relaxing . Pool area was nice clean .
10,We had so many issues. Our room was lacking amenities we were hoping for and expected (fridge safe) the hot water in the shower was unreliable in the mornings the cleaning staff entered our room without knocking TWICE on two separate days and our room didn’t get cleaned on our third day (which would be completely fine if we were informed they wouldn’t come each day but we weren’t so we expected new towels etc. and our towels were left on the bathroom floor as instructed by the sign in the bathroom reading “don’t hang towels if you want fresh ones”).    The above paled in comparison to the evening we were locked out of our room for an hour and a half because the battery was dead in the door lock. It took three trips back and forth between the front desk and our room to finally get an answer for why the lock wasn’t working and get the locksmith there to change the battery. We missed my birthday dinner reservation with our friends due to the time it took for this to be handled. It was a complete farce. The front desk manager waived the resort fees as an apology but to be honest I would have fought the resort fees either way due to the state of the hotel and our very disappointing experience.
10,I was downgraded with no communication prior to me getting to the hotel. I reserved a 2 bedroom penthouse which was confirmed but found out it was not available until I got there and mgr was no help. The line was over 1 hr with everyone clearly frustrated in waiting for check-in. And I can go on and on about the things that went wrong with my stay at Luxor but rest assured I will never stay there again. I go to Vegas at least 4-6 times a year and have never been treated the way I’ve been treated at Luxor before. Horrible. The manager at check in had no customer service skills and basically told me to kick rocks because I had to take my issues up with my host and it’s not his problem. I needed calling my host 9 times at 1am before I got through to her and she was able to talk to the manager at check in. Only to be told too bad the room is not available for whatever reason. And instead of the 2 bedroom penthouse I reserved they gave me 2 connecting rooms. I was told sorry but it’s comped so too bad.
30,Great stay overall drink and staff were great. Rooms were dated... mold and silverfish in showers and peeling paint in bathroom vanity. We slept well and the rooms were comped. Stayed in the tower would have preferred the pyramid though.
10,"Went to Vegas to celebrate our son's 14th birthday. We decided to ""upgrade"" to a corner Queen suite for this special occasion. When we got to our room we couldn't believe how trashed it was. Pendant light hanging by the wires broken furniture peeling wallpaper filthy paint on doors what looked like ""sex"" stains on the sofa broken and chipped baseboard throughout and strong smell of second hand smoke in the room.    Had our room changed but the second room was only marginally better.    We requested a rollaway bed for one of our kids 3 times and didn't receive it until 12:30 am. Having the kids go to bed so late ruined the next day for everyone.    It was impossible to get any staff on the phone. We tried from both the house phone and our cell phone and were hung up on after holding for over 20 minutes.    My recommendation would be to look further and select a newer hotel as the Luxor is very much past its prime."
10,Baby roaches in bathroom ac don’t work properly it was sooo hot in the room no water pressure in the shower room wasn’t cleaned right trash in cans in both room and bathroom when we checked in wouldn’t stay here again ever
10,Bad air conditioning system was given a fan instead. Moved to tower and not much better. Bathroom door was rotting away on bottom. Slots were not paying out. Terrible experience. Not sure how people stay there.
10,The place stunk of ordors on the caroets all the way around the casino need ata upkeep and restored to its luster it has a very nice theme but stinks and need to b clean went to cashiers and the back of their monitors was full of dust that you could right your name on it
20,Hotel looks nice from the outside. Had issues with self parking as there is road construction nearby and the alternate route is not posted. MGM Checkin app does not work if you reserve more than 1 room. Door lock battery died during stay and could not get into room. Security can not even open the door when the battery dies. Engineering team needs to do this and it took over an hour for them to arrive. Paid extra for renovated room and the AC unit was old and did not work well. Room did not cool off for a few hours after the sun went down The shower design is awful. There is no door or curtain and water sprays out. Door to bathrooms had water damage due to this. This was in both rooms. The room décor was nice and the bed was comfortable. Cleaning staff did a great job on the room but sheets and trash piles were not picked up from the rooms that were cleaned and in the hallway for more than a day.
20,The room was terrible the room was supposed to be newly renovated but they forgot to update the ac the room was hot and muggy with no air flow and the ac leaked water into the floor. We were with a group and this was the general consensus amongst us.
10,*Room was not worth the high price.  *Kept coming into the room without permission.  *Room was not clean.  *Got charged a price that was different from what I was told from the jump.  Will not visit again
10,The hotel was horrible and things were broke. I called about getting things fixed and no one came to fix the problem. So I’m done and next year I’m staying at the MGM. I’m done with the Luxor and there’re rooms.
10,The rooms lack any fridges or coffee makers. The rooms were dirty with vomit stains squishy floors the outside walkways smelled gross on of my friend's room lacked a shower door. This hotel was fairly cheap for being on the Strip but it showed. I wouldn't seriously recommend to anyone getting a room here. The staff was mostly rude except for a handful of people at the Bell Desk. The dealers would throw ids back at you and were not pleasant individuals. The only positive is the minimums to bet are low compared to most of the other casinos.
50,The staff at Luxor was always going above and beyond. One afternoon while we were obviously frustrated because of not being able to locate some elevators a busy repairman paused his particular project to personally escort us to the appropriate elevators.
10,Booked 2 rooms.  Both cabinets under the tvs were broken.  The air conditioning worked but was not as cool as other rooms I've stayed in.  Curtains were difficult to open.  In one room there was soiled floors in the corner with a white residue on the wall next to where it was wet.  In the other room the drain in the shower was backed up and took about 30 minutes for the water to drain. Only 1 tv remote worked.  Went to mlife desk multiple times and it was closed. I asked the lady at the cashier if they were open (it was 10am at the time) and the last stated they were supposed to open at 8am but no one ever showed up. I was not able to redeem my free play for booking the room because of this.  I have stayed at many mlife hotels and I am a gold card holding member. And not once have I experienced a hotel or service like this. I will not be staying at luxor again nor will I recommend to anyone else.
20,The first room I received smelled like they smoked everyday in there. Then they gave me another room that didn't look clean the tub was full of water like it was clogged up and there was an open bar of soap in the shower and the bed was kind of wrinkle and just thrown up. Which is why I thought no one clean the room. The second room still smelled like smoke and the neighbors was very noisy and I couldn't rest. Horrible stay. This hotel needs an upgrade and more restuarant inside. We should not have to walk over to another hotel to get food. Everything we need should be inside of your hotel.
30,Our stay was for a total of 7 nights. The hotel is only concerned with making money. I don't understand why complimentary water is not available in the rooms for the price that you pay. The hotel room air does not get cool even at night after it has rained. Expect to park miles away from your room especially if there is an event going on. Hotel guest are not #1 here. Other than that the rooms were fairly decent. The bed was comfortable and housekeeping comes by daily. Keep a good pair of walking shoes handy because you will need them.
30,"Room was still hot after the AC was ""fixed"" and the maintenance man told us a guilt trip story about how we needed to call his boss and give him praise for doing his job because he gets alot of bad reviews. Soooo unprofessional."
10,My stay was very terrible due to several attempts to get my air conditioner repaired. And I've notified the the front desk several times before that I have a heart problem and the clerk told me that the room was fine and the ac unit was new. And told me that it will be OK. So I've ask for a manager and I was told that the manager is out if town. My room temperature was 91 degrees the first time I arrived and checked in. The second time I told the front desk they said it would be fixed in a hour. So me and family tries to relax in the casino. Four hours later the same problem I kept telling them I am a heart patient and can't stay I a hot room and they told me it is what it is. So I had to get someone in the casino to find a manager. After several hours they decided to find me another room. I'm a inspector for the state of Texas and this experience was the worst ever.
10,Worst customer service rooms smelled like marijuana dirty hair in the shower pool area had green algae water the pool it self had water as clear as horchata ( that’s a cloudy Hispanic drink) elevators missing screws on panels and feeling like your going to die. You pay for what you get MGM you need some serious work/remodel at the LUXOR (maybe a new casino) will never stay at this place where again even if it’s free
10,The hotel was a horrible experience on my birthday. We stay in Vegas every year and Luxor was the worst. Rooms were hot not cleaned and carpet wet from AC leak. They had to move my husband and I four times!
10,Terrible experience with check in and with room. Wasn't handled with a reasonable response after notifying front desk. Expected more from the Luxor where we've stayed multiple times. Probably our last time there
40,Very friendly staff clean hotel…. only thing I didn’t like was housekeeping or someone walking in my room… I don’t know who it was because i went under the covers … I didn’t have on clothes. Next time I will put that extra deadbolt on the door. The door was locked they use the key card to get in. I just didn’t have the extra lock 🔐 .
20,The room smelled of mildew and smoke. We just used it to sleep but it should have been checked before it was being used. There was a crack in the bathroom ceiling where paint and water have peeled away to reveal a leak.
20,Stayed in a tower premium tile floors are very dirty black stained. Bathrooms black and green mold coming through the tile. Our room was missing sink stopper. Switched to Premium pyramid room which was much nicer yet the AC is small and can't cool down the room called front desk 20 minutes later told 3 hour wait for maintenance to check AC I working not staying in hot room. Moved back to another tower premium room lights were already on again tile black stains everywhere but so tired don't care. Front desk is nice and friendly. Restaurant choice sucks need more variety. Nothing 24hours. The walking sidewalks never worked between luxor and Excalibur.
30,Stayed in a tower room. Roomy and clean for the most part(very dated). Bedding was another story. Lumpy bed and the pillows felt like towels stuffed in a sack. And could never get the room cooled down.
10,This was no different then a Motel 6! Ac didn’t work room smells badly like cigarettes and weed if that’s what your all about then it’s perfect for you! Nothing at all good to say about this hotel and when confronting the Mrg. of this issues they blame Covid!
10,This is an older property that shows it's age. It has the atmosphere and the setup to be a unique incredible hotel with character and charm. Instead a lack of upkeep and a lack of care have turned it into one of the worst Mlife properties.    My room was big and beautiful with a fun layout and almost everything I could want in a room (except for a missing coffee machine but this is Vegas). However the AC never got my room below 80 even when the outside temperature dropped into the 80's at night. It stayed warm and humid. Speaking to other guests this was an issue for almost everyone. The fixtures needed work the handles in the sink faucet were loose and came off if you turned them too quickly.    The casino is old and smells like smoke significantly more than the other casinos I've stayed at. The Cashier and Mlife rewards area only had one person working at any given time.    The food was about what I expected. Although I was disappointed in the lack of gluten free options and the upcharge.    The pool was nice although there was virtually no shade and the cabana's and daybed's are ridiculously overpriced and to be clear I mean for Vegas they're overpriced. $425 for a cabana on the day I inquired virtually the same price as at Bellagio ($450) for something inferior in every way.    I really wish they'd fully renovate the property and turn it into something beautiful.
10,Poor customer service from start to finish. Waited in a 3 person mobile check in line for a hour. The rooms were dirty and I had to switch rooms. Then to top it off No report of lost AirPods means staff found them and didn’t report it.
50,The Luxor has it all. Good food casino shows and price. Like all casinos that are not new to the strip the Luxor exhibits some wear and tear. However everything is clean and accommodating. Staff is friendly and helpful.
10,Understaffed lines for front desk and cashier extremely long and slow. Property was dirty and in disrepair. No door on stalls in men’s restroom broken handrail on stairway wall trim pieces broken and laying in hallway. Hallway carpets filthy.
50,Planning a trip to Vegas stay in a real accomodating hotel! They provide clean spacious and luxourious rooms with staff above the rest. You will enjoy the new app for easy check in and check out. The protocol the hotel has in place allowed me to feel safe and comfortable during my short stay. There was always staff around to assist me and everyone I encountered was pleasant and helpful. I will return!!!
10,So disappointed. Went here for my husbands 30th bday he really wanted to stay at this hotel and was let down. Location is average. Value is awful. Carpet was soaking wet for 3 days and despite calling the front desk multiple times it was never resolved. Never got deposit for the room back and they even tried charging me an additional $60 while I was asleep in the room one of the nights (I paid upfront for everything and didn’t charge anything to the room).Could have been worse 3 different people on 3 different occasions on our trip asked us if our room was hot because their AC’s weren’t working at all. Do NOT stay here!!!
10,"This is one of the worst hotels I have ever stayed at. From the room the amenities the spa the pool everything is bad. The funny thing is when we checked in we were told this room would be a free ""upgrade"" to a newly renovated room. Holy crap if this was a renovated room I would hate to see what a lower-quality one looks like. This place needs some serious TLC or to be bulldozed and rebuilt from the ground up.    During our stay the temperature in Vegas was a consistent 105-110 degrees every day and our air conditioner barely put a dent in that ambient temperature. The AC looked as though it was installed in 1980. It was cranked to the lowest possible setting but pumped out humid lukewarm air. By the looks of the unit I'm surprised it was even functioning at all.    The room did not have a refrigerator microwave coffee maker or any other basic appliance you would expect in a modern hotel room. Leftovers from meals had to be stuffed in the ice bucket to stay cool for a while which was difficult in a hot room.    The TV was old the channel selection was small and half of them were either not available or had a poor signal. Also the connection panel below the TV appeared to be from the '90s as it offered an array of obsolete interface options for the TV.    The sanitary condition of the room was disgusting. The carpets were dirty smelly and sticky. As soon as I removed my shoes I noticed my feet peeling off of the carpet as I walked around. The rest of the room was not clean and had an overall grimy feeling to it. I could not tell if the sheets had been changed or washed.    The shower was satisfactory but the drain was clogged. However the shower door only covers half of the stall and tons of water splashes out of the other side while using it. What a dumb design. The toilet was beaten up and scratched and took a minimum of two flushes to clear no matter what. The towel service was pretty consistent so no complaints there.    My bedside lamp merely flickered and didn't work. I tried changing the bulb from a different lamp but it still did not work. For reference both bulbs worked in the other working lamp. I couldn't swap the lamps because the malfunctioning one's power cord snaked behind the bed frame which I wasn't going to attempt to move.    The Luxor does not offer room service so you are stuck with whatever food options are offered in the casino most of which close early. Also the one time I attempted to buy a drink from the machine next to the ice maker the card reader malfunctioned and would not read any of my credit cards.    The elevators sound like an accident/lawsuit waiting to happen. No joke some of these lifts clank squeak and wobble the whole way up and down. They are also covered in graffiti and the service panels all appear to have been kicked in. Seriously service these death traps because they are in bad shape.    On my second night I went and got a massage at the spa. Mediocre would be a fair description of it. The room in which I received my massage was small cluttered and uninviting. The massage itself was just okay. The shower stall that I used afterward was clogged and I was standing in ankle-deep water the whole time. All in all not worth the money spent on the service.    The pool was fine. It's pretty lame that there are no umbrellas or shade spots available unless you pay at least $200! My 32 oz cocktail also cost me $30 which is crazy but I guess getting gouged is part of the experience? The water itself was warm but to be fair it was 110 degrees outside. Although the entire pool is 3.5 feet deep which sucks.    The wait at the Pyramid Cafe for breakfast was crazy long. But once we got seated the waitresses were friendly and the food was good.    The Bodies exhibit was cool I enjoyed walking through it.    The online checkout experience was easy and fast. However I was not emailed a folio showing my room charges. That should be standard procedure for any hotel."
50,Was nice and clean to gamble restaurants were impeccable when checking in the service was amazing i felt safe leaving my car in the hotel parking. The only negative thing I have to say was house keeping was very behind on changing things in our room.
50,Thank you for the great service and clean rooms. My friends and i had a great time. I liked the mobile experience. Checking in and checking out was incredibly easy. Ill be coming back soon to this hotel.
30,Our room was not services by housekeeping for two of the three days we were there. On the 21st (top) we had no cell service and no wi-fi. we had to go to the lobby to check out local businesses or to call them.
50,Every time we come to Vegas we stay at the Luxor. I have never had a trip to Vegas that my needs were not met. Our hotel room is always beautiful clean and an amazing view. The hotel staff and service has always taken care of all of our needs.
30,Out dated furniture and rugs. My bathrooms AC vent didn’t work way to hot in bathroom. Also toilets are old and very loud. Not so clean rooms/bathrooms. Pool was cloudy and dirty lots of things floating.
20,Seems as if nothing has been done since to build of the hotel. I need of upgrades to include rooms elevator pool A/C. Restaurants not open and or close way to early. Beds are worn and need replacement.
30,I went there for the Garth Brooks concert. The location was great and everything was close walking distance. The main reason for complaining is the constant smell of marijuana in the room  the hallways and elevators. I understand that it legal there but that doesn’t mean I want to smell it on my way to my room or in my room all night long.
30,They get you with a $31 room rate but then they add a $35 resort fee to it. The room was barely adequate - poor condition air conditioning not working properly & no amenities. Heard from other guests that all of the pyramid rooms had the same problems.
10,Not happy at all. Few Waitresses were rude when asking for drinks we even tipped well. No fridge in our room 25th floor. 0 comps for my Birthday or Buddies Birthday. Bellagio was better last month. Idk if I'd stay here again tbh. Very dissatisfied for our Birthday weekend.
40,I already stated what I thought of the cafe normally it is fine maybe they forgot what a VIP/LOYALTY card looks like. If i could have had coffee in my room which was not supplied I would have just stayed up there. Long lines at Starbucks I can do without
10,From being locked out of our room twice for nearly an hour each time to the bags of trash lining the hotel hallway this was a horrible place to stay. Disappointed in the Luxor  First time and the last time staying at the Luxor. Gross…..
50,I’ve been to Las Vegas 6 times and each time I’ve stayed at the Luxor. The hotel/casino is amazing and accommodating. The pool cabanas are very comfortable and stuff are great. The rooms are very spacious and comfortable. I love the Egyptian pyramid theme.
20,The elevators were dirty and abused by graffiti and just did not give the impression that you were staying at a quality location. The carpets outside the rooms were dirty and worn. The room was nice and service was very good.
20,The hotel was okay. The steakhouse sucked. Terrible service. Food quality was not there. The hostess ignored us. Server made us wait 20 mins for waters. 20 mins for bread and drink orders. Another 20 for food orders.
40,Was in town for concerts so it was super fun. Very crowded weekend lines for everything. Trash cans need to be emptied more and a coffee maker and mini fridge in the room would have been tight! Bathroom fan was loud.
20,Hotel is fine if staying for a day or two but the rooms have no refrigerators so if you want anything cold you have to trek to the stores in the lobby and pay the ridiculous prices for a water or whatever cold beverage one desires. Towels are stored on a bottom rack under the bathroom sink which to me might as well be on the floor. One towel hook to hang towels for 3 people. No coffee maker in rooms. TV is standard resolution and very few channels. Hotel is way over due for updates/upgrades room-wise.
10,No accountability by staff. Room wasn’t ready for two hours after checkin. Room wasn’t cleaned. Staff acts like they’d rather work at another property. Check out was even worse. Please review processes and motivate staff to take pride in the Brand.
20,"""renovated"" room meant new carpet probably due to recent water damage.  gaping hole where a fridge once was  No usb charging ports anywhere  The worst was the 90 degree room temp at night. We actually had to prop open our door at 4 am. there was Record breaking heat that weekend but the ac should have been sufficient. person staying in room a few doors down had same complaints    I almost always stay at Luxor. Used to be my favorite. but do not think I will stay there again. especially considering it cost 200 per night..after Mlife discount"
10,The room was a disaster all the facilities seemed as if they hadn’t been touched up or upgraded in the last 25 years the bathroom shower drain wasn’t working I would never stay here again. If you can try to find another alternative
40,Usually staying here would work but this time it doesn’t. I spent $200 plus bucks on Lyft/Uber’s/taxis to get yo the festivities down in the middle of the strip Paris/Venetian hotels. With all the venues Megan the Stallion Tim McGraw Burno Mars etc it was hard to really keep it together. But the property was great 😊 & weather was 🥵🥵🥵.
30,Restroom shower was dirty. Only gave two small pillows on the bed. Wifi didn't work at all.A/C in room seem to be on but wasnt cooling the room down. Staff was friendly and checkin was great! Alot of the quick food grabs closed early.
10,"Room was hot called desk about air conditioning and was told ""it's hot outside"" room wasn't cleaned 2 of our 4 days and had to wait hours late at night to get clean towels and wash cloths. Vending machines on our floor ate our money and you could hear the ice machine and elevator in our room that was several doors down the hall. Trucks loading and unloading things right outside our room window waking us up very early in the AM."
10,Resort fees are ridiculous and never explained. Check out supervisor was rude. Air conditioner in my daughters room leaked very bad the whole trip soaked clothes and suitcase. Half the pool was closed!
40,Book room for a major event at Allegiant Stadium. Price for the room was very reasonable with the location so close to the stadium. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Had a couple of problems with our room. Staff corrected issues quickly and efficiently. Location within walking distance to stadium.
40,The staff we encountered were friendly. The elevators could have been kept up a bit more. Casino was more smoky in comparison to other casinos. I like that it’s a short walk to MGM New York New York and Mandalay Bay. Overall it was a decent stay.
30,I’ve always wanted to stay at the Luxor but never knew it was two sides to it and one side would I compared to the Motel 6. If you look into staying at the Luxor book a Tower side room not Pyramid. Other than that it was cool.
50,Great weekend with friends! Machines were hitting Lady Luck was good to us . Food room staff was all great . Everything was clean even though it was busy .We always stay here and love it !!  Highly recommend!
10,The rooms get really hot during the summer probably due to the heat from the pyramid structure. The room had bedsheets with stains.    The parking and valet staff is horrible and not helpful at all. There are long lines everywhere and no one to guide you.
50,the hotel was super nice. i loved the pools. i wish i would’ve gotten a kabana. the pool staff was super rude she needed to be checked asap. the rooms were super clean. the staff inside the hotel were amazing. super nice. i enjoyed my stay. especially the food court lol
10,At check-in the staff said she can give me 2 bottles of water complimentary. She checked and had no more. Checked into a non-smoking suite but once entering the room it smelled like smoke. The jacuzzi looked used as the bottle was half empty. Lifted the tiolet seat and found a towel inside.
20,Hotel room had a smokey/dusty smell.  Room air conditioning never got cold.  Hotel elevators were poorly maintained with broken components and scratches being very visible.  Hotel lobby hallways casino was warm.  Escalators and conveyors were out of service.    Online Checkin-checkout process was seamless and great.
10,I checked in online and it said my room would be ready by 3 at 3 I got a call from Luxor saying my room wasn’t ready. 5 hours later when my room was ready I went inside and the AC was broken. Management just doesn’t care. Very old and needs new employees
20,Terrible outdated room with terrible lighting. Curtains are probably the most outdated things in the room and slide in a very funky way with a long plastic stick. No full length mirrors. Just over all very outdated EVERYTHING. I hope MGM invests or starts over with the land.
10,Our room was discussingly dirty. There was hair in the bathroom and dirty towels under the vanity. Sheets were dirty and the AC did not work. Also had rewards and was told to go to Mlife to redeem and then when I got there the sent me back to the front desk with the long long lines. Terrible!
40,I know it's hot everywhere in Vegas especially when LV hit a record even for them at 117 Degrees! YES 117 Degrees. Anyway my A/C in my room could not keep up and was always warm even well into the night. I suggest travelling to LV when it gets much cooler! And if you like late night snacks Luxor Food Ct. has a Johnny Rockets and Bonanno's Pizza! Casino was active and pretty fun! The whole strip was ROCKIN with the Fight and Garth Brooks! Overall a pretty good trip if you could walk around in your bathing suit 24/7!
10,We stayed for 7 days in a room with non-functional air-conditioning a sink that wouldn't drain a television with either no service or very poor picture quality and a non-working safe. Some days housekeeping did not come. We had problems with both cell service and wifi in our room. The room does not come with a coffee maker and only one Starbucks was open in the early morning with a very long line. The swimming pool was a little bit gross with unidentifiable things floating in it. Also the chairs available without a paid upgrade have zero shade.
20,dogs barking all night and took 2 nights to resolve. The owner sat in the hall at 2am yelling for the dogs to be quiet and was allowed to do so all night. Called the desk multiple nights to get help and they answered only once
50,The air did not work some of the time no trash can in the rooms most of the sockets in the room did not work the swimming pool closed too early the food was great and housekeeping was great. The restaurants are great. Front desk service was great.
50,My husband and I took a vacation for our anniversary and we stayed at the Luxor. It was a beautiful highly themed hotel. We had a premier king room and even with resort it was less than $100 a night. Our room was clean large and relaxing. Even though we were in the pyramid it was quiet at night. Diablos had good food too. We loved the Spa! We got massages our first day and found out we could use their steam rooms sauna and hot tubs all day. Such a wonderful relaxing base for a great trip to Las Vegas.
20,The Luxor hotel is very ‘worn’ and in need of a complete renovation. From hallways to room the experience was not good. The hotel staff though was friendly and the food & beverage outlets were satisfactory for the type of hotel.
20,Staff around the entire hotel were short impatient and unwilling to help guests. From front desk to dining to lifeguards I have never felt like such an inconvenience in a location I was paying to stay at
50,The room was clean and serviced daily by very friendly staff. Many food options including a 24 hour grill. Great fun and DJ at Centra bar. Tenders Steakhouse had excellent food and service. 15 minute walk to TMobile Arena for entertainment events.
50,Very satisfied with the hotel for the money! The hotel and staff were awesome but I was really surprised that there was no mini fridge coffee machine or even cups in the room. The staff was very helpful and welcoming !
10,This hotel needs a major overhaul. The carpets the room decor the common areas are really bad. The AC system is the worst room stayed warm even the common areas were warm. Unkept and one of the worst on the strip.
10,We stayed in one of the Luxor Pyramid corner king suite rooms.    First impression of the Luxor was not very good while walking down the hall to our room we saw a pill in the middle of the floor in front of the room doors. On the last day 4 days later it was still there. Obviously the floors were not vacuumed during our stay.    First impression of our room when we opened the door was that the air conditioning was broken. It was over 80 degrees in our room and the air was turned up as high as it would go but it never did get cool. Also smoking is only allowed in the casino however our room reeked of smoke. The counters in our bathroom were filthy they looked like they hadn't been wiped down for a quite a while. We wiped them down on our first day and they were clean when we left so we were wondering how long it had been since anyone else had cleaned them.    It was also disappointing that there wasn't a single brochure or any information in the room to tell you any of the attractions or even what restaurants are in the Luxor. When we checked in we were given our room keys and nothing else.    Also be aware that parking is not free we valeted our car only to be given a bill for $90 when we went to get our car. I've usually had the parking included when you stay at the hotel so I wasn't prepared for that but the part that really pissed me off was that our vehicle was literally 90 feet from where we dropped it off with the valet and we had to walk to pick it up ourselves what's the point of Valet? So we drug our bags out to where it was parked 111 degrees in full sun I'll park it myself next time.
40,The rooms were very affordable and provided great value and the beds were comfortable. There was no fridge in my room or minibar which was a bummer but I think it was just my style of room. Also there was no real room service after 2pm but it did make us go out and explore more so it wasn't so bad. The location isn't bad but it did require a lot walking to the middle of the strip. Overall I would definly come back if I wanted a good deal and then use that money to splurge in other things.
20,Two separate room issues. Showed up to a dirty room abs was offered a 2-4 hr window to change rooms or have it cleaned properly. Who want to sit around for 2-4 hrs when you’ve just shown up. Then we requested a fridge$25 one time charge no problem except we never got fridge but they still tried to charge me for it on my final bill. I think that’s theft.
10,Wish I could give negative bubbles to match my experience.    From my hastily constructed costumer survey which also rated a zero:    Other than property being even worse than 30-years ago? Being misled by MLife rep who assured me the Tower rooms were on par with Mandalay Bay where I wanted to stay. Walking a real long way from really crappy parking garage in 115 degree heat and unconditioned corridors with bags only to get to room and have mobile key not work. Attempting to return to front desk to be able to get into room was impeded by missing elevator summons buttons. Finally getting in room and finding it filthy and uninspiring and my view being of the third floor roof and HVAC equipment with all the associated noise. Waiting on hold for 1 hour 38 minutes!!! for a Luxor rep and having to ask my wife to try to call from home. (She was on phone over an hour). Sharing all this with hotel staff and management who’s only effort to remedy my experience was to say they were sorry. When I informed the manager I would be leaving without staying in these unacceptable conditions my resort fee and parking were waived but I am still disputing room charges. Much much happier with my Marriott product. Surprised I received this survey since management was aware of my dissatisfaction. MGM seems to be a brain dead and tone deaf company who relies on an undiscriminating clientele to stay at in business. Why don’t you have one of your VPs call me?
10,Our AC was broken upon arrival. We also noticed there was no mini fridge or anywhere to keep anything cool in the room. It took several hours to get through to the desk and more than a day for any response
40,The Luxor Casino is dated but the updated rooms are super nice. Great value and the food options in and around are incredible. I would recommend the Luxor as a fun nostalgic place to stay and play. The pool was fantastic.
20,I was beyond disappointed in the Luxor. I was in town for a tradeshow and the room block choices were for Luxor or Mandalay Bay since convention was at Mandalay. Mandalay was sold out so that wasn’t an option. I will tell you I should have done my research… because I come to Las Vegas for at least 3-4 shows a year but have never experienced such an awful hotel and casino!!! First off the AC in my room was set to 60 and it still was 80 degrees barely blowing any air let alone cold! How is this a Las Vegas hotel and casino with NO coffee machines in the room… NO room service AT ALL… and NOT enough support for the entire amount of people staying here. The casino is not even cool in the least bit!!!!!!! I tried to call the front desk and couldn’t get through for hours… Went downstairs and the check-in like was ridiculous so didn’t even want to wait to ask about the AC. The lighting is so dark even with all the lights on! Heard from many at the show staying here that they experienced the same thing and will never stay here again. I’d rather pay for an Uber to take me to a show here than ever stay here again.
50,I drove ro Las Vegas and stayed 3 nights in a Pyramid Queen room. Bed was comfortable good television nice desk with office chair and 2 other comfortable arm chairs with table. Enjoyed limited dining (Covid) and Fantasy Show.
10,Bad service did not like the service I needed room service and I wasn't able to get a hold of anyone I would not recommend the stay here for this hotel it is not worth what I payed for. Please choose wisely
50,Stayed in a Luxor one bedroom suite very clean and comfortable. The house keeping staff was amazingly helpful and seemed happy. I would highly recommend the Luxor. It may be an older casino but the friendliness of staff makes it all well worth the stay
10,Booked and requested for connecting room. First check in it wasn’t a connecting room. So we queued again got the check in to request change of rooms. Second check in gave us the connecting room but upon entering the room there were luggages in the room. So we had to walk back to check in to ask for another rooms. Took 3 hours to check in 3 times and finally got the right rooms. Requested for crib but no crib requested for extra bed they said they will send over but still to no avail. End up we just bought a crib at target.
20,Dirty underwear in our room garbage in halls graffiti in elevator advertising coke sales $8 for water at the pool with zero shade and crowd looked like they were lost Walmart customers after a hard night. Such a bummer!
10,Room was given away. Got a different room and it was dirty and unvacuumed. Staff was not accommodating at all. Not worth the $300 it cost for one night at all! No room service available even though all restrictions were lifted
10,The room had a faulty Air conditioner when it was 114 degrees outside . I complained from the minute I entered the room  they said they will get it fixed and it didn't happen . I rented a suite for about $ 275- $300 a night . Money down the drain .
50,The overall stay in the hotel was good. The room was good. The casino was a little dirty. The parking is poor. I would probably stay there again when I return to Vegas but it would not be a priority. Too many areas on the property that smelled like marijuana.
10,The room was disgusting  floors dirty  things from previous guest left in the room hair in bed. Wouldn’t recommend this hotel to anyone way over priced for the quality of room. There was an old beat up refrigerator in the room that literally sits on the floor !!!
40,Our overall stay at Luxor was great had a lot of fun and it was easy to navigate. Downfall-it’s at the very end of the strip so when it’s 115 it’s a killer walk. The showers in the King rooms not sure about the others suck so bad. Water literally gets EVERYWHERE. Our ac was messed up but maintenance came by and worked on it. HEAVY cigarette smells in the rooms from the casino but overall a nice place
10,House keeping was terrible . We had to call 4 times to get towels on the last call I had to go downstairs in my pajamas and speak to someone at the front desk . It was 118° in Vegas that weekend all we wanted to do was shower
10,I edited my reservation but luxor created a new reservation. now luxor is double charging me and refuses to correct it. had to dispute charges with credit card company poor customer service luxor for a returning customer
30,Cons: no fridge issue on app so was unaware room was ready until we called at 4:30. We were told to use premium lane however the wait was about 20 minutes. It normally wouldn't have been an issue but we had 7pm show tickets which we just made.  Pros: atmosphere rooms cleanliness food  Overall I'm glad we chose the Luxor for my first Vegas trip and will probably stay again at some point but may try another hotel next time.

Pros: atmosphere rooms cleanliness food  Overall I'm glad we chose the Luxor for my first Vegas trip and will probably stay again at some point but may try another hotel next time.
10,Don't stay on the 13th floor. The hotel management knows the air conditioning units do no work and charge you to bake in your room. Asked the manager to come to my room to see how hot it was. I waited for an hour and no one came. We went to the front desk and they said sorry can't do anything about it. We are booked.
10,The experience and service were horrible. None of the rooms have adequate air conditioning (both my rooms stayed at 85* all three nights) and shared the same experience with every other guest that stayed in the hotel while making small talk in the elevator that trembles and jolts the whole ride. There was black mold in the mini fridge random stains that were sticky on the carpet the bathroom mirror was dirty and the floors dingy. The tub was dirty and appeared to have soap stains from recent use which would attribute from the strong smell of mildew emitting from the carpet most likely due to insufficient cleaning of a clearly soaked carpet occurring from getting out of a tub that is directly next to the bed ( poorly thought out design).  Overall was strongly disappointed having this be my first trip back to Vegas since the pandemic.
20,Second stay here within a months time. First time the room was messy. Wasn’t completely vacuumed. Crumbs all over the nightstands and water rings on the glass. Ac is terrible room is very humid. Front desk service was rude. Got at least 3 eye rolls from our agent when asking questions. Second stay the bathroom shower had half a door. According to front desk that is the new design. So when you shower there’s nothing to stop the water from going onto the tile floor outside. When you’re done showering there’s a puddle of water just waiting for you to trip on. Lazy design. The overall hotel interior corridors are dusty and unkempt. Elevators and elevator lobbies are scratched up and dirty. Smells like weed just about everywhere. Coming in from the parking garage there’s huge roaches or some kind of bugs that are everywhere and even had one jump on my shoulder one evening. The casino is still in decent condition and the casino restrooms are nice and clean. Casino staff are nice and friendly. There’s no more fridges or microwaves. No room service. One bellhop? Bell desk service had a woman who just kept saying she doesn’t know when inquiring about bell desk service. It was not a good experience both times.
40,Just got home from three days in Vegas first time in four trips with no hand pay. Still had a good time although the heat was a bit much. Try Diablo’s for a good meal. Will be going back in the fall.
10,Ac did t work while it was 112 degrees outside. Requested my 3 rooms next to each other and they didn’t do that so we had to move rooms. Super frustrating and the last thing you want to do is stand in the line to change rooms while your in vacation. Also rented a cabana and had terrible service. Way too much for service provided
30,The hallway outside my room was dirty. The carpet didn't smell clean and we noticed that old pizza boxes and empty beer boxes were left in the hall for 2 days. Also the garbage container near the elevators were stinking for 2 days.
50,Clean well staffed with friendly professional people. Beds were amazing. Fluffy towels hot showers. Not on the main strip but close enough. Traffic not extremely busy. Easy to grab a cab. Food venues were great food choices and pricing. Rooms were quiet
10,Was so hot and humid. Ac didn’t work  paid almost 800. Waste of money.. They were so backed up with issues. I will seriously never return here not staffs fault up date your damn room ac units. 115 out side and in the room.
10,Dirty room upon arrival additional fees that were not shown on website when booking nor was it explained at check-in. You will need to ask upon check-in of any additional fees to make your stay less of a hassle. That way you will not have to always go to guest services. Upon check-in also ask if all amenities (towels toilet paper toiletries etc…) are in your room and if your room is clean.
10,Worst hotel to date I’ve stayed in while in Vegas. Poor service. AC broke in 2 rooms we were in; room was not clean at all and there was mold and  Vomit in the bathroom. Super gross and the staff didn’t seem to care.
30,I don’t think the price I paid for the room was worth it but the bed was comfortable. Too many children in the casino. Complimentary drinks (while playing games) were a joke because they were super weak.
10,The room smelled like marijuana. The shower design makes no sense at all the water splashes out all over the floor. My husband slipped and luckily he was able to catch himself. The shower drain was also partially clogged I was standing in 3 inches of water while showering. We stayed for the Garth Brooks concert and when we got back we were hungry but all the establishments were minimally staffed with very long lines. Lastly very long lines at the elevator.
10,Just as the title says-dirty outdated dark and dismal hotel. No refrigerator in the room (there was a place for it) no where to hang wet bath towels no door on shower and elevators extremely slow to arrive
20,My wife and I stayed at Luxor for one night. The place is in desperate need of maintenance across the board: restrooms elevators/inclinators hallways - everywhere. Top management needs to look long and hard at their hotel and fix EVERYTHING that is broken. They should be very very embarrassed at the conditions of their hotel. It has such potential but it takes effort to make it shine. PUT IN THE EFFORT!!!
10,The air conditioning was horrible. My room never got below 90 degrees. There were black marks all over the hand rails where people put out cigarettes. I have never had such a hard time finding a quality meal. There was only one restaurant open and there was over an hour wait to get in.
50,We had an amazing time and loved our room. Only drawback was the lack of microwave and fridge in the rooms. We plan to staff here again in the future and can’t wait to recommend the Luxor to friends and family.
10,"First the mobile app did not check us in correctly we had a 2 room suite and it checked us in to just a regular room. The only way to remedy this is at the front desk where no one answers the phone. Multiple trips down the maze of halls and up and down the loud elevator which sounds like it could just snap and drop us several hundred feet... Once we were in the ""right"" room the air did not work. One of the hottest weekends of the year and we could not cool down. The bed frame is large and awkward it sticks out way beyond the mattress so you rack your leg on the corner everytime you walk around. In order to get in and out of the bed (even for a person that is over 6ft) you have to get on the edge of the frame then transfer to the mattress. Forget about any comfort. Extreme lack of sleep and comfort for a ""suite"" is ridiculous. It really sucks that we actually paid for that horrible experience. On another note the casino was well maintained and the cafè had good food."
30,Very disappointed in the Luxor Pool. It was very hot in Las Vegas (over 105 degrees Fahrenheit) and there was ZERO shade at the pool except cabanas to rent! No shade trees in pots or near seating areas. There were holes everywhere in the concrete deck where large umbrellas could have been placed but there were none. Also NO coffee service in the rooms. No refrigerators in the rooms. If you plan to use the pool in the summer book a different hotel with nicer pool amenities.
10,Wasn’t the cleanest and the people cleaning didn’t really care much for removing the dirty bags from the hallways trash overflowed by the elevators and smelled rotting. Half of the elevators in 2b worked consistently. The one star is because I can’t give them 0 and because the room didn’t smell stale. The shower flooded the bathroom and because of it the wood on the bathroom door was rotting
50,Stayed at Luxor for a week on our honeymoon. We had a blast. I wish more things were open later other than that quiet nice rooms and close to lots of fun on strip. Also cheap ride from the airport as well
50,The girls and I loved our stay! Never had any REAL issues the staff was very friendly and helped whenever needed. Rooms were clean at check in and they provided things needed when asked! We will come back!
10,extremely poor house keeping and room service - parking and room checking is poorly planned and below standard.  The room was missing toilet papers and it took over an hour and multiple phone calls to get resolved. No Coffee maker in room if you are a morning person who drinks coffee or tea as first thing in morning take your coffee maker with you
10,Air conditioner didn’t work in my room. When I called for someone to check it I don’t think anyone came cause it still wasn’t working that day. I felt like I was being bit by bugs. Shower head was falling apart.
10,I can't believe how horrible it is was no refegitor in the room unless you pay $25 really with the temperature 117 that is redeculus and I paid $15 to check in before 3pm dirty our neighbors they put their trash outside the room for 2 days no one came to take it smells bad I had bad experience I will definitely don't recommend to anyone don't spend your money here go somewhere else I didn't enjoy my trip and I don't want to come to this hotel never .😡
10,Bad smell air conditioning not good front deak service is slow.. do not recommend strip has better hotels than this..    Stayed in planet hollywood its bliss!!    Lastly its old hotel eventhough price is low i do not recommend
50,Had a wonderful and easy experience! The staff was friendly and parking was easy. I loved the environment as well as the atmosphere it made me feel welcome and it seems to attract better people than the other hotels.
30,The AC in our newly renovated room did not work. And I was told it wasn't yet upgraded. Why wasn't that FIRST??? I understand that it should be eye catching but if my wife is too hot to sleep what kind of vacation is that forme
20,Both rooms were extremely hot. It was miserable. We were told hotel was fully booked so no rooms to move us to. We went to Walmart to buy fans and also requested addl fans from guest services. It was an awful stay.
50,5 day stay from 7-4-21 to 7-9-21. The property was always clean and our rooms were well kept. All of the staff were extremely helpful. I would like to have had more information on transportation available.
50,"I have always wanted to stay in this hotel; although older it is an icon of the Vegas strip. There is easy check in friendly staff fun museums and several nice pools on the property. Although the elevators or ""inclinators"" are very slow and the rooms could be colder I agree that you get what you pay for."
30,Everything is great except the food court and the beds. The beds are horrible! Couldn't sleep a bit the entire stay. We were there for six nights. The Hotel itself and staff is okay for the amount of money spent. It's location is at the beginning of the strip so it is a long walk to get to some of the other hotels that are a must see.
10,We went to Vegas with another couple and both stayed at the Luxor. Our first room smelled very strongly like marijuana and we requested a change. The second room we found a blood stain on the comforter and an hour and a half later received a new comforter. Our friends initially were booked to stay in a pyramid room but said it was so bad they went to the front desk and elected to pay $30 more a night to stay in a Tower room.    The service of the staff was sub-par and one was even flat out rude to me when I asked to find the elevator when we first walked in!    The amenities were closed at odd hours (Starbucks closed at 4:00pm and no restaurants open after 8:00pm) and the service we received from staff was as if they had no interest in making our experience a good one.    We will not be returning!
50,Great experience. It was well worth it for the anniversary. Haven’t been to Las Vegas in a while. But it was worth it for the hotel room and the blue man group. Nice to go back after all the Covid restrictions. Looked about the same amount of people as before Covid
10,The hotel was not at the same caliber as the other hotels I’ve stayed at in the area. Our room was filthy when we first checked in and we had to wait in an extremely long line for over an hour to get a new room. No one cleaned our room on one night of our stay and even after we asked for someone to clean the room at the desk. It took over two hours for someone to finally arrive and we were preparing for bed at that point. All of the bathrooms at the casino were disgusting and the line for reservations/waitlist to eat at any of the restaurants in the hotel were absurd. The pool area was also dirty the water was murky and there were many particles/bandaids/clumps of hair floating in it. All in all it was one of the worst stays I’ve experienced in Vegas. Not worth the money.
20,The pyramid is in need of repair room air conditioning almost nonexistent shower terrible elevators(inclinators) rattling apart- wall Panels falling roller flat spots. Hdmi wall adapters inop room supplies a joke
10,Came to the Luxor on a birthday vacation and to say the least we are very unhappy with how it went. Started with the valet as soon as we got there scamming us for 30$ and was followed by horrible rooms and rude staff.
10,This was the worst hotel I have stay in during my travel experience….. their other properties are good but the pyramid is not a good hotel to stay in I feel like I took a trip to the past…. It was like I was in 1979
20,We used to stay there 10 years ago. It was sad to see how dirty overall it was. It just seemed like there could be a fight or something break out at any time. For us it was depressing and we checked out after only 1 day. Check in took an hour. We did eat at the mexican restaurant there and it was excellent.
30,Our room was nice and clean. Decent view. Just wish it wasn't such a far walk to everything. Also wish more things were open later. Coming back from gambling at wondering the strip even at midnight. Nothing is up for a bite to eat
20,Rooms in pyramid have old furniture and curtains. Hotel hallways reeked of weed. LONG walk from the elevator to our corner room. The casino nice.  NO shade at the pool unless you want  to spend $150 to rent an umbrella for the day. Do yourself a favor and stay at another property.
30,It was an average stay at an average resort. Nothing special but also nothing wrong with it. The cafe was good and a quick spot for breakfast food court was very over priced ($50 for 3 fast food slices of pizza a few garlic knots and 3 sodas). Casino was right but that was to be expected after covid.
10,room was terrible with cologne smell left from previous guest that lingered 3 of the 4 days staying there closet mirror door had broken hinge and handed out & carpet wet from A.C unit.    parking was not the greatest either and only place to find food late at night was a very small 24 hour shop that was crowded with a ton of people late at night with 12$ bad pre-made sandwiches.    5/6 members of the staff interacted with though were super friendly and very helpful. only one member at the front desk seemed to have an attitude and didn't seem to be too nice. but the other 5 staff members definitely made up for the one bad apple. staff gets a 10/10 but because of parking room etc will not be staying again at the luxor most likely.
20,check-in process is TERRIBLE check-in starts at 3pm the workers don't show up until 3pm and spends 20 mins wiping down computers while you've been standing in line for 55 mins.    A/C does not cool room properly called 3 times still wasn't fixed.    Trash overflowing in the hallways and throughout the entire property.    Vending machine (Pepsi machine) takes your credit card payment of $3 then let's you know it's empty no way to get your credit refunded.    DEFINITELY WON'T BE BACK!
20,Wallpaper peeling off the walls. Moving walkways never working. Extremely hot inside the building. Room safe was locked and couldn’t use it. Hotel room thermostat was way off on temperature. Pools are too shallow (seriously nothing deeper than 3.5 feet?). All the pool waterfalls are shut off. It’s like the Luxor management has no interest in fixing crap.
20,Horrible wifi no coffee maker in the room. Self parking was 2 miles away in 110 degree weather. Las Vegas is back but there weren't enough employees around to help. The hotel felt tired and old and the beds were not the greatest.
50,Had a great stay at the Luxor the Pyramid cafe isn’t worth your money though we went there 2 times and both time we were unsatisfied with the food or the service but Luxor was very nice if you stay here try the backstage deli 100% worth your money and good food. Will be staying at Luxor again
50,I'm from Phoenix and even thou vegas was hotter than Phoenix this week. We went up to get out of Phoenix. My friends and I wanted to spend time together and not in Phoenix. We work when we are at home .
40,Our room smelled of cigarettes which didn't bug us but wasn't ideal since we requested a smoke-free room. The AC wasn't adjustable but we were only there to sleep and shower. Overall great service and great price.
50,Happy to have stayed there. The design of the building is magnificent. It is unique experience. Rooms are comfortable. You do not hear any noise. You can rest inside your room and enjoy outside of it.
40,The rooms were Clean and good staff would recommend this hotel. Restaurants were excellent would eat there even if I did Not stay there. Wish tables had 10 limits but hard to find in Las Vegas now a days.
50,Spent half our trip at Ceasars Palce and have at Luxor. Even though we had a suite at Luxir i had low expectations. Wow what a great experience!! When we left our room fir the first time housekeeping stopped me and asjed if out toom was ok and if we needed anything. Cocktail servers wwre plentiful. They removed empty glasses as they delivered drinks. Employees alwsys cleaning machines and casino floir. Had a great meal at Tendor Steakhousr. Will be back
10,The entire hotel is very worn and not kept-up well. Good luck contacting anyone for service... tried calling front desk multiple times and was left on-hold for 30+ min before I hung up (on multiple occasions/times). Also be prepared to spend $7 for a coffee $3 for a water or $5 for a gatorade... not worth it.
10,Dusty hotel and old rooms. The hotel  Need upgrade and the carpet from the rooms are the worst. Also when you arrive to the rooms you don’t feel as a room hotel. However  the front desk staff was Amazing and the shift manager too. Hotel staff are the best
30,horribleee service  broken beds  clogged shower  room cards kept locking us out of our room  no one came to change our sheets or towels after being asked plenty of times. only thing we liked was a little shop inside. and even then the other workers at other shops were so rude.
10,Worse experience in vegas will never return! The room had cockroaches and security guards were racist and unorganized! They did not let me take pictures of the hotel after I paid over 700 dollars for two rooms.
40,Pros: Not as crowded as other hotels further on the strip amazing pool awesome bell desk employees connected to Mandalay Bay  Cons:No fridge in the room took forever to find our room no coffee except at the restaurants $40 resort fee added each night
10,This hotel has gone down hill over the last few years. I used to stay here very often. On this trip my wife tripped twice on the torn flooring in the parking garage elevator. When arriving in the room there were wet towels behind the door that were obviously left by the maid. In the afternoon the water was shut off without any prior notice. The bathroom sink was clogged and the room and hallways had a musty odor. This was part of the “recently renovated” area. If you drive a car there watch out for the numerous speed bumps while trying to get to the parking garage. A few are ok but 15 of them in half a block? Two where positioned a foot apart at a stop sign. I think the stop sign would have been sufficient. On my next trip to Vegas I will not be staying at the Luxor as there are many better choices.
20,The pyramid hotel was a cool idea but the whole place felt like it was stuck 20 years i the past. Very dated. The rooms were meh for the price. And the elevators reminded me of final destination as in I thought I might die on them.
50,First vacation since this pandemic started and it was great to be back in Vegas. The hotel room was clean the staff were amazing as always. And the wait line for check-in was relatively short. Only a small nitpick it was not as easy as it used to be to find a waitress for drinks. That being said it was fun and great to be back!
40,Not bad. Satisfied. A bit expensive. It bothered that paying almost 1000$ And not to have a fridge in room  To put more supplies in room will respect the guest. A booked room for 4 people its bad to have just two shampoo and one conditioner. But. Very happy. No complains
30,The rooms were horrible. Showers in both rooms did not drain room dirty the door wouldn’t close unless it was slammed shut. That then woke other members if the family. This was my daughters 30th BD!
10,Hotel more like a motel place was dirty smelled sheets were stained staff tricks you into tipping more for a “faster” service the A/c doesn’t work sweated all night ! Save your money don’t book this place !
30,Rooms was as luxurious as the outside and lobby appearance. Rooms did not have microwave nor mini fridge. They were just average rooms. I was disappointed with the rooms and how far you had to go to ger to your rooms on the East Tower. Entirely too far and felt unsafe!!!!
50,Overall a great and very unique hotel. Even though you can tell the Luxor isn’t brand new anymore it got the job done for a quick Vegas trip. Plenty of food and drink options loved the layout of the mail levels featuring different attractions. Can’t wait to visit again!
10,Wouldn’t recommend this place to anyone. I cannot stress enough how it felt like I was inconveniencing them by being there. This will be my very last time ever at this resort. It’s a shame too as I used to love the Luxor.
30,In our guest rooms there was a broken hanger two light fixtures that weren't working our remote didn't work areas that hadn't been cleaned well and we found items left over from previous guests. The inclinators were dirty and showed obvious signs of disrepair (broken panels handrails). Slot machines were dirty with no wipes or visible staff to clean them.
10,See anywhere else! They oversold my room. I was mysteriously locked out of my room. Given an incorrect room floor. Just hellacious! Run run run very far! Stay next door at the Excalibur. Again run run run far away!
40,My family and I are local. We decided to take a last minute trip on the Fourth of July. I was pleasantly surprised by the room. It was clean and in good shape. The location of Luxor on the strip is great for families. There’s a lot to do within walking distance of the hotel.
50,Friendly staff overall. The Room was very clean with all the utilities needed for our stay. . My son enjoyed his stay on his birthday! We will be back again. Thanks for making my family stay wonderful.
30,Prepare to wait in line for close to 1.5 hours just to check in. We paid for early check in and found out they have a QR Code thats FREE for everyone when you arrive. Walk way from garage is hard to breathe and extremely hot and humid! Charged for parking. Advertised as FREE and not! Starbucks is ridiculously overpriced!!! Pool water was warm to hot.
40,"The Luxor has been around a long time. It would not be a stretch to describe it as a Vegas icon. In recent years it seems to have picked up a reputation as a lower-end property but I'm happy to report that this image didn't match my recent experience.    The room while not particularly luxurious was better than expected--it was spacious and clean with plenty of towels and bedding for my small group. Everything worked as it should and the ""new"" furniture (which came from the Bellagio after their recent spruce-up) was in fine condition and actually looked very nice. Dining choices were plentiful (Diablo's was especially tasty) and several entertainment options were presented: two museum-quality exhibitions (Bodies and Titanic) one traditional Vegas-style topless revue (Fantasy) and the Carrot Top comedy show (which we attended) all with reasonable pricing.    I have to throw in a word about Carrot Top: I was not a big fan before the show (I had seen him on television a few times and knew who he was that sort of thing) but he won my friends and I over in a big way. The word-of-mouth is right this guy was HILARIOUS from start to finish and not afraid to step on a few toes including my own! I have no idea how he pulls off the ""finale"" every night but whatever he's being paid MGM is definitely getting their money's worth from him. If you're staying at the Luxor there's really no excuse for missing this. Next time I'm in Vegas I'm going back even if I end up staying elsewhere. He's that funny.    As to the staff they were fantastic; the property just needs more of them. Every staff member I interacted with (there were several) was top-notch and very helpful when we had a couple of issues. In fact my one and only issue with the stay was the wait time for the front desk during check-in and check-out; on at least one occasion we turned around and went back up to our room to call instead (which then led to us going right back down to talk with someone in person). It's my understanding that MGM has cut staffing at their properties--this needs to be fixed and quickly. While guests have become accustomed to long lines in Vegas especially during holiday weekends having only a handful of personnel manning the desk is a textbook example of being penny-wise and pound-foolish. They're obviously making a real effort to bring the Luxor closer to its former glory but all that work will be for nothing if guests have to wait an hour in line to talk to someone."
10,The ac in our room was not working we made several attempts and waited several hours for someone to come to our room to fix the ac. We were not offered a room switch we were told someone would be out which never happened. It was hot and uncomfortable to sleep in. I would say poor customer service.
50,Luxor is a great hotel. I personally do like the tower rooms better than the pyramid rooms. This was our 3rd time staying there. Would be great if there was a small arcade or something. We will definitely stay there again.
40,Luxor is a nice resort to stay at. I can’t say anything bad besides not having a fridge or microwave in the room. Other than that the staff accommodated our needs and I slept peacefully. Best sleep I got in a while.
50,I stayed in a renovated room. I loved the smell of the new carpet. The staff was great when we needed more towels. I would recommend the Luxor as a hotel to stay at. It has just enough of everything. The restaurants were great too.

30,The ice machines don’t work on most floors called front desk several days but never fixed. The A/C went out in our room for several hours. I wouldn’t recommend staying in the cheaper older rooms of the hotel. It’s possible the more expensive upgraded rooms might have provided a better experience.
30,Rooms were warm. Ac didn't cool properly. Found an old woman's bathing suit on top of the armour. At the end of the strip far from entertainment. Elevators were extremely worn out. The shook the whole way up and down.
40,The casino and bar areas were good as were the restaurants. The room was supposed to be the renovated pyramid room which didn't seem renovated at all. The ac barely worked. If you are a military member or a veteran ensure to ask about free parking at the front desk as I missed out on it

10,Staff did not care about issues we were having at all or offer any assistance! Very disappointing! We spent over $300 on two pool days. The first day was amazing but the second day we went almost 4 hours without seeing our cabana host for water and ice (it’s supposed to be every hour to hour and half). When we spoke to staff they did not care one bit even though the couple behind us ended up passing out from dehydration and heat related issues. Our floor on the 14th floor was constantly leaking something from the floor above us. We had no house keeping for 2 days. I approached a lady in the hall and asked for towels and she told me no because she would have to go downstairs to get more towels to cover the rooms on the floor. Lastly upon check in we were informed to visit the front desk for a military discount program. However when we spoke to someone they told us there was nothing they could do! Very disappointing on so many levels.
50,It was awesome. The room was awesome the sportsbook was awesome the pool was awesome. The dealers were amazing. It was easy to check in. We will definitely stay at any MGM property next time we are in Las Vegas.
20,our air didn't work. asked the front desk twice for it to be fixed and it never was. it was 93 degrees in our room at night. took a photo to document. miserable for july 110 temp. we left 1 night early because we couldn't deal with it.
10,Shower drain was plugged. We didn't shower because we didn't want water to overflow into bath room. We also didn't want our feet in dirty water. It took a couple of days of maintenance to show up and clean the drain. He left the basin dirty from the grease hair and whatever else came up from the drain. We didn't want to shower in a dirty basin. No maid ever showed up to clean the basin.
10,I did not get checked into my room after flying 12 hours until 4A.M!!! I arrived at 9 p.m. My room was rundown and deteriorating. I'll be posting a video and complete review on July 10 2021. Eve Jordan Litchfield
10,Overall the trip was horrible the staff unprofessional and rude the rooms and hotel area was dirty food was gross and expensive money was a waste I’ll never return being there for a wedding I was not pleased at all with Any of it
30,Room didn’t come with safe microwave or refrigerator. This hotel is Located near the end of the strip if you are trying to stay in the middle of the action I would recommend a hotel near the center of the strip.
10,Bed is very uncomfortable. The room is not cleaned right. The parking is difficult and nothing is right. This was a bad experience for a 1 bedroom suite. It was not worth the line with the extra 39 resort fee.
10,I specifically asked for a North facing room and walked into a room that faced South! The room never cooled down for the entire 4 night stay!!! I didn't dare open the curtains to look out at the Mandalay Bay buildings for fear that I would be scorched by the sun...
10,Room we booked wasn’t available no comp had to settle for another room. Graffiti all over the restrooms elevators and some machines. Cocktail waitresses were scarce and had to be hunted down. Buffett was closed down as well.
30,Overall the stay was good. At least a 10-15 minute wait for staff to answer when calling the front desk. Room was clean and spacious. Restaurants were average and not worth the money. Over priced but in line for Las Vegas.
10,The room and bathroom wasn't clean. Their was hair on the beds and the bathtub was dirty and the shower head hair in it. My family have the same kind of problems in their rooms. with the ac not working right or the tv.
20,Room was not clean housekeeping manager came saw complaint and did nothing. Also felt that I was overcharged. I would not recommend the luxor to my friends or family. Also they did not have enough bell men staff for the morning shift.
50,Absolutely wonderful place to vacation! Staff was awesome they didn’t a great job from checking us in to keeping our rooms clean even when we told them that they didn’t have to it was done anyway that was greatly appreciated!!
50,the entire facility was clean and staff were very friendly and accomodating. we had access to great food. game room was excellent and new machines were exciting to explore. Sports booking area with their new app is an excellent tool for on the go betting!
40,We celebrated my wife's birthday and our anniversary. We had pets and surprising enough the rooms were not in the smoking area. Most hotels would put you and your pets in an area that is not the most clean. Most of the times is in smoking areas.
10,Older hotel dirty sheets rough beds. Restaurant staff was very rude. Lack of food availability. Rooms are outdated. Checked in on mobile app. Waited for room for an hour then staff had to correct it.
50,Clean and safe staff where very nice a lot of different types of food rooms smelled clean and looked clean and also there shows where amazing had a grate time at the blue man group show recommend if you stay here
20,We have always come to the Luxor when we came to Vegas. Since the pandemic the hotel has gone down hill. Was not impressed at all and ran into a lot of issues on the first night of arriving. I hope they get it together.
20,My very first time in vegas was a total nightmare. My 2 complimentary nights ended up me using only 6hours of it and I paid for the room full price but then on my Mlife account my 2comp room was from 30-02 and I paid $150 on June 30-01 just to stay at the room
10,This hotel use to be a wonderful fun place. The staff are all too busy to help you. They simply do not have time for anything. They are very rude if you have any questions. Our room was so dirty. Mold growing on the outside of the shower. Shower leaked everywhere. Sink wouldn’t drain. Ceiling had cracks and holes. The walls have cracks as well. The chairs had tears. Beds were comfortable though. Our room stayed between 73-76. We could not get it to cool down. Our complaints were useless. There are no coffee machines or microwaves in the room. Getting a coffee will take at least 30 minutes. Everything was so price gouged that it made things really difficult. We had to go eat other places. $25 for a simple hamburger…crazy. Stay somewhere else. You have been warned.
50,We had a lovely stay at the Luxor hotel. It was with an easy walking distance to the strip. The rooms were clean and relatively quiet. The casino was nice however it smelled pretty strongly of smoke. Overall a very enjoyable trip.
50,We thank you very much everything was very good we had to move 2 they upgrade room at Water problems floor wet and and AC did not cool down properly we did receive a upgrade room which was very nice thank you
20,I returned to this hotel after many years because we booked via the airline. I was very disappointed in the lack of upgrades in the room and throughout the hotel. The service for the the rooms was very poor and the rooms were not properly clean. The best part of the hotel is the pool.
50,I looked up reviews after booking and I was a little nervous at first after experiencing it for myself (with 3 kids) it was great staff was friendly and very good atmosphere to be around. The pros out weighed the cons. Now no hotel is perfect but expectations were high and they fulfilled everything I expected
20,Extremely rude bell hop. No coffeemaker in the room. Very slippery shower floor with no handles to catch or steady yourself. Very very tiny shelf in the shower that wouldn't fit all items for one person. Four people in the room and only 3 towels and 2 wash cloths were given. No available parking had to park next door.. Just an awful experience.
10,(1)Hair was in the large white tub by the window. (2)The metal cover for access to I would assume pipes under the large white tub was nearly falling off. (3)The fridge was hot when we entered the room for the first time.(4) In the middle of the night someone came by and knocked on our door and when we answered the door nobody was there in essence someone was doing the good ole ding dong ditch trick(I`m almost 40 years old) we notified the front desk and they said they would be sending security up we never stayed by the door to see if anyone came or not.(5) Last but not least we had to track down the maid service for wash clothes due to the fact we had zero although when we called the front desk & laundry nobody answered the phone maybe given it was right around check in time I believe it was 1530hrs when we initially entered the room we ended up. We had to track them down again for 4 more wash clothes the next morning.(6) When we booked the room my wife accidently clicked the room without the veteran discount and when we came down the next morning to inquire about getting the right rate for the room I was told my the front desk it was my fault I booked it that was and they would not honor my military veteran status. I presented my ID to the front desk to provide proof of me being military veteran. What is crazy is the all this happened in the course of 20hours since check in is at 1500 and check out is 1100. I will not being staying with Luxor in the future! Thank you in advance for your time and consideration into this matter!
10,Room was dirty. Someone's fake eye lash in bathroom even after I left message for it to be cleaned. Only two bath towel no wash rag or hand towels. No secured wifi and unsecured had no signal anyway.  TV didn't work. No fridge or coffee pot. Places to eat weren't open long at all. Place is a dump.
10,No privacy sign for the door. The safe was locked so we were not able to use it. There is no refrigerator in the room. The carpets were old. Biggest problem is no WiFi so unable to work. Had to drive off the property to a Starbucks to get signal
50,Our daughter doesn't usually travel with us when we visit Vegas but this time she did. She my nephew and his friend really enjoyed the E-Sports arena. It gives the younger crowd something fun to do while parents gamble a little.    Our room was spacious and decorated nicely very modern. This was our first stay at the Luxor and it won't be our last.
40,I got a complimentary room from the app MyVEGAS Slots and I was a bit skeptical but it turned out to be way better than I expected. The resort fee wasn’t crazy expensive. The only real problem is being sure to get the direction for your room and if it’s a mobile app you’re using this might be a challenge for some.
40,Mobile Check in was a bit confusing but room was great. Checked in via mobile and got email confirmed checked in. The day of check in got another email to check in again. Casino table was limited. Blackjack only pays 6/5.
30,A decent selection of table and slot machines. There could be a better or I should say newer variety of slot machines to keep up with some of the other casinos in Vegas.    The renovated rooms are so much brighter and cleaner.    There are other parts of the resort that could use updates and or cleaning but I think that might be coming soon.    We have stayed in both the towers and pyramid and they are nice rooms with comfortablebeds.
10,Not worth your money. Stay elsewhere. Hotel rooms are so outdated and feel dirty. Air conditioning is so weak you won’t sleep well. Bed is lumpy and uncomfortable. One of the worst hotels on the strip.
10,If you want a outdated hotel with mold this is your place. The hotel location is not bad but you are on the end of the strip. Very noisy from hallway traffic and slow seating for cafe. Dirty casino and hotel carpets. The app use of digital check in or out is nice but you can not do much else.
40,Over all the resort was very nice but the room bathroom shower was hazardous and caused an injury to my guest. The staff and security were great. But the design of the bathroom was very unpleasant and I was not satisfied with the stay.
50,Download the MGM app for easy check in and check out process skip the front desk line the line can get long with guests checking in and out. So i would utilize the express check out by elevators as well ..Clean room. No problem happened during our stay.
10,Went to stay at the Luxor for 3 nights and wished I would of picked somewhere else. The smell of marijuana filled my room the whole time there. Warm beer at two bars I went to. The casino needs a facelift. All I can say it was dirty. I will spend a dollar more to stay somewhere else.
30,Trash left in hallway all weekend and beware when taking a shower that you flood the bathroom floor all the time. They have no sliding door but a half door on the wrong side of the shower. It needs to be on the back end so when water falls to the shower area.
20,"We had 2 different people walk in to our room at 11:30 at night without knocking or announcing ""housekeeping maintenance"" or whatever else and there were no dead bolts or those locks that fold over the door that we could have used. We were not informed that our water would be shut off from 11 or 12noon until 2 or 3 in the afternoon. When we tried to call the front desk we waited on the phone for someone to answer for a 1/2 hour before giving up and just hanging up. We felt like a lot of places to eat closed really early or were only open at odd times. There was no fridge to put water in so we figured we would get ice and fill the sink but the ice machine was broken. The upside was the room was beautifully renovated clean and the beds were super comfy."
10,Real lousy check in. App didnt work. Waiting on staff for help. Luxor cancelled my room after 2 nites. Was originally offered 4 nites ...requested 3 nites. Understaffed. Frustrating stay. Called after the stay. Casino host was no help as well! Been staying at Luxor for over 15 years...no more. Our company will go elsewhere.
40,It smelled like weed pretty bad. We didn’t really want to be in the room much because of the smell of weed. So sleeping at night was not the greatest experience due to the weed smell. I wish we could’ve gotten switched because it was a bad odor
30,I was unpleasantly surprised to find that you now need to pay up to $30 per day to park here. I won't be back. Also I brought a few soft drinks and was shocked that there was no mini-fridge in the room. I called the front desk and was told you have to pay $25 extra if you want a fridge!! I feel bad for people that have medications that need to be refrigerated. Also there was no coffee maker in the room. When I asked about getting one I was told that you have to stay in a suite to get a coffee maker.
30,Close to strip. Rooms were a little outdated and had some plumbing issues. Toilet didn’t flush properly and sink clogged occasionally. Hotel areas Pool casino restaurants were excellent. Overall worth the economic price.
20,No Reimbursement for my Dad room was robbed cigarettes Meds they even took left over food toilet seat we're lucky we didn't fall off very loose  exhaust fan very noisy TV channels horrible 3 pillows should have 4 on a King size bed
10,We came to the Luxor to celebrate our anniversary and my college graduation. It is also the Fourth of July weekend. We had nothing but problems our whole stay at the Luxor. After checking in and getting to our room in the West tower we discovered that the tv and sink didn’t work and the lock on our bathroom door was broken. We called immediately( this is around 11:50am-12:45pm) we also asked for extra towels. Towels didn’t arrive until 2pm. And we didn’t have the tv or sink looked at until 7pm. That is the whole day! I understand that they had a waiting list of people to have things fixed in their rooms and one maintenance man but I feel that these things should be checked when the previous people leave so that this isn’t a problem. Even after having the tv looked at it didn’t work properly the entire stay. The connection would cut out randomly while watching tv and take a while to come back on. The pool has a sewage smell near it and was filled with Garbage and straws.Also we received towels with stains on them. And on the last day found a tiny roach on one of the towels we were given. This was about 2 hours before checkout. After calling to inform the front desk they offered 50 dollars off our dinner. Exhausted and in a rush to leave I said fine. We booked our last night at the Mirage to quickly get out of there. And if anything my stay at the Mirage only made it more clear how terrible and unacceptable the problems we dealt with at the Luxor were. I will not be returning
20,We were greeted by debris on the floor a boiling hot room and a moldy shower door. We adjusted the temperature on the thermostat and waited. It took more than 6 hours to get the room to 82 degrees. We called the desk and they said they were sending someone to look at it. We waited several hours and they never showed.
30,Room stayed warm and never got below 72* although it was set on 68. Shower and sink backed up quickly when used which made normal bathroom activities a challenge. Didn't get checked in as early as we paid for and had to go to the front desk multiple times to get everything lined out as agreed originally. Restaurants were expensive and the quality of food wasn't great. Buffet was closed. Casino is great and the blue man group was exceptional as always.
10,Water went out was moved to another room. Restaurants not open so not much selection.  No wash cloths.  Air conditioner did not cool down room.  Long line in getting complaint taken care of.  When called front desk no one answered phone calls.
30,Nothing stood out. Price wasn't that great service was good no poker games at all so spent alot of time outside of the casino. Food was ok but oretty pricey. Had a $35 steak that tasted like a $10 steak.
20,Everything was great except for room air conditioner didn’t work. Called maintenance and they never came. They didn’t have any other rooms. Also drain wouldn’t drain in shower. I was a bit upset That they never came to fix. It was really hot.
50,Took the family and had a wonderful week. The Pyramid cafe was underwhelming but Diablos exceeded our expectations! I wish there were more food options. The pool and cabanas were awesome shame we were rained out. Be warned that despite advertising you cannot use the pool at mandalay bay... we got refused entry.
50,Great location really pleasant and clean rooms but the thing that makes this such as good place to stay are the staff. The only thing i don't like is the self parking not included. It should be free to the guest who stay in the hotel of Luxor.
40,Bathroom wasn’t clean upon entry and rooms weren’t cleaned consistently. We ran out of toilet paper and it took hours to have them bring toilet paper. We constantly had to request towels for our room. We even asked the cleaning lady who told us we would have to call to request towels
30,Illegally charging resort fees and rooms are dated in the pyramid. All other casinos are in walking distance we walked the whole strip down to circus circus and back nice walk got to see and experience alot.
10,Our room was old and dirty. The carpet was not clean. Rain leaked into our room and they told us that nothing could be done. There was no hair dryer or refrigerator. The lights were out over our room so we could not see how to open our door!
40,I stayed for two nights. I got a small room upgrade which was nice. The front desk person was new but she did awesome. The room was nice and clean and housekeeping was also very nice. I will be going back.
50,Rooms were clean and comfortable. Casino is the right size with plenty of games to choose from. The indoor walkways to Mandalay bay and Excalibur is a plus when it is over 100 degrees outside. Had a great stay. View from our window on the 17th floor
40,Great stay reasonable price overall good experience. Thought the room could've been a bit cleaner as the in room spa tub had hair in it still but overall a good and friendly experience. I would definitely recommend
30,I want to mention it was disappointing not to be able to use my Starbucks gift cards while staying. Coffee is very important for my sanity and I kept getting caffeine headaches because I could not get my coffee in the morning.
20,Far away from the strip rooms outdated boring pool not even a Dj or even speakers with music playing only fast food options available just a run down old hotel if you want to do Vegas cheap this is the place if you want luxury go else where..
40,My biggest complaint is the people who constantly bother you about doing a promotional 2 hour meeting. That’s fine but once I say no or even do the thing…leave me alone. I want to enjoy my vacation and not be bothered.
50,We were in town for volleyball nationals. Our experience far exceeded my expectations. I had visited the hotel in the past never stayed and I wasn’t impressed. Having stayed there for 3 nights I would definitely stay at the Luxor again. Tower room was big clean and a bed I was able to sleep in which doesn’t often happen at hotels. Staff was helpful and friendly. Easy walk to 5 surrounding resorts. Highly recommend
50,Our room had the best view over the city! We enjoyed the view from the large run Oberon of the window on the 30th floor. We will definitely be staying here again. Our towels were replaced and shampoo replaced everyday before we returned that evening.
20,The air conditioning in the rooms are not what I expected in a place like this. I tried to lower the temperature but the room would not cool down. Also the fan has 3 settings and they all blew almost the same. I had a fan brought up to the room which helped a little but overall would say I was still not completely satisfied.
40,I did not choose to stay at the Luxor it was kind of chosen for me. It would not have been my first choice due to it being located at the end of the strip however it turned out to be better than I thought. I do not require first class accomodations when I travel just a reasonably priced clean functional room. This one fit my demands and I only had a few issues with my stay. The first is that the bed was hard. It was definately not soft and snuggly. I don't mind a hard bed so I slept well but it was obviously a very cheap mattress. The second thing is that the towels are not soft but rough. They dry you off just fine but after spending time in the Las Vegas sun they can be a bit ouchy. The third thing is that the view could have been wonderful but the windows were dirty. Since they are what forms the pyramid it is possible they can't keep them clean I'm not sure. The fourth thing was the tv...when you turn it on the volume always resets and it blasts the sound this is annoying at 2 am...and the remote is slow to respond. Also be very careful about the adult movie channels. If you press the buttons for the 24 hour movie package you spend $22 immediately and there are no refunds. There is no preview or further information before purchasing...it is immediate. This is extremely decieving and I'm betting they make quite a bit of money off of people mistakenly pushing the button. The hotel made no bones about the fact that there were no refunds for it... they didn't even pause to consider. As far as the casino and getting around the hotel it was nice and we enjoyed it. The elevators show up fast and it is kind of cool that they move sideways as well as up and down.
10,We were not told until we checked into the room that the water would be completely turned off in the room all week from 12 pm to 2 pm. It was a big inconvenience for our family of 6 and 2 hotel rooms.
10,Don’t bother trying to get any help from this manager. He needs to be let go as he has no clue about customer service. The hotel does not guarantee any room you book and then laugh when you show your booking.
50,First time staying at the Luxor in a few years. Was able to check in right away. Staff was friendly and helped me get settled in and start having fun. I really like that I can enjoy a Cigar in the Casino.
30,This stay was gifted to my wife and I for our honeymoon. The best part about he hotel was the Titanic museum. No restaurants were really open besides the small food court and Diablos. I wish I had a better time and I really wanted to love this hotel. The only way I would consider going back would be to purchase a suite but not for the money and a small amount of amenities. I understand Covid had an impact on our overall stay.
30,Room didn't have a fridge in it. We purchased drinks and didn't have anyway to keep them cold. And any leftover food went bad if we didn't eat it right away. Vegas is known for its nightlife we were woken up every day by housekeeping wanting to clean our room.
10,Property was dirty and wasn't even at full capacity so you would think they would make extra effort to provide a great experience to the guest - elevators unsafe with exposed wire - Water was turned off each day I was there from 12-3 pm with out being told that was going to happen.
10,Room was “unavailable” at check in. Staff did offer to comp resort fee which was nice. Housekeeping barged into room both mornings of our stay abruptly waking us up. The bathroom was only partially clean. Overall this was not a healthy place to stay.
40,This was third stay at Luxor. Very friendly staff. Myself and all my friends like the hotel. Food was great. Easy access to hotel. Mask was optional. Security staff was everywhere. Slot machines and table games were clean and all staff was wearing mask.
50,Stay was short yet sweet. Our kids enjoyed the pool and comfy beds. We’ll definitely be coming back! Only weird thing was we had to pay for parking $18 per night to self park which isn’t too bad but still weird since other hotels don’t charge for self park.
50,Wonderful rooms and good options…Bar was lit…Good music selections…Good restaurants options..Starbucks tram across street to get to strip…Friendly staff they cleaned the room the entire stay every day.
10,I stay in hotels 2 weeks of every month for work and travel. The room I stayed in was to the standard of a drug motel in a rough city. The house keeping lady came into room multiple times during my 4 night stay without even giving a courtesy knock to let you know someone was coming in at one time I was even half naked in the process of putting on clothes from getting out of the shower.
40,You get what you pay for at this hotel. I’ve been a few times and will go again because of the good rates. Quality of the rooms is not high-end with odd odor and cigarette burns. The bed is comfortable. Casino is great - love the Egyptian theme. My scores are all a reflection of the hotel because all other aspects of Luxor are 4-5 stars.
50,Thank you so much for a fantastic stay. The staff was amazingly helpful and friendly. This was my first stay at the Luxor I usually stay at Bellagio. But my expectations were exceeded and there was very little difference in the quality of the properties and Luxor is a better deal
50,The Luxor makes you feel right at home! Best service in vegas! From housekeeping to the pool service this place killed it! Don’t miss the blue man group as they put on a performance of a life time! My kids love them and already want to go back and see them
30,Hopefully next time housekeeping will pay attention too detail and clean the room properly especially with what we have going on in this world other then my stay was ok and hope that next time the staff will be more understanding that without us guest who have choice of stay chose Luxor for a reason.
40,Our visit to the LUXOR was fun. The location is perfect for a first time trip to Vegas. The property definitely reminds visitors of Ancient Egyptian lifestyle I love it!    Overall price was affordable during the week.
30,My husband and I stayed at the Luxor for the first time (6/23-6/27). The hotel itself is very nice and the staff was great however the quality of the room in which we stayed was meh compared to a few of the other Vegas strip hotels we have stayed.The room was underwhelming.
50,Alrhough this facility is not the newest on the Strip it is unique and going through renovations. We stayed in one of their advertised newly renovated suites and it was well received. The Staff here excels when it comes to customer service and works very hard to make sure you are satisfied during your stay.
20,I am no hotel snob and I know what to expect whether staying at a higher-end hotel or a motel. I am so very disappointed at how rooms at the Luxor have been allowed to decline. I was however very pleased with the friendliness of the staff and the upkeep of the casino and restaurants. There are also many restaurant selections for every budget. Previous stays at the Luxor were great but the rooms hallways and elevators are in desperate need of renovations. I will not be staying here ever again due to my most recent experience.
40,Affordable clean rooms for a hotel on the Strip. Digital check in is a plus on arrival you can head straight to your room. Bummer finding out you have to pay for parking when you have booked a room at this hotel. Overall it was a good experience not the best not the worst.
10,The check in process was a pain. We were in line and a lady with a tablet took us out and said she could check us in faster. That was not the case. It took over 45 mins just to get our keys. The hotel rooms have no fridge or microwave. Huge disappointment since we were there 7 nights. Had to spend lots of money on food which is probably what they wanted. When I walked into the room the floor was dirty. There were wrappers and trash on the floor. The bathroom sink drain had a horrible smell and there was hair on the shower floor and bathroom floor. I had a massage at their spa and was handed a key to the locker. I changed put on the robe and sat in the waiting area. Once I sat down I realized my robe was wet. I notified the staff immediately. They apologized multiple times and gave me a new robe. I’m assuming the robe I put on had just been used by someone else. I did enjoy my massage and facial. Due to the uncleanliness of my hotel room I will never stay at Luxor again and will tell my friends and family to stay somewhere else.
30,I loved the room and the building other than the room was listed as having a mini fridge and didn’t come with one. The lady at the 24/7 shop would not let me use my m life rewards card for the discount because she saw me pulling cash out of my pocket and instantly hit the cash out button on the register. Refused to accommodate either returning the item and reselling them to me under the card number or somehow finding a way to add the points I paid in cash I felt like it wouldn’t be that big of an issue. She just said “ no maybe next time” as if I was there for a long period of time or something.
10,Nothing but lies on the mgmresorts website. We traveled with our beloved pooch but because none of the services that were still listed on the website or available. One of us was stuck in the room with the mutt at all times. The Luxor doesn't even have a concierge desk anymore even though the website says it does. All they did is lie to us when we were saying what was available for our upcoming trip. I talked to the Bell desk as these people are usually the most knowledgeable what goes on in a hotel and were informed that services like that have not been available from even before the scamdemic was perpetrated on America. When we got to the room it had only one towel. No bath mats or face cloths or hand towels. Everything was grossly under done and they had even remove the refrigerators from the room. The air conditioning didn't work for squat we could not cool down the room. Live help and staff were few and far between at this hotel and Food Services were absolutely horrible. The worst part is MGM Resorts will never ever contact me to try to straighten any of the South is they only care about extracting money from their guests and leaving it at that
20,The air conditioning did not work. We were in west tower on floor 9 in a 2 queen room. First night they brought us a fan. Second night it was too hot in the room and they only had a king available so they moved us to the 12th floor and brought a rollaway bed because there were 3 of us. I also had a back to back reservation and they made me come down and get new keys but told me I wouldn't need to when I switched rooms. Was not very clean. Cracks in the tile on frame of shower and in hallways.
50,The beds were extremely comfortable. The rooms were spacious and clean. The check in procedure was very easy and the staff was pleasant. The only thing that I can think of that I wish was different is how far you have to walk to get to your room. There was only 1 elevator at the end of the hall and our room was at the complete opposite end.
20,I’ve had good experiences here in the past but I stayed in the pyramid section this time and had a poor experience. Check in took a very long time and my reserved room was swapped last minute to a much lower floor level (not a huge deal but still disappointing). Only 2 of the 6 elevators in my corner of the pyramid were operational and I either had to wait 20 minutes for an elevator or walk a fourth the distance of the perimeter of the pyramid to reach a different set of elevators. I paid for a corner suite which I expected to be a decent room. I was shocked that there was no security latch on the door no “do not disturb” door hanger no remote for either tv a broken air conditioner and a broken fridge. On the first night of my stay I was woken up in the morning by cleaning staff entering my room (no security latch). I expected sooo much more from a corner suite.
30,Had nothing but problems getting the suite we reserved. And then they switched us from the Towers (where the suite was to be) into the very dated pyramid. Stay away from the pyramid. The windows are so small and a tall person cannot even get close to them without bending down. That is why I originally purchased a suite in the Towers (where you have real windows). It took the hotel over 1.5 hours to finally get us the keys to the second-rate suite in the pyramid (after our digital key sent us to the wrong room).
20,I’m sure the Luxor was a nice hotel when it was built but it is getting very tired. The only benefit is that it is very cheap. However if you are hoping for a decent room I would look elsewhere. We had to stay as part of a tournament and moved as soon as we could.
30,We were forced by our club to stay at this hotel for the money i guesss you get what you pay for Hallways we’re extremely dirty and unkept rooms were on the low end of clean. Also the smoke was not filtered well my daughter had some rough nites breathing..
10,Sheets had spots. Dirty shower and stopped up sink. They sent Maintenance and housekeeping to my room at 1am instead of just moving me even if it was an upgrade. The trash in the hall by elevator was not changed for 2 days and smelled. Getting to the elevators (East or West) is a horrible maze! Don’t stay here! The one star is for the housekeeping lady who came up at 1am. She was a sweetheart. Other than that 0 stars!
10,3 of 4 elevators were broken leaving us to deal with huge lines just to get to our floor. Ac knob was loose so we would not adjust the ac to make it cooler. Tried to call and got nothing but non stop ringing at the front desk. Glad by resort fee was well spent! Will never stay here again.
20,Not a good hotel selection. I would go with New York New York or another property. It is at the north end of strip. The restaurant choices on property are mediocre. The bell staff is slow it takes them forever to answer phone at front desk
20,Staff: Only went to the front desk once (to finally complain) and staff member was nice understanding and kind. The two gentleman at cashier window were less than helpful. Not happy there. Cafe staff were great. Bartenders were hit and miss. The lady I asked for directions to the specific room elevator was rude and told me to look at my phone check-in for directions.    Check-in: Did everything online and prefer it that way. Easy and didn’t have to wait in line. Just pay attention to directions to the room since staff was less than helpful there.    Casino was fine. No issues. But the restaurants all seemed to close at 2:00 pm on a weekday except the food court which closed at midnight. Ended up eating only once here during our stay and had to find other places elsewhere.    And since when do hotel guests have to pay for valet?? Guess it’s been a while since I’ve been to Vegas.    Finally… The room(s) lacked amenities. No coffee maker no mini fridge not even an alarm clock. There was only one hook to place towels on and the clean ones were left on the counter which was dusty. The shower “door” was a joke. It was a half glass wall that did nothing to keep water in and we practically flooded the bathroom each time we showered. Had to use our towels to mop up the floor. Until the hotel shut the water off to our wing without notice. And finally the room was HOT! The air conditioner worked but the vent only had tiny slits and pointed towards the wall with very little fan power. We died the first night. Ordered a portable fan the next day which ended up being pointless as I finally complained and was moved to a new room. This new room was only slightly better. Semi colder. Still too hot to sleep. No amenities here either. But at least the shower had a full closing door and the tub was nice. Otherwise not much difference in comfort or amenities.    After all the issues the only help I got was a single night resort fee waiver. Paid over $300 for two nights to be mostly uncomfortable. Won’t be back.
50,The staff at this hotel are absolutely awesome. I recommend them and the luxury which the hotel is also extremely awesome￼. We were at the beginning of June and even though not everything in Las Vegas was open we didn’t lack for anything and the people that work at Lux or went out of their way to make her stay fabulous.￼
20,I have always wanted to stay on this side of the strip. Was excited to finally stay at the Luxor. Super disappointed I did for 4 days. Will never book here with my friends or family. Blood in 2 diff rooms tvs don't work showers are half open and drench the floors long elevator wait times no one answers the phone long lines at check in and don't bother calling security. We paid way too much for this bs. It was disappointing!
20,Room was very OLD and outdated the elevators are soooo slow the wait was over 20 mins. The air conditioner in the room was horrible. Mind you I had a suite. Calling guest services was a nightmare over 20 minute wait. They were sold out so I couldn’t switch rooms .
30,Luxor is a reminder of the wave in the 1990s to breathe new and exciting life into Vegas transforming it to more of a world-class tourist destination. When it was built the structure was like no other offering a unique and awe-inspiring icon on the iconic Vegas strip. It's kind of a shame how MGM's greed has allowed it to become nothing more than a soulless revenue source with very little investment to maintain any of the charm and excitement that were there when it opened only three decades ago.    Seeing the hotel's theme and unique structure provided a fun experience for my son when we arrived but the excitement waned pretty quickly. There is not much to entice guests to spend time on the property; a few generic gift shops over-priced fast food and a large but completely bland lifeless pool area. The rooms lack the basics one would expect in a strip resort ... like a refrigerator! Clunky elevators broken card readers rusty-looking lounges in the pool area are just a few examples of easily remedied problems that give the appearance of a neglected aging resort whose time has past which is a shame because the property is only about 30 years old. Customer service is non-existent. We ended up using Luxor as a home base and spent most of our time at nearby properties. This place is a shell of its former self wnd whil it may be fun to walk through that's about it. There's a reason room prices are so affordable here. Still ... if I am going to stay in Vegas I want more than crumbling reminders of the past. Next time we'll spend a few more bucks and try something different.
10,This used to be a very nice hotel and staff would go above and beyond to please their guests. Not any more this hotel has lost it chanted and great customer service. I will just go back to the Aria or Bellagio..
10,This place looks like it hasn't been remodeled since it was open and is one of the worst places I’ve stayed in vegas and I’ve stayed everywhere as I’m there often.    There wasn’t one good thing about the Luxor
40,Actually out of all the hotels I've stayed at This one I enjoyed alot not to pricey and pool is awsome. My one of my fave 2 hotels The Luxor and the Flamingo. Thanks alot for the experience and would definitely re visit even tho its far from alot I enjoyed it.
40,Great hotel with plenty to do and was a plus with a small mall inside  rooms where clean and location was good . Even seen a show in the hotel Was easy to get a taxi  would definitely go again to this hotel !
20,Rooms are decent however you either get no shower door or a shower door that breaks off. Also parking should be free for guest paying 40.00 resort fee. Pool is nice. Ac could use some work. Elevators could use some work
40,Nice hotel and staff was amazing. Rooms not so much. Bathroom was dirty and sink did not work. Casino floor has lots of games and tables. The buffet was still not open yet but hopefully next time. The pyramid had very good breakfast.
30,Hotel overall was ok staff was very friendly needs updating. Food delicious entertainment was on point. Elevators was questionable one stopped working it was stuck on the 13th floor. Every night their was a line just to get on.
30,"Luxor has the convenience of staying on the strip and having obvious gaming opportunities on site. And the shows/exhibits are nice. But the hotel is a little dated and threadworn and you don't get more than just a room. Except for the experience of staying ""on the strip"" and having tickets to Blue Man Group I'd have stayed at the HI Express 1 mile away gotten a bigger room breakfast included and just parked at Luxor for $15 for the day."
40,The room wouldn't cool down it was very small for what we paid it was humid after showers the drain in the sink didn't work there was a space for a refrigerator but it had been removed there was no coffee maker. We literally used it for the bed. Not my usual experience.
10,After working extra jobs to save for this trip I took my teen boys to las vegas to use the hyper x arena. We were unable to use it due to a private party rental. I had checked the website and it was not on the calendar! The girl at the arena was rude. Not enough staff at the hotel or the pool. Worst trip ever.
50,Quality stuff staying at the Luxor. Housekeeping was quick and responsive to my needs. Security was always present through the hotel and casino. Pools where nice and cool for the extreme weather. Overall a pleasant experience.
30,I love this hotel but the tv in room was fuzzy and the bell desk staff was kinda rude. It took over 3 hours to get pillows and they never brought my fridge for my meds after I called again.bell desk staff was rude when we tipped cause we tipped what we could afford and they don’t like that so he packed our bags crappy and everything fell out when we opened the trunk.
10,Worst experience ever! We were stuck in elevator for an hour and staff didn’t do a thing! To top it all off Room was horrible. Do not bother saving some money by staying at a MGM place. Find an alternate place MGM has been terrible to us!
10,Stayed at the Luxor for a volleyball tournament in town. Rooms were dirty - clearly not vacuumed in quite a while. The $30 daily “resort” fee paid for access to a dingy pool (which closed at 7 pm exactly when our teenage girls wanted to relax in the pool) and “high speed” internet wifi that did not connect except for early morning hours. The frozen yogurt shop in the lobby area closed in early evening - again exactly when a froyo treat sounded like a great idea. Needed to check out a day early when our volleyball team lost in the tournament and the hotel would not make any concession for us. Charged us for an extra day and claimed they were doing us a favor by not charging the $30 resort fee for the extra day. Whatever. Will never stay at Luxor again.
10,Grossly understaffed. Zero service like a ghost town. Won't answer phone EVER. Concierge didn't exist. A total mess with uncleaned common areas where french fries laid for days in the hallways. Water shut off in entire hotel for 3 hours in the middle of the day.
20,"Traveling with two kids we were checked into a smoking room/former smoking room. The response when calling to switch rooms was ""All of our rooms are non-smoking."" Just because the hotel is now non-smoking doesn't mean that smoke no longer exists. This was stale smoke as if when converting the smoking room to non-smoking drapes/carpet weren't changed. Lost an hour and dealt with many gripes having to relocate (with a full compliment of luggage) to the lobby and again to a new room. Never received my slot credit that came with the promo and could not fix it since the M-Life desk has banker's hours. Not at all impressed."
30,The hotel itself was very nice. The staff is helpful and friendly. The ac in the hotel rooms was not the best. The food in the restaurants inside the hotel were great. The entertainment inside the bars was great. We had a great time.
30,Better quality on the bathroom and drainI don’t have any else to saidjust check the room send someone to inspect the rooms before a customer get in the roomlike that the quality of service will be different and the survey will be excellent
50,Check in was awesome with the mobile check in. My room was clean and the shower was amazing the casino was great for how I like to gamble. There seemed to be plenty of places to eat at the hotel resort. And the pools seems extremely ice for me and my friends. I would recommend this resort to anyone. I would have like to see a little better comps but maybe that will come on my next visit.
20,We took a family trip and most of the time has to deal with issues. The room was not what was advertised the hotel could use an update the wallpaper was coming off and being held on my tape. I would not recommend this to anyone.
40,Overall experience was very good yet I must say that the security was on their job  because the seven days I stayed there I did not witness any altercations that got out of hand. And that is what I most observed at other hotels and casino on the strip security having a difficult times with non-guest. One of the security officers (Bethany) at the Luxor really was so professional and went beyond her duties to maintain a safe and friendly atmosphere for the guest is what I observed. Transitioning out of Covid-19 and for my 1st time in Vegas I'll be visiting the Luxor hotel again soon!
40,All this casino needs is a club other than that it was great stay. Nice clean rooms along with good customer service. Pricing was a bit high but still enjoyed my stay here. Definitely coming back and staying here again.
40,We had a blast at the Luxor and saved money on the stay using Expedia. Personally would stay there again. If you never been to Vegas look up the tram maps. Near all the major hot spots and restaurants are good inside..
10,First the put us in the wrong room from what we booked. The next room the gave us the water stopped working. When it started back the shower was overflowing. The air didn’t blow very cool. The elevator got stuck with people on it for an hour
10,The room was not clean we found a half empty beer bottle under the couch. The hotel has maintenance workers and two of them tried to enter our deadbolt locked room without knocking or calling. I told the front desk and said that the room is going out of service and they thought we left? We didn't check out yet! This hotel has no concern for your health or safety not worth it. Please stay somewhere else.
40,Overall everything was good. Staff nice and friendly. It was odd that we got 3 pillows instead of 4 and no do not disturb sign. However when we called and asked for it we got it without a problem. There is lots to do at the hotel and the food was good especially at the pyramid cafe.
10,The Luxor pre pandemic was alright. Fix your damn elevators (2b) and hire some more staff at front desk. Clean your floors and machines it was honestly disgusting to sit next to half empty drinks and freshly finished cigarettes
10,This hotel was very disappointing. Shut off water every day for hours No hot water Broken a/c no one answers the phone empty vending machines uneven floors just to name a few. Still had a great time....gambling and eating in other casinos.
50,Great place BUT if you eat on premises check the % of suggested tip that is printed for gratuity and make sure it is for the amount you ate and were charged... But the staff was awesome and food good.
10,There was feces on our bed upon check in. Plus pubic hair all over the bathroom. Feces were on the clean linens and had soaked through all protective layers of the bed. The bathroom had pubic hair all around the toilet around the shower doors and under the sink. Especially the area where they store the clean towels. Room smelled like cigarettes.
30,First time at the Luxor and I couldn’t find where to check in. Soon after they try to sell me a time share after. I’m not of age. Then my room didn’t come with fridge or microwave. For what I was paying I felt it could of been better.
10,Room was not what we booked no refrigerator poor air conditioning which took 3 days to be given a fan. Trip was booked March 2021 on a M LIfe offer. Explanation as to room mix up was none were left. I asked how when it was booked 3 months ago. The only answer I got was you still got a free room and a good deal on the other two nights.
50,I always stay at the Luxor because there is plenty of parking many of the same games so I dont have to wait. And the staff will always assist anytime I had questions. The rooms are always clean and the room service ladies are nice and always help with extra towels.
10,Dont recommend staying at the luxor right now due to they are having remodeling done there is problems with the rooms you dont have water from 12pm to 3pm daily and some rooms dont have a/c and they have fans only
10,When we got into our room I had no water. I ran outside and one of the cleaning ladies informed me that the water was out and she didn't know why so I had to take my family out to use the restroom. Then on my last night the water stopped working in the middle of my shower. Had to wait over an hour for it to come back on and then only had cold water. Just overall horrible experience.
30,Great hotel rooms but lack of Verizon cell service and Wi-Fi coverage in the West Tower. The room was very nice as well as the salon and spa. And there are multiple swimming pools all of which are excellent. Some parts of the hotel are somewhat dated and can use renovation. We had one bar of cell service on a good day and Wi-Fi was spotty going in and out during our stay.
30,We came from Riverside with a Corvette Club just to get out and let out some steam. Looking at the Luxor coming into town we had high expectations of the accommodations. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The room size was satisfactory for the price!! Now what we found unsatisfactory was there was no refrigerator or microwave in the room!! The hallway vending machine was empty our entire stay!!
10,I booked 4 rooms - i Made Two additional calls after booking 1) to make sure they knew we were going to be a late checking and 2) I made arrangements for guests arriving before me to get into their room. I spent no less the 45 minutes on hold - each call - my choice- I wanted everything to go smooth.  My guests arrived and had to wait 2 1/2 hours for me to get there. - they were not allowed into their rooms. When we finally got there (1:30 am) to help them check in I asked why they were denied access. The person checking me replied he had no idea. I booked 4 king rooms. I was told we were being upgraded. My 4 king rooms turned into 1 king and 3 queen. How is that an upgrade? I was told they did not have any King rooms available? What? They were available when I booked them and paid for the first night IN FULL as a requirement to keep my reservation. We were then told if we did not like the queen rooms we could come back later that day (remember it is now 2:30AM) and get different rooms. Really? I’m was there to get married and you want us to take rooms of lesser value for a few hours and then all 8 of us move to the type of rooms I booked and paid for? Just a bad experience all around.
30,Over all good experience but had issues with air and no water. Room clean and comfortable.Pool service at the cabana was horrible. The casino was clean and had lots of slots. Food was a little pricey and long wait for pyramid cafe.
10,Horrid. Do not recommend. Rooms not nice or clean. Halls falling apart. “Inclinators” falling apart. Lines and wait to speak with staff too long to get any resolution to any issues that arise. Just choose a nicer place. Even if you “won’t be in your room that much”.
20,When I arrived the first room I was given was not clean. I have pictures to support. The tub had used soap and hair still in it the floors were not vacuumed and dog food still on the floor the table tops and night stands were dirty and had not been cleaned or wiped down. When I was placed in a new room I had to move all my luggage alone. The new room's power went out and it took me complaining to management for them to fix it 4 hours later... After the power was restored they still began to flicker. I was so disappointed I didn't bother to contact management any longer I just dealt with it until my check out. The elevators wasn't  working and took so long to transport. There were no refrigerators in any of the rooms. For my first visit to Las Vegas turned into my worst vacation experience I've ever endured. Thank you for allowing me to waste money time and experience.
30,Second stay at The Luxor and will be staying somewhere else if we come back. Hotel is relatively nice just some run down parts that need attention. Restaurants are really pricey and parking prices are too high.
20,Rooms where hot no a/c setting everything was old the water stopped working timeshare was all up in our business soon as we entered the hotel it was too far from the strip there is also no 24 hour dining
10,Wurst experience for service bad ac clogged sink and shower. Mean room service. From day one to 3rd day. Never came to my room when I asked for extra pillows. No soap and one shampoo given in the bathroom. Ridiculous
50,The staff never hassled upon receiving requests and helped almost flawlessly every-time. A lack of coffee machines and fridges in the room caused inconveniences but still an overall great stay. If the rooms were connected as requested the trip would have been a 9.8 outve 10 but it was still a solid 8.9 outve 10 would definitely stay again.
30,The exterior of the hotel is immaculate. We stayed in the newly renovated pyramid king room and our window was leaking when it rained. The new renovations were done very poorly and the shower only had a half door so water sprays out all over the floor.
20,Room was dirty. The entire building was hot. The elevator key card reader to get to your hotel was broken and anyone could just get on and go to a room. Didn’t feel safe. Awoken by lots of cops in the night at the room across from mine. The whole floor smelled like marijuana. The hotel room was extremely far from parking and the entire layout was confusing. You have to walk miles just to get to your car. This was my first time here and I’d never come back. Very sketchy.
30,I’m typing this on my cellphone so I’ll keep it short:  Staying in a recently remodeled Pyramid room. Very nice but bathroom shower only has a partial door. Floor gets flooded every time. Dumbest design I’ve ever seen! In a few years the Luxor will have extensive water damage.  Several elevators not working. Since the elevators only go to pre-determined floors we have to use the same elevators every time. Long line today to get to the elevator.  There is some construction going on but we haven’t heard any noise.  Pool deck opens at 9:00 am. Only the north entrance is open. The actual pool doesn’t open until 9:30 am...or 10:00 am...or 10:30 am. I asked one of the lifeguards why it’s so inconsistent and she said they can’t allow anyone into the water until all the lifeguards show up. They can’t set regular hours? And you better get to the pool by 9:45 am or all the chairs will be gone. And don’t even think about moving one of the chairs! One of the lifeguards yelled at us because we angled the chairs a little bit to avoid the hot sun. Unbelievable!  Pool is okay but not super clean water.  Check-in was quick - only 10 minutes. I’ve never seen a long line at the check-in desk. Avoid using the MGM app to check-in. We talked to a few people who tried it and it doesn’t work.  Housekeeping has been great - no complaints.  BTW - there are 2 pools at the Luxor: the free pool and the pay pool. Not sure how much the pay pool costs but I suspect they don’t open the free pool in the morning until the pay pool is full?  Luxor buffet is closed but the Excalibur buffet is now open. Had breakfast there today - pretty good but terribly expensive for a buffet. Over $30.00 per person.  A/C unit in our room works okay but really noisy. I had to go to Walgreens and buy some earplugs so I could sleep. I suggest you bring some earplugs to Vegas - just in case.
10,Terrible due to bad customer service with a problem that my Air Conditioner was never fixed until to the last night of my stay. After several phone calls throughout the weekend and waiting in line at the desk lobby because the phone requests were never honored. After all that it was still frustrating because we had to change rooms which was hassle to move everything we had placed in one room to the other and that made us late to our dinner/club reservations for the night which basically ruined our Saturday night.
10,Rooms were filthy. Hair all over in the bed all over the floors in the bathtub and the shower. Our bedding had not been changed they just remade the bed. House keeping broke our door and just left it. The plumbing kept backing up there is more but it was a horrible stay.
20,First and Last TIME!!! First off the check-in process is INSANE...I have always paid for my room before I arrived and it has never been a problem booking through the same source M-LIFE. I booked through mlife and it tells you the total amount due upon check-in. Now they have where you can’t call to make the payment but they will send you the credit authorization form. Ok kool so I thought. I wasn't even tripping about the $15 fee it was the extra hold they want to put on their room post-pandemic to make up the money they weren’t getting during the pandemic. I've been coming to Vegas for over 6 years. I have never had a deposit held on my credit card. You want to hold $50 a night on top of paying $35 a night in the resort fee on top of the room rates $30 a day to park in a hotel under renovation when the whole world was on lockdown for a year. So you tell me if the invoice says you only owe $350 upon check-in and you send me a preauthorization for almost twice that then why would I pay that. Most deposits are a one-night stay or $100 a stay. 4 elevators went down one by one each of the 5 days I was there. The wait 15 mins - 25 mins either direction up or down.  The shower concept is pretty but does nothing but cause water damage and you can tell the water damage throughout the hotel by looking at the ceilings. The shower pressure is great but at the pressures it gives and the little to no shower curtain or enough glass to block the water I’m guessing the shower was designed for people who are Jr sizes and smaller not junior plus to women. You get the point. The housekeepers I met had attitudes. You applied for this job I didn’t. Your job is to prep the room right the first time and I wouldn't have to come and ask you for things that should already be in my room for my convenience. First off the towels were not in my room like they should have been upon check-in but this lady told me I need to call housekeeping to get whatever I wanted so you know I was hella confused when this same lady just knocked on the room next door and said Housekeeping. On top of that the water was off every day and I had to call and ask the first day. It wasn’t off long but still how unhealthy and unsanitary is that coming out of a pandemic that requires you to keep your hands clean. Sanitizer doesn’t work for everything you need to wash.  The best 3 things about the Luxor is #1 that Deli by the entrance to Fantasy by Elevator 2B. The STAFF and FOOD are AMAZING!!! (THE ONLY
10,Pre booked the Stay well suite for me and friends 6 months in advance… didn’t have one available at check in and never had one become available! Had no water for 3 days in a row from 12 to 4 pm… no notice either.
20,I was forced to upgrade when I was already promised adjoining rooms which was not the case when I checked in. Was a Bday trip so I was a little disappointed to be cut short $300 of my trip $. I had to leave a day early.
10,Luxor is no longer a good or safe place to stay. Got hit on by ladies of the night at least 1 time every 10 minutes. It’s crazy how bad it has gotten. Me and my Mgm platinum status will no longer be back. Staff is also afraid of the clientele! Thugs of every color have overrun the Luxor. They will not call them out because of fears or danger and being called a racist. It’s worse than you can imagine. If you have a family the worst mistake you could make is taking them to the Luxor. I have not stayed in another hotel in Las Vegas since 1995 but my money will never be back at the Luxor. If you enjoy not sleeping then the Luxor is your place. I was in a suite but surrounded by fools.
30,While I understand Covid has caused a decline service was less than par here!i don’t feel there is a valid excuse and for the price they totally do not provide the paid for service. They didn’t seem to care
30,I never expected the Luxor to go downhill the way it has.    Pros: the staff was friendly and quick to respond. Lots of restaurants and bar options ranging from pricey to affordable. Online check in and electronic keys available to avoid long lines. Baggage storage available if you have to check out but flights leave later.    Cons: specifically requested a renovated room as the hotel is undergoing upgrades. The room we were assigned looked circa 1980s. The bathroom door looked like a dog had been closed inside and tried digging out. Instead of replacing the door they painted over the damage. Front desk confirmed I was definitely assigned a renovated room when looking at the room number we were assigned to. We were given three bath towels no washcloths bath mat or hand towels so had to request more towels. When we returned after lunch there was a large white garbage bag full of 7 bath towels two washcloths and four hand towels left on the bathroom floor. We had to dig through the garbage bag to find what we needed.The shower stall has half a vertical glass wall so the water will splash on the bathroom floor be very careful! The room didn't have a microwave fridge or coffee maker. And apparently if you are willing to dish out another $35 per day you can have a refrigerator brought to your room. Every guest door had trash bags outside full of towels for guests for whatever time they arrived - day or night. Very unsightly and a safety hazard.    I have been a guest in both very nice hotels and at Motel 6 and the equivalent. I know what to expect from each. Sad to say I have stayed in better Motel 6 rooms. Ratings/ 3 stars has to be a fake review submitted by management trying to bring in guests or they are from those who didn't actually stay there but visited the casino and Exhibits. Will not be staying there ever again!!
50,We had an awesome time. We did this trip for our 19 year anniversary. The hotel was clean and had a deep soaking tub which was a absolute delight after a 5 hour plane ride. They even made us new keys when I lost my other ones somewhere in the hotel. It was easy to get to the other hotels to check out everything everyone had to offer.
10,MGM has decided to charge for parking at their properties. This includes for registered guests. Moreover it's not a daily charge it's basically a $15 charge everytime you leave the parking lot.    This policy must be punished by not staying at or visiting MGM properties until this is rescinded.
50,The staff was professional friendly and attentive. The rooms were clean and had the appropriate number of towels needed. The pools were clean and inviting. Self-parking was hard at night even during the week.
50,I loved the room got a great upgrade love the stay will be back. Happy to stay love that we can visit three different hotels without leaving the building. The tender restaurant was amazing and all the staff was very helpful
20,Im a medical marijuana patient with a fractured spine since 4 years old and i have CONSTANT pain that marijuana helps with. Being threatend to pay $600 for medicating made me feel like a criminal instead of a guest. Especially with having K-9s lookong for it through the motel.
20,Seems like MGM no longer cares about Luxor. Really has gone down hill. Hotel staff are rude and will not help you for anything. Casino M Life are also not helpful in using comps or rewards. Definitely not worth your money.
50,We normally travel to Vegas 4 to 5 times a year and we stay at different MGM resorts but normally like to stay at luxor for fast in and out from the strip very clean and comfortable rooms and great game areas.
30,Below Average room more characters needed to satisfy survey. Maybe take another 1/2 a point off for that. It still wants more characters. It still wants more characters it still wants more characters.
50,Great hotel price and service. Since the moment we arrived the staff was always in point and ready to assist with and of our family needs. Pool was the best part for us didn't get a chance to try there food court but we sure will next time. Enjoy!
10,When I first arrived the bathroom sink was running & it was broken so we were unable to shut it off. I couldn't get through to the front desk quickly. I was put on hold for 10 minutes before I gave up & used the emergency line to get through to someone. Not a great way to start the experience at the hotel when you just want to relax after a long drive and have to immediately encounter an issue.    My best friend stayed in a separate room & was given a different room than the one she booked and had been looking forward to. She also gave up trying to call because she was put on hold for a long time and went to the front desk to resolve it. She was told if she was given the room she wanted she'd have to encounter a water shut-off between 12-3 the following day. That was the only way I found out I was going to experience a water shut-off in my room. Nobody at the front desk told me this when I checked in.    My best friend did an electronic check-in through the app and didn't get her virtual key until I (after waiting in a long line to do a manual check-in) got to the front desk. Using the app saves no time at all.    When I came back on my 2nd night excited to use to tub in the Pyramid Corner King Suite (hot tub style in the window overlooking the strip) the water was shut-off again. This was maybe around 9 PM. On top of the scheduled shut-off of 12-3 DAILY there was an emergency water shut-off as well. Basically the water wasn't working most of the trip is what it felt like. It was very frustrating.    Also the elevators in that part of the hotel (Elevators for section 3B of the hotel) were extremely shaky for some reason? It feels like they're about to break when you use them and it's scary. They sway back and forth the whole time.    Last but not least as I was doing a walk through upon checking-out to make sure we didn't leave anything behind in the hotel I reached for something under the bed (that was within view but I didn't know what it was) and ended up grabbing a previous guest's lube! It was open and had a hair on it and I unwillingly touched it which was disgusting. How did they not find that when cleaning the room before we got there? Why did they give us a room with a broken sink didn't the room cleaning crew notice that while getting the room ready for us? Why wouldn't they have contacted the mechanic before giving the room to us instead of making us have to deal with it?    Overall not a great experience.
30,Not sure if it’s just me but age is starting to show a lot at the Luxor. A lot of the rooms do not have convenient elevator access and the showers can get messy with water splashing everywhere if you move too much too fast. In the hall there were clear signs that some things were being worked on but there was a visible mess like dust and crumbled drywall on the carpets. The elevators are decently fast but they don’t feel safe at all. The best reason to stay here is the pricing for the rooms which isn’t bad compared to some of the other places on the strip. I don’t see myself there again though I’d rather just spend the few extra bucks to stay somewhere that will at least have a better shower experience. The staff friendliness really saves the Luxor too so kudos to their customer service.
20,I would not recommend the Luxor based on my room. The bathroom sink was very slow to drain. The refrigerator needed a good cleaning. The tub needs to be wiped down. The decor is outdated. I hope things will improve.
10,My last couple stays here we’re great and the reason i had chose to stay here this time but I doubt I will ever choose this hotel again horrible customer service and no respect from front desk or housekeeping
30,Hallways and room were filthy. Had air conditioning issues as well. Living Room Dining Room and Kitchen were all very cool and comfortable however the Bedroom/Bathroom areas were 78/79 degrees. ALL dealers were exceptional fun and friendly! They really made the stay worth staying and not relocating.
50,Room was nice employees were the best. Convenient to other casinos just wish the slots were a little looser. Restaurants were great and we enjoyed the food. Player club employees were friendly and helpful.
50,This hotel was amazing! Great location and great amenities. I definitely will be back! It’s connected to other surrounding hotels. I loved being able to travel to other hotels without even having to walk outside. This hotel was definitely a Vibe!!! Loved it
10,My wife and I were not at all happy with our stay! Paid for a “Newly Renovated” room and instead received an out dated room with trash still inside and switched to another that was dated and not up to expectations at all
30,Room was hot  they gave a fan but barely helped. Didn't want to waste more time as long as it took to get a fan. We just went out. Carpet stains and elevator not working. Only one out of four so long wait to go down.
20,Our stay started out okay. Front desk employee Claudia went above and beyond for us upgrading us into a pyramid suite. When we arrived to our room the water wasn’t running and the toilet didn’t flush. This was rectified fairly quickly. However the next day our lock battery died on our front door leaving us stranded out of our room for hours. We were told to wait on security to let us back in but they never came. We were upgraded into a different room for the inconvenience however on our check out day my husband called to request a late check out. We were told we couldn’t be accommodated because a “VIP was checking into our room.” Aren’t rooms assigned when the person checks in at the hotel?    My husband pressed the employee asking if we could just check out an hour past check out. She became upset saying “fine just check out at 12 then!” And hung up the phone before either of us could respond.    I’m not sure we will ever return but would like to thank Claudia for her exceptional service.
20,My 'newly renovated' hotel room in the Pyramid was absolutely horrible!!! The showers really need a full door to prevent water from getting EVERYWHERE. They want us to conserve water by reusing towels which is cool but we had to use all of them to soak up the floor each time we took a shower... it just makes no sense. Front desk is pretty much impossible to reach wait no they ARE impossible to speak with unless you want to spend your entire vacation on the phone or in line. Pool was nice taxi guy was awesome and there was good food but the overall experience with the hotel was the worst I have ever encountered.    Tips for potential customers use the app for your key but connect to wifi so it works because cell service is choppy and remember to charge up your phone because that front desk line is soooooooo long.. too long to wait for a key.
30,"Stayed at Luxor due to Titanic exhibit. Paid for a ""newly renovated"" room but it didn't appear to be that 'newly'. The toilet made a very horrid loud sound every time flushed. There isn't a complete shower door so water got all over. There was some sort of smell we couldn't place each time we entered the room. The bed was a little hard for my liking but was crisp and clean the pillows were excellent. The tv always went to a loud level every time turned on but worked well. For being right next to the airport we never heard a single plane. Staff was nice. Elevators are like Wonkavator tilt 39 degrees but no warning outside and if you're not standing to see the buttons you have no clue and think you're going to die. I would stay again in a pinch but wouldn't make this my go to place at this point."
20,dirty torn up elevators bucket catching leaks cracked toilet odd shower with 1 door poor tv and long check in line and pool area not exactly sparkling. this is not what we remember in years past and its not the pandemic to blame. the casino looked sharp but everything else eh !
10,Hotel and room not clean at all! Customer service was lacking tremendously! Absolutely horrible check in. Toilet was spraying water. Room was not cleaned from the night before. Truly disappointing! Will never stay here again
30,Like I said in the beginning we didnt get the room we wanted staff we encountered was rude other then I dont wanna group them all together Public House was AMAZING and we had one cocktail waitress that was awesome!! Room was dirty we have standed in ALOT of hotels and this was honestly the worst we have ever stayed in!
10,Hot water did not work. Air conditioning was very poor in both rooms. First time staying here and me and my father had 2 elite tower suites which were dirty and not maintained. The in room food service doesnt exist.
30,The hotel rooms in the pyramid need to be updated badly. The hotel itself is at the far end of the strip and you have to travel through several hotels to get to the monorail to take you down the strip. The casino itself is not very large but it is adequate.
50,New Rooms Awesome. Can't Wait To Come Back In March Of 2022. My Brothers and Their Familys Cousins and Friends... If There Had Been A Problem The Service Never Let You Know. They Took Care Of Everything...
30,The rooms looked like they hadn't been vacuumed I asked housekeeping to vacuum on day 2 it was half assed. Beds weren't made one day. They never took the dirty glasses from the casino. The trash was overflowing in the elevator hall.
20,Rooms floors was not clean the carpet had stains on it. The elevators shake drink machine will take your money. The restaurants on site wasn’t open ( Tender box) then the sign referenced you to their sister hotel steak house they were closed and their sign referenced guest to Tender a lot of back and fourth
10,Worst experience at a hotel. We paid for a suite and one of the AC units was not working the mini fridge was also not working and the staff was beyond rude when we asked for help. It took calling front desk about 7 times to send someone out to get it looked at.
10,Rooms were messy upon checking in. Rooms are severely outdated. Very little outlets in the room. We had several maintenance issues with our rooms including being locked out of our rooms and air conditioning not working properly. This hotel definitely needs a face lift. The elevators seemed a little sketchy like they haven’t been fixed or kept up with very well. Only good thing about it is it’s on the strip.
10,Buyer beware. Lots of renovations going on and my “King Suite” was anything but. Make sure you ask for a newly renovated room……if you stay there. Marijuana smell was overwhelming at every entrance amd in the hotel. No security to usher off those smoking in the entry.
50,Right on strip but just far enough to easily drive in and out of parking lot without traffic problems. Great distance from area 15 and other things. Service was great. Just know what towers to go when I li check in
30,"The property itself is great but none of the machines would accept my MGM players card. Kept telling me ""invalid card"" so I got nothing for my comps and freeplay. I had $100 in freeplay I earned for my trip and I couldn't use any of it because the machines wouldn't take my card. That's shady... cuz my card works just fine at the MGM Northfield Park... but of course I don't earn comps here. So I guess that was just the way of holding me down."
10,Water shut off due to remodel … room changed than the second room smelled like a sewer it was coming from the shower drain the smell was horrid. Not a friendly and knowledgeable stuff on the front desk. Very unprofessional and disappointing
10,Let just say they moved us in two different units both had issues. The irony in the fact that both units had plumbing issues led us to believe that there are most likely many more problems in the building considering most do not see but the surface issues. The Bell desk gentlemen who helped us move rooms was exceptional though. Tipped him and couldn't of asked for better assistance. As for the management we spoke with rude and had no idea how to help other than offering a food and beverage credit in which she never explained how to use or when we would recieve. I used to love the luxor but it unfortunately lost me as a customer. I really hope other MGM resorts don't become as bad as the luxor. Believe me when I say this is not to get something free or just to complain I work in the hospitality industry myself. We also had just stayed four days at the Vdara by Aria with no complaints. When we were flying out of vegas our flight was cancelled so I was like alright lets stay at one of my all time favorites The Luxor. The dust and construction going on made everything inside undesirable. If you are going to vegas and are expecting a high quality experience please stay somewhere else unless you like the experience of a motel 6 on the strip because this is what it felt like. Especially when considering the customer service of management.
30,Really enjoyed the stay. Room was nice and quiet bed was comfy. Only issue is the air conditioning unit doesn’t give enough air quality to the whole room. Very hot being a summer month. If that was fixed then they would definitely get a perfect score
10,Very hot room. Hotel room was hot and ax wasn’t blowing cold air. Also there was no fridge and shower was leaking. Other then that not bad. Also didn’t find the safe till the last night there. Would of liked something telling me where safe was
30,My recent stay at Luxor for my first trip to Vegas was slightly less exciting than I had expected. The location was in a good spot close to the airport and not far from down the strip however I just felt like the hotel was not clean. The smoke smell permeated everything the rooms were average at best and the other amenities were nothing to write home about. We didn't have water for 3.5 hours there are not enough front office staff members to accomodate check in let alone all the guests calling down for assistance housekeeping turned off the AC and came back to a room entirely too warm spotty wifi. Again nothing horrible and I truly hate sounding complainy but for people looking for an honest review I have to say I was less than impressed top to bottom with my stay.
10,We had a horrible experience at the Luxor. We booked our room MONTHS in advanced called a week prior to our reservation date to verify our room was secured and upon arrival we were told our room wasn’t available. They gave us a temporary room for the night until our room would be ready and when we got to that room it was DIRTY! The beds had been slept in there was trash all over it obviously hadn’t been cleaned from the last guests. Not mention when we arrived it was around 2am because we drove a very long way. So we didn’t get into a CLEAN room until almost 4am. Almost all trash cans in the hotel were overflowing with trash that hasn’t been taken out there was trash in the elevators it was very unsanitary. What’s most unfortunate is that this wasn’t even our first experience with this type of situation at this hotel. We most definitely will not be returning to the Luxor.
30,I know I like a little more small Hotel. This Hotel definitely was not my cup of tea. I think it need a make over.  When i purchased my reservation I was able to have parking included.  If i did ask the front desk how will the parking being validated. that would have been horrible.
30,First of all the parking should be free for resort guests who are staying there and second the ground floor that i was staying on should have been properly sprayed for cockroaches and 3rd the cleanliness of the hallways to my room was very dirty.. I really believe we should have been upgraded to a better room that wasn't on the ground floor...
10,I stayed at the Luxor from 6/21-6/23/2021 post covid & for the amount paid I expected more. I should of stayed at Motel 6 & saved money. Resort & Parking fees. I was Never was able to use the pool area because of the capacity limit & then placed on a waiting list that I NEVER moved up on. The dresser draws continued to open on it's on & bruised me on multiple occasions the hallways were FULL of trash trash left at room doors & bags of dirty laundry left by housekeeping. A $25 daily fee if I wanted a refrigerator in the room. Only 2 pillows were provided for a king size bed and they were too soft. I do understand it is hard to keep the exterior side of windows cleaned but that's NO EXCUSE for the inside windows to have grease marks of finger prints hand prints & forehead prints. The ac did NOT adequately cool the room. The ac could ONLY be felt if standing next to it. Last the traction tracks of the curtains were broken which caused the curtains not to move & unable to close or push them back further. The corridors were extremely messy NOT what I would expect from a MGM property nor a property on the Las Vegas Strip or a property charging the price of their rooms
10,Make sure you pull your door shut because people walk around pushing doors and stealing stuff out of the rooms. Security is aware (they told us it happens all the time) and we saw lots of doors just on our floor that weren't shut. Ours only shut properly after maintenance came and adjusted it but that was only after we got robbed. Had to file report with the police and no one from the hotel ever bothered to call and make sure we were OK.
10,We walked in the room to no pillows no shower door or curtain fell on the bathroom floor and hurt my whole right side! 3hrs of no toilet or sink! Front desk was contacted and phone just rings! Called housekeeping multiple times! Usually I enjoy the Luxor this time
10,Sex in pool. When your kid needs to brush away cigarette butts to swim. STAY AWAY! !!!! Absolutely horrible. I paid to stay at the Wynn after the first night. Granted I had already paid for the Luxor. THAT BAD! As a frequent LV visitor and gambler. MGM has lost its brand with me and my extended family.
40,I was one of those who received a comp room invitation from last year and this was the 2nd time using the invitation for my stay at Luxor. Unfortunately when I got a final bill it didn’t reflect a comp offer that I thought had been used when I booked online. If you have any issues you must deal with the mlife folks which are separate from the Luxor hotel staff in this case they are located next to the cashiers cage in the Luxor casino. The reason they gave was that the comp offer does not apply on weekends but that wasn’t the case when I used it for a weekend booking last year for turkey weekend at Excalibur. Anyways I not really bent out of shape because the charges were only a little more then a weekday rate which was odd.    Definitely if you have a smartphone download the mgm app to use for room checkin. First this allowed me to bypass the long wait for folks waiting to checkin and talk with a desk agent. In my case I got. Notifications my room was ready and to goto a separate area which was only a couple of people ahead of me to create room keys.    Now the room we got was in the tower the view was the back parking lot no big deal. The one feature here was a separate shower and bathtub. WiFi was solid inside the room at all hours    Unfortunately I got in after they started charging for parking and I don’t have pearl status did try to reach it but fell short.    I found the food court the same cookie cutter as other mgm properties interesting that they give you a buy one item get 2nd half off as a tray paper cover which I suspect most people don’t look at.
20,Our stay would have been okay if they would have disclosed before booking our stay that they are renovating the hotel. We came back to our room after visiting the pool on the second day of our stay to find two letters from the hotel manager. One stated that every day for the rest of our stay the water in our room would be shut off while they worked on the lines from 12pm to 2pm. However our water in our room didn’t come back on until around 3pm and that was after my husband complained to the front desk. We also came back to our room on the third night to find the water off again at 8 pm. My husband again had to complain to the front desk to get it turned back on. The other letter stated that they would be working on the lights on the outside of the pyramid from 7pm and 11 pm every night for the remainder of our stay and if we wanted privacy during those hours to make sure we closed our curtains. After visiting other hotels on the strip during our stay I don’t think we stay at the Luxor again on any future trip to Vegas.
10,We booked a cabana off the recommendation of Luxor employee and turned out pool was closed that day. There was a mess by elevator the entire time we were there. I guess no one cleans common area. Found a slot machine that was paying and they put out of order sign after I hit.
20,I stayed at the Luxor the week before Mother's Day. Our check in took more than 30 minutes. Our first room the air didn't work which is unacceptable on 112 degree days. The second room the sink stayed clogged and drained slowly. In addition our trash sat outside our room door for more than two days. Just trifling and unacceptable for the room rates that they charge.
10,"Stayed here during the recent heatwave and the AC barely worked. The place is dark and drab smells like old nasty water. They should let you know before booking that they're ""under construction"" The room had an old school knob on the AC .. not a wall thermostat that I swear turned off at night. NO MICROWAVE maybe because it was so hot I could leave my food on the table with the blinds open. Not enough washclothes and towels and GOD FORBID you ask them to send you some.. they cime bang on your door and are rue to top it off.. the $220 and dinner at Tender was ""nice"" it was cooked perfectly but so salty I needed my blood pressure medicine... my husband went to get his phone and the ""nice"" waiter says ""Oh he left you?"" what kinda sh** is that? this was our third time in Vegas but the Luxor was our first and LAST time."
20,Mind boggling how a manager is willing to double charge my card and then not willing to correct their mistake they caused entirely. Also extremely shocking that they don’t even have the decency to return calls or correct their errors when I went in to discuss in person after not answering calls
30,the hotel staff was very friedly and excellent the rooms are clean but a lot older need updating. The Casino is a little small compared to others on the strip but they do have a lot of the latest slots and games hard to find a lot open during the week Monday thru Friday
20,Love this hotel and the staff and they are all wonderful and still wonderful  But .........  What happened for my three day stay construction material was in the hallway does no management walk the halls and check this stuff  Renovated Pyramid Room was old furniture from the Bellagio. Renovate room and dont change face plates how much is this like $0.50. The pillows were Misérables one guest described them as 'Postage Stamps'  Sad good bye to someplace I loved to come to over the past 25 years
10,Didn’t stay there….after all of the horrible reviews and lack of service from my travel partner I decided to stay elsewhere…. I passed by and the smell of sewage made me sick….honestly I think MGM should be ashamed…nothing being done about it? I payed extra and stayed at the M resort which is pristine! So  thanks to everyone who contributed to past experiences as to not ruin my trip
10,"1) Cleanliness of room. The floor was filthy. How filthy? I found the temple from a pair of glasses under the rack that holds suitcases...and it was not mine.  2) The AC did not work. My room never got below 77 degrees. It was supposedly ""fixed"" one day but it was not.  3) Restaurant selection and food quality was terrible. I wouldn't recommend anyone to eat in your food court of diablo's.  4) No refridgerator so I could at least keep a drink cold.  5) Not enough light.  6) I didn't get a wash cloth on one of my 3 days.  7) The smoke detector was beeping when I arrived because the battery was low. Took 3 hours for someone to fix it.  8) Check in took forever. Not enough staff."
40,On our way to San Diego we stayed at the Luxor. We're timeshare people so drive thru pit stops are extremely rare especially in Vegas. I can understand how people complain about checking in and how long it takes and yes it was long but this is a huge casino/resort what do you expect. So no real complaints here. Our room was actually pretty nice. We reserved the updated Pyramid King room and it was nice. Everything was updated but yes the air conditioning could have been better worked ok but I did see workers working on the condensers outside abd there massive. The elevators yes they were tough and bumpy but the ones we used all worked was a little skiddish on using them but they were fine. The only problem I had was the no fridge. In my included picture with the entertainment center a hole is made just for a mini fridge. I get why but it's really hard to stock full meals on those little fridges. But thats just one option to keep various fluidic beverages from your possession. But pay for parking is back which means Vegas is back and not going anywhere.
20,Pro: water pressure in the shower was good and water cold.    Con: checking ticket almost 40 minutes with the long line. Room did not have towels. Take over 3 hours to have towels delivered. Used toothpicks on stands next to bed. Plastic and garbage still on floor. Hair use soap still in the bathroom. Toilet did not flush. Shower did not drain while and took over 20 minutes to do so. Check out was a mess! No support or help with issues.    The rooms were excessively hot Limited in room air conditioning units that were very poor.    Beds was okay but nothing special for certain. Pillows lumpy.    Paid for parking at the check-in and it did not register so we had to pay again and then spend time waiting at the front desk to get credit for the $15 per day.    Please save your money and stay somewhere else.
30,Check in wasn’t too bad. It was pretty quick. We were being told that the room we originally paid for was all sold out so we were going to be “upgraded”. The room was clean; it had hair left over on the nightstand from the previous stay sink was clogging and a bar of used soap from the last person who stayed. I’ve stayed at Luxor in the past and it wasn’t like this. It was unfortunate that it happened this time as we were celebrating. Hopefully Luxor will make it right.
10,Checked in with 2 rms. 1 shower flooded Bathrm. 2nd never cooled down. 4 hours later still no one showing up. They said they could move us meaning we move everything. New rm shower either very hot or cold no way to change. Shower valve installed wrong. Room smelled like someone just smoked a pound of weed. This morning been on hold for over 40 minutes. Tired of hearing carrot top while on hold. WILL NOT STAY HERE AGAIN. And rooms and bathrooms are nasty.
50,The first night of our stay was awesome! Great rooms fun times. Then on our second morning our electric door lock broke. It took over three hours for the hotel to let us in. Finally it took Ty an awesome guard to save the day. The issue was a dead battery on our hotel door. I tracked up and down and up and down and up and down. Finally Ty the security guard arrived. He saved day! He made sure engendering arrived within 5 minutes! The problem was fixed In two minutes. The hotel was great but without the great customer service from Ty this five star review would have gotten a one.
10,There are no amenities no room service no buffet everything is extremely far to walk and the room wasn’t clean as it should have been. There was noise early in the morning due to workers fixing the building.    This place isn’t safe for children. I saw and confronted a man taking pics of a woman and her little girl. She didn’t know him and we confronted him. He was a trafficker and he was with a woman taking pics of little girls.
10,"This had been our ""go to"" hotel when in Vegas. We loved the adult only pool the casino was clean well staffed and had a great assortment of slots table games and even a poker room. The restaurants were nice and the food was above average quality. Though we never like the rooms in the pyramid we did enjoy the tower rooms and always found them to be clean and comfortable. NONE of that is the case anymore.  The only dining options open were the cafe for breakfast and lunch (1hour 45 min wait for breakfast - NO room service) some of the food court for lunch or dinner or Public House for dinner.  There was only one small bar open for most of the day the larger center casino bar didn't open until the evening and some were closed down altogether. They have taken away the poker room - not just closed temporarily but gone forever. The staff that were around - and they were hard to find- acted as though they would rather be getting root canals than be there working.  The pools were dirty  cloudy looking with scum on all the tile edges. The adult pool was filled with screaming children and all their pool toys including footballs zooming through the air. There were waitstaff available but they looked overworked and unhappy.  We stayed in the tower rooms and both (we had them change us from the first room we were given) were filthy though the second room was minus the bobby pins malted milk balls and pieces of broken plastic that littered the floor. There are other gross details (I took pictures) but suffice to say you would not want to stay here. To top it off the beds were wholly uncomfortable.  We did talk to two different employees who both told us that staff was hard to get to come back to work and that management did not have their backs and they were involved in labor disputes."
10,If you like no amenities and dried vomit on your bed this place is for you. No pad and paper no minibar or fridge no hangars no robe no scale no brochure with a site map no nothing.    If you want a room with no internet or WiFi signal and also an app electronic key that won’t because of that this place is for you.    If you want to pay four times the cost of a motel 6 for a crappier room this place is for you.    If you want to pay for an upgraded room and think you’ll be taking your family to a pyramid and end up in a tower next to it with a view of a parking lot this place is for you.    If you want dirty furniture sticky carpet and a bed that has no linens and looks like an army cot this place is for you.
10,I arrived around 12:30 at midnight and had to wait till 2 a.m. to check in due to the amount of people in line. Not only was the wait terrible but the fast check in wasn’t pulling up my confirmation code so i had no choice but to wait in line. The view was nice but being woken up 3 times by room service walking into our room was the last straw. I’ll probably never come back to the Luxor due to how poor it was ran.
50,Previous reviews were questionable but I decided to stay anyway. So glad I did! Our room was beautiful clean and comfortable. We couldn’t ask for any more. Quietest hotel I’ve been in forever. Thank You Luxor for a great stay!
30,Lobby is impressive but rooms need updating. Room was huge especially for the price but needs updating and garden tub wouldn't drain.Kind of far south on the strip so lots of walking and/or taxis. Love the app check in/check out system but had trouble with the digital key. No receipt on final checkout.
30,Overall experience was good. Rooms are updated and clean. However the distance to get to your room is quite far and the route to get to your room is very confusing and like going into a dungeon. Gambling was hot and the dealers very personable.
10,Nice location but the place smelled like marijuana the sheets were yellow cups smelled like mildew just not the best experience at all. I wouldn’t book here again or recommend anyone to stay here at all
40,We were told we would have an available clean room no later than 11. We didn’t receive an email like we were told we would so we checked again at 2 and our room was ready. Not sure how long it had been ready but we were never notified like we were told we would be.
50,We had a great time at the Luxor. They seem to be really cleaning it up and trying to make it nicer. The gambling was very great with a variety of machines and tables. The rooms are nice but not top of the line.
40,Room needs to be remodeled  Broken tile in bathroom  Room looking old needs some care lots and lots of care  Just need to update the rooms would think about staying again if rooms were remodeled overall great casino
50,You really get what you pay at Luxor do not be complaining.  It is a budget hotel in a really nice location. I could use some coffee shop that is not Starbucks or a coffee maker in the room.  Other than that 5 stars to the friendly housekeeping
10,I would only rebook this place after the renovations. Overall location was perfectthe room service was great the men/women that linger in the casino and direct you if you were lost was great. But the room…hot af I get that it’s Nevada but if I’m paying this much for a roomI want to be able to turn it cold like Antarctica in my room. We didn’t get accommodations until the 3rd night but before they gave us a box fan that barley blew out any air..yes a box fan. I think this hotel needs to block off that section of the hotel until it’s fixed cause once we moved it was better.
10,I’m usually not one to complain but the service was terrible and everyone was rude there’s was no room service and we could never get ahold of anyone from our phone in the room the AC didn’t work but we just dealt with the heat … the room was smelly snd dusty and the waitresses in casino floor were all rude ! Won’t be staying there ever again !
20,It took almost 45 minutes to check into the hotel. Our bathroom had not been cleaned and we had no towels and the toilet was filthy! It took 45 minutes to get out of the parking lot each time! Terrible experience!
50,I’ve always had a good time here. This hotel in my opinion is a little more family friendly than other hotels on the strip I’ve stayed at. For the price it’s worth staying here. The team members here were really helpful. Especially at the MLife Counter
50,Don't know where to start. Hands down the best resort. No need to look any further. This resort is spotless. Friendly staff. Food is amazing. Housekeeping is awesome. Check in is effortless. Simply love the LUXOR
20,Don’t expect luxurious accommodations or resolution to your concerns from front desk. Rooms are outdated and staff unwilling to address concern. Definitely use mobile check in. Location at southern end of strip means a lot of walking and/or taxi trips.
50,I wanted the pyramid experience. I enjoyed my stay. The first room was too far from everything. I was given a room came worth no issues and the rooms were great. The dining experience at the Pyramid cafe was exceptional
50,The themeing has been scaled back in recent years but it still has that Egyptian feel to it. Hot tubs still closed for social distancing but the Oasis pool was just as enjoyable. Staff extremely friendly. Our room was upgraded at check in the $20 trick still works. The hotel has everything going for it except it's location. What you save on hotel costs you will probably spend on transportation (unless you enjoy walking in the 100 degree heat)
50,It is located right off the strip but there is not a monorail from the hotel (in case that is what you plan on taking to get around). The casino is a decent size unlike some other hotels. There are shows and food inside the hotel. There is a mall and two hotels connected. It is VERY easy to get around.
50,My experience at the Luxor was okay. Not our first time in Vegas but first time at Luxor. We didn’t have any issues except for all the animals. Other than that we had an awesome time. Staff members were also okay.
40,Overtime the frequency of guest visiting the Luxor depreciates the quality of it. However the Luxor works hard with keeping it up. It’s an older hotel with upgrades to its rooms; inasmuch a little more is needed
20,We couldn't open the windows to enjoy the view as the windows radiated heat and the AC couldn't keep up. The bottom of the windows have a gap in them and would wake us up as soon as the sun came up (Gap at the bottom of the window/)
20,Won’t be returning. For this to be my first time in Vegas this experience almost makes me not want to return all together. Check in…slow. Check out…slow. Hotel is incredibly understaffed and on top of it all I ran into an incredibly over-served guest who called me racist because I didn’t want to speak to her as I was waiting for my Uber to the airport. Rude maybe yes racist absolutely not. My husband and I are both African American 😑
10,MOLD no staff and what staff they did have was unprofessional/RUDE only one set of working elevators and no signs on the ones that weren’t running. Called staff after being on hold for more than 30 mins they did not seem to care. They said they only run it on certain days. How are we supposed to know they is no sign or info saying that information.
10,Stayed at the Luxor while in Vegas celebrating friends' birthdays. We had 5 rooms and everyone had to switch rooms ion check in because there was an issue with their original room. My 1st room on the tower side was dark not cleaned properly and the phone was FILTHY. I had to put the phone on speaker to call the front desk for a room change. The 2nd room was on the pyramid side. It was a much better bed than the tower room but the AC struggled to keep up and keep the room cool. Also there was some serious damage to the bottom of the bathroom door. I will say the food was pretty good at the Cafe and the pool area. Certain I'll never stay here again.
50,We have stayed at the Luxor at least a dozen times and will not stay anywhere else in Vegas. The rooms are comfortable the service is impeccable and the food options are GREAT! You must check out the Backstage Deli and El Diablos when you are there.
50,This place was great I just wish I could have won😁 it was clean cool from heat and had a lot to offer. I enjoyed it. The pool having longer open hours would be great since the hotel doesn’t have parties but overall a great experience.
40,Bad check in because of a rude employee but had a great time overall. Unfortunate we were able to get the better room we wanted due to the guy at check in not listening to my request. Hopefully next time we get get the upgraded room we were wanting.
40,Hotel was very nice only problem was our room smelled very bad with cigarette smoke. The staff did promptly switch our room. Staff is very friendly and moves quick with problems. I like the mobile check-in makes it easy and convenient
40,Terrific casino. We stayed in a pyramid room . Elevators are really shaky. The room is big - huge by Las Vegas standards. Newly renovated and nice. A/C wasn't great. Shower has great pressure but due to design the floor floods using it Good staff.
20,If you stay here. Book the tower. The pyramid was very loudly under contruction. New room shower floods the bathroom due to poor design. TV also not HD.    Smooth sailing once they moved me to the tower.
30,I don’t know if it was my floor but I was able to hear everything ❗️ People walking and housekeeping We’re really loud with they’re alarms ! And to top it off someone was able to get in my room with the same key !
40,The price of staying at the Luxor for one night was very affordable at the strip. To avoid waiting in a long line to check-in at the front desk go to mobile check-in and you can print your key cards yourself. If you need assistance to help you to use the mobile check-in someone will help you out immediately. It took me less than 5 minutes to use the mobile check-in device. My room was decent to stay for one night. All MGM properties including the Luxor will charge you parking after 1 hour free parking. I would get a Mlife Rewards Mastercard so you won't pay parking at all!
20,For a newly renovated room everything was either not functioning or poorly designed. The half shower doors virtually guarantee that you will get water all over the floor I almost slipped twice. None of the USB ports on the wall worked making it even more difficult to charge our electronics and even though there was a fridge in the room as advertised it costs an extra $25/day to run which was not advertised… Honestly for the money you’re better off staying somewhere more central on the Strip.
30,Some good some bad. Noisy construction nearby and hammering directly above. Transfer was swiftly granted but I wish I could have kept the pyramid room. New (tower) room was nicer. Food at Diablo was mediocre for me. Morgan at the pool entry/exit was EXCEPTIONALLY friendly! Hi Morgan!
20,Construction started at 6:45 am in room next to us. Drilling and hammering.  3 sets of elevators not working. Staff sent several couples to wrong elevators no one knew they were not working. Just pointing not showing where they were.
10,Not throughly cleaned. For the price I paid an all the hotel fees I expected a better view w/ the type of room I selected as well. Wasn’t to thrilled with the hotel. Won’t be a first second or third pick to stay at in Vegas for me.
10,Our room was broken into since our hotel room door was not properly latching and could be pushed open. There is no safety dead bolt to use. Our items were stolen the front desk helped us and had us file a security report but if we wanted our stolen items replaced then the report could not be filed as it was considered resolved. Just disappointed that they did not seem bothered by the fact that someone was breaking into rooms thankfully we were not in our room at the time.
10,We now live in a digital world.. and MGM wants you to check in using an APP.... just great... except the APP gives you NO OPTIONS. And they can text you for all kinds of STUPID REASONS such as reservation confirmation and your 'room is now ready' but what the Luxor cant seem to do is let you know you will not have WATER... they leave you a paper notice on the desk AFTER you check in and AFTER you move in to your room... Oh ya lets not forget the fact only a portion of the Elevators are working and MOST of the restaurants are CLOSED... oh wait it gets better... in the midst of the covid pandemic (Liberal term).... Luxor chooses to only open ONE of their many bars...a select few restaurants... and even fewer tables... so everyone is CROWDED together like pack rats.... I have been to Luxor NUMEROUS times... and this stay was by far the WORST EVER...
20,dirty roomoverall disliked it ALOTthey should work on the cleaniness!the room had blood like huh?also ac was badit said “70” while it felt like an ovenalso didnt have necessites(like said mini fridge)
50,If you are looking for a great stay in Vegas at a great price this hotel is what you need. The staff are respectful honest and upbringing. It made my vacation 10 times better at staying here. Would recommend to anyone wanting to have a great time in Vegas. 10 out of 10 review and will definitely be coming back!! :):)
50,Very crowded there was a massive line for the check-in desk and always a wait for the elevator and it was a weekday. The room is exceptional for being free. Use mobile check-in because it saves a headache.
20,Dirty rooms and poor customer service make this a mediocre spot to stay. We had issues with trying to get 2 extra pillows that took 2 days to resolve and over 40 minutes on hold. No one ever called me back regarding my complaint even though I received emails that someone would call me that day. But as I am NOT a high roller they really don’t seem to care.
30,Our room was very hot and we called for service was told it would be handled but they left a fan that didn't help much mind you we called again and was told someone came already so we had to deal with sleepless nights from Friday to Monday
20,Poor ac and water everywhere in the bathroom from no 2nd shower door on shower. We had water everywhere. Also ac didn't blow for all the room. Only one spot in the room. Very poor air circulation. Wouldn't stay again
30,Renovated room was nice. The shower was the best part. The trouble finding a working elevator to get to 7th floor was a real pain. Maybe after renovations are complete it will be better. Overall it was dark and gloomy. I walked to Excalibur or Mandalay Bay to eat.
10,So I booked a room in the permit suite and the sinks were clogged I didn’t want to wait for service to be set up there it’s not fair to you wasting my Vacation waiting for the luxe or to repair the sinks and there was an awful smell coming out I was relocated to a smaller suite the beds are so uncomfortable I can feel the springs and housekeeping didn’t do a great job cleaning the floors I don’t think ever get mopped not a good experience it’s better to pay a little more and make your vacation worth it and if you aren’t a smoker the ventilation successor you can still Sigur all night in your room I just never leaves I wouldn’t recommend it
10,It is very apparent there has been little to no upkeep on the property and the casino game selection and cleanliness is lacking. Some remodeling was In process but supposedly our room was recently remodel but it definitely was not! I will not be staying there again.
40,I stayed at Luxor this past week. I enjoyed my stay. I traveled alone and I felt safe. The staff was helpful when I got turned around to point me in the right direction. My room was nice. The only thing was sometimes there was a crowd at the elevator to get to my room but it wasn't that bad.
30,Probably one of the best priced casinos to stay in on the strip. Beds are super comfy rooms are clean and quiet and the Luxor has plenty of places to eat if you want to spend the money. The check in process took longer than it should've at the front desk due to barely any staff but you can do a mobile check in yourself if you want to. The only bad thing about the rooms is the lack of microwave fridge and coffee pot.
10,Upon arrival we waited in line an hour and a half to check in. Get to our room with 2 queens only to find 1 towel! No hand towel wash cloths soap or shampoo. TV didn't work due to wiring in the back. Waited on hold 40 minutes when called to front desk to ask for towels and tv repair. 45 minute minimum wait in line each day at Starbucks because they had 3 people working and all ovens were broken. Low budget experience! Felt sorry for the staff having to work in these circumstances!!
20,"You spend most of your time waiting in line. For elevators to check in or out to ask a question. Food options are terrible basically only fast food or steak house. The hotel is only useful if you love playing slots. Even the ""newly renovated"" rooms are in a bad shape."
40,I've been coming to the Luxor for a while. It's not the newest but I like the overall ambiance. I also like that it's far enough off of the main strip that it isn't crazy but close enough to get anywhere I need quickly. I'm always disappointed with the Resort fees. Not worth it for what it is supposed to cover it's just an obvious grab for money.
40,I had to attend a funeral of a dear friend. The services were near the hotel. A friend of mine recommended the Luxor because he had been there a number of times. This time because of circumstances I could only stay for one night. My next trip will be planned to spend more time to enjoy the area and casino much more that I could on this quick trip.
20,"We ran into many problems dure this trip. Starting with our ""fully renovated"" room having a old noisy ac unit and the tub drained so poorly that I had wayer up to my ankles during my shower. The second there was no water at all and multiple elevators for our build were broken which caused a flood of frustrated guest trying to other ways to get to there room (there wasnt any).    Download the app and check in online to save yourslef the possible hour long wait to checkin.    The pool is nice and all the staff I encountered were friendly amd as helpful as they could be.    I stayed here years ago with no issue but I wont be back."
10,Called ahead to inform them we would have a late check in. Arrived about 12:30 am. No valet no parking available. At check in they failed to validate my room key to other parking garages. 2 hours were spent looking for a place to park then they validated my room key. They change the room accommodations to a king room and we had 4 in our party. They were unable to change it back to my original booking. Then had to wait for a cot which came with no blankets. The couch was covered in hair so the bedding from the bed had to be used to cover the couch which left my children and I no blankets. The elevator had some type of cardboard material covering the entire inside which was duct taped together. Wires were hanging out of the ceiling. We were finally settled in at 4:30 am to just be right back up to get to the airport for our flight home. We will never stay at the Luxor again or recommend it to anyone.
20,There are renovations going on and it’s a huge mess. Half the elevators don’t work you have to wait in long lines to get in the elevator which is ridiculous. Having to pay for parking when you’re already paying a huge resort fee also is a little ridiculous. The staff wasn’t very helpful or friendly. The rooms aren’t in the best shape and areas around the rooms just look dirty. They seem to put their focus in other areas. There are much nicer places to stay in Vegas for a similar price.
10,The stay from start to finish was horrible. There was only one working elevator of which was a 10-15 min wait whenever. ONLY ONE open restaurant during the day. Construction going on through out the day and even a huge water leak that blocked a main walkway. The only good thing I have to say about my say was the shower had great pressure and drained.
50,We had an amazing check in experience with an extremely affordable upgrade to a suite and loved the room! The view was a bonus! The pool is also amazing! My friends and I will definitely be back as soon as possible!
20,Dirty rooms. Switched rooms and then A/C issues. Housekeeping takes forever. They give food and beverage credits for inconvenience but then your final bill still isn’t adjusted accordingly. Parking is ridiculous.
20,The Luxor Hotel And casino is located between Mandalay Bay and New York New York. Let’s start off with the things you need to know. Upon checking in to the hotel it is recommended that you use the online mobile check in from the MGM app to avoid waiting in long lines at the hotel check in. Having said that I would only use the express check in app only if you plan on using one credit card for your stay  be aware however the hotel is going to charge your card the amount of your stay plus 200 dollars for incidentals so if you don’t want such a big charge on one card you will probably need to go through the traditional hotel check in route because the online app will not allow for you to use multiple cards to split the charges up. Also be aware that not all rooms come with a in room refrigerator if this is the case with your room you can request that a refrigerator be delivered to your room but be aware the hotel is going to charge you a amenitie fee for the fridge.    Now for the not so great aspects of this hotel. Regardless of what you have read online about buffets in Vegas being open again this is totally not 100 percent true or at least at the time this review was written as of 6/10/21 the buffet at the Luxor hotel was still closed and no word on a date that Mgm will reopen this buffet.    And while I’m on the topic of dining options at the Luxor hotel. There is very little choices for dining options at the Luxor . The Mexican restaurant in the Luxor was never open during my stay and a very small food court that has strange hours.    Hotel is currently under some type of construction where between the hours of 9 am to 2 pm the water pressure and hot water is very limited.    Elevators to the rooms are very worn out and not very safe. At some points there was long lines to get on the elevator and you nearly waited 20 mins to get on the elevator some of it was due to multiple elevators being out of service.    I only received maid service in my room once during my stay. I tried calling the front desk for fresh towels and I could never get anyone on the phone at the front desk .    Biggest issue was the hallways to the hotel rooms smelled strongly of pot.    Don’t let the pictures of the pool area online fool you. I was not very impressed with the hotel pool. Pool area was small and half of the other pools were closed off due to life guard staffing issues . The pool that was open was very crowded.    The hotel in general seems to have a staffing problem which in time I’m sure it will get back to some normalcy.    Over all I was not very impressed with this hotel as the hotel seems very outdated and tired looking. Hotel could use some serious renovations to the lobby’s and the rooms.    This hotel might be ok for a one or two night stay but I don’t think it’s worth a weeks stay.    But definitely not worth the resort fees they charge I will definitely not be returning to this hotel.
10,I booked a trip 2 months in advance for my birthday but when I got to the Luxor to check in Brianca the operations manager down graded my room because she said it wasn’t available and gave me know reason why but the accommodations she did give me didn’t even work. Room had no cell service or WiFi
10,Elevators and halls smell strongly of weed. Bathrooms have very dirty floors. Feet get black after getting out of shower. Towels get black if dropped on floors. Tubs and showers need cleaned. They are sprayed with cleaner and residue left on not wiped or rinsed. No mini fridge or even coffee pots in rooms. Dirty windows. Could barely see out. Most restaurants closed. Couldn’t get answer at front desk for 3 days. Had to pay for parking which is ridiculous in Vegas. Also food court prices outrageous. Luxor is making its customers pay fir their loss from COVID when they should be happy to have them back and treat them with respect instead of price gouging.
10,If your on a budget… see if you can squeeze some additional funds to stay somewhere else. No hot water shortages 1 elevator works long lines no coffee machine fridge or microwave. Spend a little more to stay comfortably on your vacation.
50,The hotel is very nice and the employees go out of their way to make sure that you are comfortable. We are elderly and the room that we were assigned was way down the end of the corridor so the woman at the check-in desk moved us much closer to the elevators. It made our stay so much nicer. Will be glad when all the restaurants are opened.
30,A domestic violence incident involving an unknown family and a guy named Ricky occurred in the hallway right in front of my hotel room door. It was extremely scary. I attempted to contact the front desk/security and there was no answer.
40,Overall not a bad stay. There was the problem with having to call for towels and wash clothes and the a/c was not in the best condition. Also restaurants closing by 9p but the casino is always open that's kind of contradictory. Also thought that the casino floors were supposed to be non smoking!!!!!
30,Showers have only half a door so the floor gets soaked. Because the AC unit is a swamp cooler the room is unnecessarily humid all the time though especially after a shower. Also if you plan on getting drunk the room heats up and light starts coming through the window dressings at around 6 am. Location is too far south on the strip. Getting to the middle of the strip is a mile walk or $15 uber each way. Every day. Never stay in the pyramid. Tower rooms are a better option. Though at the time of writing the pyramid rooms are being remodeled at the expense of guests comfort. It's not the worst hotel. There are better in Vegas though.
40,Casino didn’t smell too strong of smoke and staff were pleasant. The woman checking us in have us a $50 room credit since we were on our honeymoon. However our hotel room had a pair of dirty underwear on the floor. Several of the restaurants were closed when we checked in at 12am which wasn’t ideal. They did have a 24/7 store open in the lobby with some snacks.
50,We really enjoyed our stay. This was our first time at Luxor. Staff accommodated us so that our family's rooms were close to each other. I would definitely recommend the Luxor for your next Vegas getaway.
40,Stayed in one of Luxor pyramid’s renovated rooms which was quite nice and comfortable. Close to the airport which was handy. Tried to reserve a spot at the pool but with difficulty…attendant seemed aloof and suggested reserving a cabana in order to get on the virtual waitlist. Otherwise a great stay and our room provided a quiet place.
10,For the price you are better off staying somewhere more central on the strip. The rooms have been redone but not well the showers are borderline dangerous for those with bad hips and knees and things like use of the fridge in the room that costs extra even though it wasn’t mentioned or advertised…
40,On our stay there were few trained staff and no concierge staff at all. I got bad directions from desk as to where my room elevator was located. It’s very confusing to find the right bank of elevators or to find staff anywhere but we’ll placed security personnel were there to do it all.  I got directions and travel advice from the great security staff. Bethany help direct me to travel books since the concierge was non existent.  Check in was difficult and frustrating as I got lost with 3 attempts to find some tower elevators hidden down a creepy turning hall. The desk manager finally walked me to the elevators. Security did the rest of everything. God bless those wonderful security staff and thanks again Bethany.
10,We called the front desk the first day of our trip to let them know our tv wasn't working and there was a heavy smell of weed coming from our AC. They said they would send someone out but no came out. We let them know again the next few days so we wont get charged for that. The water went out for a few hours threw out our 4 day stay. We had to go down to the casino to use the bathroom because there was no water in the toilet. For 3 out of the 4 days the closest elevator (2b) was closed causing a huge line to go up and come down from our room. We waited 30 mins at the elevator (4b) to go down when we decided to go down the fire escape like everyone else(8 flights of stairs). We ended up spending more time at our friends different hotel room to shower and rest because we didnt know if the water was working and the walk to the room was far less because the had working elevators
50,Not only were our suites nice and comfy but the food at the Luxor is phenomenal… the Public House is delicious and outstanding service!!! This is definitely my go to hotel and restaurant place in Vegas… the pyramid cafe is great and the server was awesome but I forgot his name! But he was a kind gentleman
10,Thank goodness we only stayed one night the public restrooms on the casino floor were FILTHY the elevators getting to our room were dirty you don’t even need a key card to get access the the elevators to the rooms. The only good thing is that the check in process was easy and could be done from my phone was even happier to check out of there.
20,The room was always warm. The toilet did not flush properly. The front desk staff were difficult to approach as there were never many on staff. The bell desk staff were rude. Neither issue was actually resolved. I normally have great experiences at mgm properties but this trip has made me ponder the options from Caesar.
30,It was an overall average to good stay. We will return we just hope they iron the kinks out. The service was slow when it came to the needs of the room the door wouldn’t close without slamming it the elevators were down.
10,The room didn’t have a refrigerator very loud vibration noise the entire time. Bathroom smelled like a sewer and it got even worse when the water in the sink came out. Wouldn’t recommend this to the homeless people on the streets.
10,Hotel accused me of stealing a smoke detector locked me out of the room for 4 hours only to find out housekeeping removed it first shift and never replaced.. was also accused of being high and tampering with smoke detector
50,Everything is great.....  Room was very clean very comfortable and affordable ..........  Casino is great and actually I won some money ......  Staff was friendly and very helpful  And I already planing to go again.... soon 😉
10,Rude staff. Accused of being a drug addict and stealing their smoke detector after experiencing an issue with the room key. Lack of compensation. Wasted 4 hours of the time of 13 people trying to resolve an issue that apparently was a miscommunication with their maintenance folks.
50,Luxor was a Beautiful property and is so convenient to the strip. It is connected to multiple properties mall resturants etc. I loved every minute I was there and hated to leave. The only thing I didn't get to do was swim at the beautiful pools while I was there.
30,I booked a 2bd corner suite (17040). It was nothing like I expected. The room smelled like poop and mildew. Needs new carpet wallpaper fresh coat of paint. Furniture is outdated. Please Renovate soon!
10,They gave us the wrong room. We reserved a two queen and received a one. They couldn’t change our rooms so had to get an uncomfortable roll-out bed. The AC was broken and it is 100 degrees at night. The room was not cleaned after the previous guests left. And there was no toilet paper. We called and asked for some and they kept saying they are sending someone- no one ever came. To make matters worse the staff was unwilling to help fix their errors. They were rude and even talked back. Worse experience I’ve ever had in a hotel and in Vegas. Other guests at the counter experienced the same issues. Please do yourself a favor and skip this hotel.
30,We had hoped by staying in a Suite that it would be really special with a great view of something more than just the ground and the bottoms of a bunch of bushes and trees but NOT and that was therefore very disappointing.
10,From construction to renovated rooms don’t waste your time. They only have half the elevators working. The water got shut off on us in the morning for no reason no explanation no apology. Incredibly long lines half the staff. Most the restaurants were at a half an hour to 45 minute wait but when you look at how many people they have sad the restaurant is basically empty.
40,I had a ton of fun here. Great place for fun but not the best hotel. But really how often are you in your room. The staff was mostly super friendly. The bar DJ was not nice but still had a good time over all. Would go back!
10,My ac unit was BROKEN my ENTIRE STAY. I was not offered to switch to another room with a WORKING ac unit. Instead I was giving a low blowing fan AFTER calling about my NON WORKING AC for the 3rd time in a day. If felt like I was staying in an OVERPRICE MOTEL room.
30,What more can I say the price was good but frequently standing in line for elevators and temporarily losing water supply with no warning were disappointing. Food and shopping options helped make up for the other shortcomings.
50,my husband bought me here for a birthday getaway. I enjoyed myself .. it will definitely be a birthday to remember! We frequently visit Vegas and this has been the best accommodating and romantic trip thus far!

50,enjoy it it was close to the my event and i also could walk down the strip to the Mirage and enjoy the site along LV blvd without driving and fight parking. My card got demagnetized twice and i could not get back into parking
10,From start to finish my stay was uncomfortable the elevator was down and not one ever gave us a heads up. Walk around the casino floor for minutes hulling our luggage which felt for ever with the heat. Once in the room hours later walk out to get ice to find out the machines in our floor were not working. That lead to more exploring and walking around going up and down stairs! Back at the room the bathroom didn’t have running water at that point decided to make that call that never got answered hours on hold. Sadly this wasn’t going to ruin my trip so I went out and gamble had drinks and made it the best.
50,Fantastic guest interface very helpful staff. This is a big hotel and the staff made the stay informative and welcoming. We were able to enjoy our rest with a comfortable bed and of course very much injoyed the ambiance.
10,I’m local. The stay was overpriced for the experience. The check in was late because the room wasn’t cleaned at the 3 pm check in time. The room was smoky. We did our own maintenance on a stopped up sink. We got stuck in the parking lot twice due to them giving us the wrong keys.
20,It pains me to say anything bad to a hotel I have frequented so often but this was without a doubt my worst experience for me and my party. The bad AC aside and minor housekeeping issues they give the impression they are open for business when the tram only works during the weekends none of the running walkways work half the escalators are working no buffet and to get into any other restaurant requires days in advance reservations. The hallway that connects the Excalibur with the Luxor has an AC that’s non functional it was extremely hot walking through there (and none of the running walkways were working). I understand COVID has made things difficult and cost cutting measures are necessary but not at the inconvenience to this magnitude. On top of all that my MLife credit credit card offered me nothing as their dedicated line moved from the far left of the registration desk to what appears to be the far right but is completely ripped off. Other guests had the same issue trying to get to it. It proved to be inconsequential as my friends who were not MLife card holders got their room right away and I was left waiting until 3pm. I’m just so disappointed with the Luxor now that I will most likely not be back.
50,We stayed in two rooms. Rooms were clean and spacious. ALL staff were on their game with respect and kindness. Made our stay feel very welcoming. It was a hot weekend but there is only so much Luxor can do about that lol. We'll be coming back for sure.
30,Was here for a weekend volleyball tournament recommend mobile check in- lines were ridiculous also get a physical key card especially if your utilizing the parking garage. Rooms overall were good room service cleaned everyday which was a plus because some hotels due to staff didn’t. We had the pyramid room so don’t expect luxury nice setup very roomy A/C in our room was giving us a full blast of cool air but I’m thinking because it’s old need upgrades- overall it was a good experience.
50,Great place to stay clean in a good place on the strip. Staff was friendly had no issues at all. The room was also very quiet so was able to get good sleep while there. Will definitely stay there again.
30,Rooms are very warm especially if you are facing Las Vegas Blvd. The AC systems in the room are very old and can't keep up with the heat of the sun beating in the windows even with the curtains closed all of the time and the lights off. We finally changed rooms after two nights of bad sleep from the room being too hot. The second room was better but not great. Also they only had one bank of elevators working in the pyramid. That meant very long walks to get from the elevator to your room everytime (and long waits). After walking around the strip it was very frustrating to know you still had a long walk to your room once you got off the elevator.
30,I enjoyed this hotel. The last time I stayed in Vegas it was at the Excalibur and this was way nicer. The rooms were clean updated and didn’t smell like weed. The updated rooms are nice. The shower gets all over a little bit. The location was great because we were in town for a volleyball tournament which was at Mandalay Bay. It was an easy indoor walk. The only problem is when you’re there for a tournament you get the stay and play rate which is higher than regular rates. I feel that we overpaid.
30,Room was warm and the shower wet the floor. Elevator was spotty at best could take 30 minutes to go up or down. Room was nice just got and wet. Room look good and well maintained but hard too cool. Shower pressure was amazing but wet the bathroom because there was no door.
10,I had a very unhappy trip. The room was less than basic. My friends at the Fairfield inn had a much nicer room with more amenities. There was no ice bucket no cups no microwave no fridge. The floor was dirty as if it hasn't been vacuumed for a long time. The walk to the room in the West Tower was so far and hard to carry everything into the room cuz they had no carts to put them on so I had to carry an ice chest that was heavy because they had no refrigeration. The room was dirty and had nothing in it but a small TV and a phone. Staff misinformed me when it came to check in forcing me to stand in a line for over an hour and a half when I didn't have to. When I called down to try to take care of something I had to wait in lines again. At the Fairfield inn my friends went in and we're checked in and 5 minutes and had a nice room and a good experience for a lot less money.
20,I stayed at the Luxor for 3 nights during my birthday weekend. The rooms are very outdated and repairs need to me made at the Luxor. The housekeeping service was horrible. We always had to call and ask for wash clothes. The housekeeper would only put towels in my room. I also rented a cabana. On the website it stated that my cabana would have a misting fan. I showed up to my cabana with no misting fan and it was over 100 degrees. I was extremely hot for the entire day. I would not recommend the Luxor.
50,Great room and service. Highly recommend. Beautiful resort and house keeping is very attentive. My kids loved the stay as well as myself. The casino itself is nice and clean. This resort is my main choice to stay.
50,I love location cleanliness and staff. Not happy because I was supposed to get a free room didn’t get it then charged an extra hundred dollars on my bill. Over all other then room fees we were happy with our stay
10,Horrible place to stay I stay in Luxor for my birthday and the tub valve broke and keep calling the office no one answer they fix it until 8:30 didn’t let me sleep and then they came and told me check was at 11
30,For a quick weekend get-away this hotel worked ok but there are much better options for just a few dollars more on the strip. They also seemed to be struggling with handling the crowds (maybe a staffing shortage?) as the front desk/lobby was always crowded and several areas were not maintained well i.e. hallways always laced with trash elevators and walkways down long wait times for drinks at the tables etc... That said the newly renovated rooms were nice and modern and the bed relatively comfortable so like I said for a quick weekend getaway it works. If you're staying longer than 2 or 3 days however I would recommend the New York New York MGM or Mirage. All relatively close in price and all with many more amenities.
20,Neighbors having loud sex and I had to explain that to a teenager bathroom light switch looked like it had dried blood no hand towels or wash cloths long wait times for guest services when calling. Room cleaning was better after the initial night.
20,Be vary wary of booking here there are hidden charges such as a $35 dollar a day so called {resort fee} charged and it is additionally taxed by another $4 making it $39 a day the additionally charged another $20 a day fo non valet parking $28 for valet. In effect this almost doubles the cost of the room. Additionally the hotel is severly understaffed check in is a night mare and there is a 10 to 15 minute wait for anyone to even answer a front desk phone. The rooms are old and shoddy and good luck getting anything to work right. There is no refriderator in the room to keep anything cold. Half the restaurants are still closed from the covid outbreak and all but the Pub burger offer substandard meals for the money charged. Dont eat at the primer steak house the salid was small and the so called ceaser dressing was not even close to ceaser dressing. The steaks are tender by dry and the served a baked potato with the steak that was half rotten and moldy $166 bucks for a horrible meal. Other than great decorations and motif this hotel just plain sucks so save your money.
50,The Luxor is a wonderful hotel and Casino to stay I. While in Vegas. It had something for every member of the family whether it be kids and or the adults! I truly enjoy staying her on my vacations!! It’s a true gem!!
10,My Family and I Checked in on a Friday night and selected the newer renovated room as soon as we got in the room we noticed how steamy the room was informed the front desk and the the housekeeping dept. and they stated that they will send a facility engineer to check the AC. Left the room for them to work on the issue however when we got back in the room it was still steaming hot. (Curtain were closed the entire time to avoid heat coming in the room) they provided a fan but it just made it worst heat circulating the room.

30,Hotel room was filthy. Front desk gave a new room as soon as we went down to complain. Outdated. Minor repairs need throughout. The saving grace for me was the people that work there. I understand during this day and time things are rough. (maybe need more housekeepers to help the ones there keep up).  All kind all willing to right any wrongs to make your stay comfortable. The front desk housekeeping the doormen valet etc. the employees were my favorite part of this hotel. The Luxor should be thankful for them.
50,This hotel was awesome and so clean. The staff was friendly. Only problem is we didn’t have a fridge or microwave in our room which was an inconvenience for keeping our drinks and snacks chilled. Check in was ok but couldn’t get the remote key to work on my phone
50,Stay 3 nights a Luxor for my girl’s 30th bday. Only issue I had was there was no mini fridge nor microwave. That would have made the trip so much better. It’s located close to the airport so that was definitely a plus.
10,We had roaches in our hotel room. No offer to move us only to spray the room. No accommodations were made just housekeeping services. I did not feel comfortable staying here at all. The food was amazing the room was awful.
10,They room was missing towels every day. No wash clothes or no hand towels or no step out towel. The bathroom had broken pieces on the wall and in the shower with minimal effort to fix. No room security
30,My room was not very presentable we had some issues where towels we’re undone and the room looked like it was not really cleaned before. We also had some electrical issues with the mini refrigerator and the separate living room had no lighting so it was pretty dark there. The location isn’t too bad.
10,"We stayed at Luxor for my daughter's SCVA Volleyball tournament. We had NO choice to stay elsewhere since the contract is Luxor in order to attend the SCVA. I lived in California for 40 years - I have been to Las Vegas countless times - I have never stayed at Luxor until now. This has been by far the worst experience at any hotel or Motel. Parking - the smell of Weed/Cannabis will hit you from the moment you drive in. Check-In - Extremely Long Lines slow service even with the Online choice. Elevators - only one side working the 4A and $B elevators. Meaning that if you had a room on 12th floor - you would walk approximately 1 mile to reach your room and drag your luggage. The AC system in the room is weak barely working. The food choices are Mediocre at best and Expensive - $50+ for a steak at Strip Steak or $30.00 for 2 Fajita's at Diablo's. The quality of the people inside the casino is deplorable. Expect to see women in thongs covered by fish-nets people drinking out of Hennessy Bottles' colorful language. The Pool - wow! Do not bring your kids there I will leave it at that. I do have to say that Vegas has become nothing more than a "" money grab"" and it simply reflects in most casinos. Everything is ridiculously priced resort fees parking fees add-on taxes late checkout fees Taxi cost etc All this would probably be forgiven if the experience would match it. It doesnt!"
10,"Facility upkeep. While the remodeled rooms are nice they are dingy. Maintenance of the building systems is lacking to say the least. For the entire duration of our stay we had to take quick showers (under 5 minutes total) for two adults due to the shower pan not draining. Maintenance was requested only after 35-minutes of waiting for someone to pick up. We received no follow-up only came back to boot scuff marks on the tile and in the pan indicating someone was there. Whatever he did did not correct the problem and a second call was made and again we were promised it would be remedied. It was not. On the final morning of our stay the sink backed up wouldn't drain for nearly 15-minutes and when it did it gurgled what appeared to be food chunks or vomit back into the sink. There were multiple fire alarm pull boxes that looked as though we're hanging on by a thread. The carpet along the corridors was heavily soiled. The elevator nearest our room was inoperable for the entire stay. This was not shared with us at check-in. It did not appear that the pool filtration was functioning during occupied hours as there were significant ""floaties"" in all pools we visited. The wifi indicated a strong signal but was very ineffective. This is not good for a facility that supports digital keys often requiring us to return to the main floor open the app and then hope it stayed connected to access the key."
10,Elevators didn't work water got turned off loud construction starting at 7am long lines everywhere rude/unhelpful staff. Not warned about any of this. Had to lug our luggage down 7 flights of stairs!

40,Luxor is and always will be an absolute favorite of my wife and I we stay here anytime we get a chance and almost exclusively stay only here because we know what we are getting and that is great service amazing prices and the upmost quality in experience as far as Las Vegas. The rooms could use an upgrade but honestly what rooms in Vegas couldn’t? The whole reason your in Vegas is just that to be in Vegas not a dang hotel room get out and explore!
20,I will be calling the hotel as we had to change rooms due to the a/c not working. The hallway smelled like mildew and then when we took the elevators they were boarded up in plywood??? We felt like we were in a casket. Our room was supposed to be a newer one but the refrigerator had been taken out. There were hair balls on the ground and on the towels. Nothing seemed to have been cleaned or said that precautions were being used for COVID. Speaking to guest services was not easy. Using the phone I was on hold for more than 10 minutes both times and the line was always so long at the front desk there was never time to stand there. That being said leaving the parking garage required an actual key which of course would have required standing in line. I'm also not sure why the pool closed at 6pm when the better part of the day to be outside would be the evening. I plan on receiving a refund for the resort fee. There were no extras that I used or were provided.
40,Great place to stay as your first visit to Las Vegas. Exceptional staff and ambiance. The view from any room in the pyramid is unique. Only complaint was that our room was SO hot. Air conditioning did not work and we were told that there was no way to fix it. Besides that we always choose Luxor as budget friendly.
10,Unless you love the smell of marijuana and you love trying to fall asleep while a dog is non stop barking do not stay at this hotel. The hotel associates will do nothing to accommodate you (they won’t relocate your room nor will they address the marijuana issue or the dog issue). For a hotel that has signage all over claiming marijuana smoking isn’t permitted they certainly don’t care even if your guests call and complain about their room and personal belongings reaking of pot.
10,Our room was extremely hot. We asked for the AC to be fixed and were told that it was working properly. My kids had to sleep in their underwear at night it was so hot. We were told they would bring us a fan but when we called the next day we were told that they didn’t have enough fans.    I can’t believe they would rent a hotel room in Las Vegas during 100° weather with AC units that don’t function enough to cool the room. We try to spend as much time possible outside of the room and outside of the Luxor Hotel all together for that matter. There are so many choices for a hotel in Vegas I’ll certainly pick something different next time.
10,Had the nastiest ever Vegas experience. Luxor had roaches in their “new” remodel tower rooms. I can’t express how nasty of experience that was. Couldn’t even sleep thinking there were roaches in the room.
50,Very nice and hotel. The staff was friendly and also spoke and ask if we needed anything. I especially like the stores and restaurants that was located in the hotel. It was an overall very great experience and will be back for a visit
50,"Friday noon my friend and I decided to go to Las Vegas for one night. The Receptionist (Ms. Adelina) was fantastic and patient with us. She was even able to get our rooms next to each other.  Only negative is finding your way around is taxing oh and the Pyramid Restaurant did not have the hamburger the Hotel advertised. They said ""it"" was at the other restaurant."
30,Disappointed with the basic feel of the room. Overall aesthetic was rundown. Remodel is in great need through out. Problems with the mobile check in and out process. Ran into issues with parking and employees communicating need to obtain a parking voucher when checking in.
10,"We absolutely love MGM properties and we were so excited to celebrate our 30th birthdays at the Luxor. They always treat us so well and we have the best stay! This time was unfortunately completely different. We spent a lot of money on a cabana where we had the worst service ever and had to walk to order all of our own food and drinks. We had a poor experience at the restaurant Public House and were not even recognized for it being our birthday although I made reservations weeks in advance. It was our first stay in a Penthouse Suite to celebrate our 30th birthday. We waited in the ""vip line"" multiple times for upwards over an hour. We couldn't check in until after 4 and then were given wrong directions which led us to the wrong tower with lots and lots of stuff. The room was filled with many portable air conditioners and it was so hot. So hot in fact that some of our guests had to leave from feeling ill. The maids were trying to clean at 8am even though we had do not disturb and hadn't got checked in until late. We were so excited for our first stay in the Penthouse Suite but it was the worst hotel experience I have ever had. I advise you to stay away from Luxor at all costs. I tried complaining multiple times about these issues and I was just sent away. Worst customer service ever! I wish I could have taken my money anywhere else but with them! Our 30th birthday experience and first time in the penthouse was ruined with not a care in the world for any type of resolution!"
10,"While in town for a 4 day volleyball tournament with my teenaged daughter our team was assigned the Luxor as our residing hotel. Knowing that the area in the southern part of the strip was a bit sketchy we had low expectations of what staying at the Luxor would be like. Come to find that even low expectations at this property are too high. The title of this review is what was said to me on the second morning when my daughter and I were walking to breakfast and we saw two workers one frantically cleaning the door to one of the rooms and the second cutting out about a 6 foot by two foot section of carpet that was soaked in blood. "" The dude he got stabbed"". I was prepared for a pretty dirty suite ( or what passes for a suite at the Luxor) check for poor service double check as our suite did not have A.C. for 24 hours during Vegas' 109 degree temperature on Thursday night- Friday night. ( ""maintenance is very busy""). The Luxor should not be on anybody's list of where to stay in Las Vegas no matter how low the nightly cost is. It is dirty the service basically comical in nature but most importantly the place in NOT SAFE. "" The dude he got stabbed"""
20,Worst experience ever for my grandparents this was their first flight ever and first time in las vegas and because the elevator was broke and the walk trying to get to their room was so long they stayed in the room just about from Thursday till Sunday
30,Service and staff could have Been Better didn't like how they just use their master key to say just checking on you. You never know if I was in there doing something or getting dressed give Better direction
20,This experience has been far below anything I expected. The room has a sewer smell coming from the air conditioner there are no privacy locks on the doors and the maids just burst in the room twice we requested a refrigerator and it was so n old room had no microwave or coffee pot and the food in the hotel deli is nasty and too expensive.
20,Had to pay for parking when staying at the resort. No refrigerator in room. Staff always busy. Was supposed to be in the pyramid it was placed in the second tower unbeknownst to us and we couldn’t find our room for 25 minutes.
20,Expected more from a MGM property in Vegas. The rooms are outdated. There aren't additional ways to lock the entry door while in the room. No security chain or manual lock. The air conditioning in our room intermittently struggled to keep the room cool. The walkways in front of the rooms on our floor were always in need of cleaning during our five night stay.    The elevators that were close to our room were out of service due to construction until the day before we checked out. We had to walk a very long way from the other elevators to our room. Most of the time we had to wait in line to use the elevators. The restaurants in the hotel and connected  restaurants with the Mandalay hotel are definitely the bright spots.
10,Found some blood on my sheets still so welcome to Vegas I guess. The bathrooms were dirty and looks like the previous guests hair was still all over the place. You’d expect a clean room but not here.    I was lucky enough to have a room next to a construction zone I guess because a hour after A night full of gambling I’m woken up to power tools. Not fun when you’re a nocturnal gambler.
20,The in room air conditioner was non-functional. Good times in 107 degree heat. Nothing done. Bathroom fan is disturbingly loud. Casino itself is pleasant and enjoyable. Titanic and location is good but tram is only on fri-sun.
20,Staff in the stores were rude and demanding. The bathroom in my room had hair all over it. There were no wash clothes and when I asked for one I was told they didn’t have any. It’s difficult to find your way around. Just not a good experience there.
20,Ac hardly work no water for basically a day room was nice not so clean found earring on the floor and other small trash only bad reviews is that other than that the hotel is nice but ac hardly even working when it 90 plus outside not the business and no water so u can shower no thanks
10,We had no towels in our room upon arrival. We paid for late checkout but got locked out of our rooms at 11am the standard checkout time. It took an hour to get the situation resolved because the hotel is understaffed and overwhelmed.
10,Do not stay here. Avoid digital check in. It is a useless info grab and you still end up waiting at the desk. No in room coffee. Huge line at starbucks is your only option. Many restaurants still closed. Pyramid exterior is neat but dreary inside. Physically isolated from greater offerings on the strip yet an abysmal attempt to be self contained and keep your dollars. Advertises health and safety measures. Chat with employee revealed management is more interested in their incentives then providing proper supplies. What a rip off.
20,The halls and trash near the elevators were not clean get filthy. Construction going on very loud my daughter had an very important volleyball tournament and we were not able to sleep. Very disappointed in the hotel. Compensate me or comp me rooms
40,Parking was expensive and can be hard to find a spot pool and restaurants close early and had to call the front desk several times to resolve a clogged shower. However the stay was still enjoyable. The updated Tower rooms are nice and fairly chic with comfortable beds. The daybed at the pool was an awesome experience!
20,Very poor quality of climate control in the hotel rooms. When you are in Vegas you want a place to escape the heat during the day. Unfortunately if you have chosen to stay at the Luxor you will get no reprieve in your hotel room!
10,Stay at the Luxor for our anniversary and check in was a breeze on the app and it’s sad that was the highlight of our trip. Elevators were down on our side of the hotel so we had to walk around to the other side to use those which were always busty as 4 elevators for all the floors and the staff we asked didn’t even know those elevators were down. We lost water for an hour and our air conditioning wouldn’t get the room below 77 degrees. Had to ask for wash rags. None of the walking escalators were working. And couldn’t even give us a fan to help cool off room
10,Worst Vegas hotel experience keys electronic or actual key cards never worked had to try multiple times thank good someone was always in room to let me in. Never staying here again not worth the trouble at the price
20,I checked in to an overpriced suite (compared to other hotels) and it stunk really bad of cigarette smoke and weed. I know the signs in every room state all rooms are non-smoking but that does not deter people. I complained and 4 hours later sent someone up with a deodorizer that masked the smell for a few hours. Couldn't stay in that room another 3 nights. Also the carpets were filthy with stains and dog pee as they allow pets.  Casino was also filled with smoke all day and night as the high ceiling does allow for proper ventilation and it all sits at ground level. Went to 4 other casinos and they were much better.
20,We stayed at Luxor for our Honeymoon. It’s one of those hotels in Vegas everyone just needs to check off the bucket list. My recommendation make it just one night! Service is poor and blamed on COVID!!!
20,Rooms very outdated. Smoke smell. Elevators inoperative or turned off. Bars closed or very under staffed. Water turned off noon till two daily. None of these problems were disclosed prior to check in. Have been to Vegas 9 times never so disappointed. Tenders steakhouse very exceptional well worth the visit to Luxor. Pool area ok. Employees were good with what they had to work with. Will not stay they again.
50,Great Hotel tower rooms are nice but could use a little maintenance in some areas. Overall I would stay again. The staff is very friendly and eager to please. The self parking is a little difficult to locate and figure out. After that it's easy. Great atmosphere and great food.
30,Stay was okay. Started out rough and bumpy but eventually turned out ok. Some staff was friendlier than others. No microwaves or refrigerators in the rooms were a problem. My husband uses insulin so we had to request for fridge which we received.
30,Like I said my room was hot never got a upgrade ... sometimes the drinks were not very strong at all ... wait staff wasn’t very Attentive to people gambling and getting drinks around fast enough to get me drunk enough to gamble more
10,The front desk made a mistake and never charged us incidentals then 5 security guards were sent to our door over a mistake the front desk made. Security was extremely rude for them to be knocking on the door at midnight and stating they were going to kick down the door. When we got to the front desk like they demanded we had to wait 15 minutes for anyone to even speak with us. The manager came over Jesus Caberra and was no help at all. After speaking with him he then tried to add another $50 charge to our bill to cover his own behind for not charging us incidentals when we first checked in. When we expressed our main issue was not the bill (or the mistake they would’ve never noticed if we had not said anything) but with security the manager stated he was not over security and could not do anything about their behavior. Even the worker Eric stated that the way security behaved was inappropriate. Separately the walls of the hotel are extremely thin and we could hear everything in the room next to us. After the incident with security our neighbors were arguing from 5am-8:30am but we didn’t want to call security due to how they treated us over a minor misunderstanding. We could only imagine them handling an actual dispute where emotions were already high. We’ve been to Vegas many times before and this was our worst hotel experience. Our party was 13 people and all of us had issues upon check in that came due to lack of knowledge from the staff.
20,We stayed in the tower rooms and both of our rooms had beyond moldy and nasty showers and toilets. We encountered issue after issue at this hotel conflicting information from staff and water being shut off to our room. We won’t be going back to this property ever again.
10,Came to the Lexar hotel for a volleyball tournament. I was highly disappointed in the quality of the rooms and the cleaning services. I paid for the premium pyramid room expecting that room to be updated as it states on its website. The furniture in the room is old and outdated.￼There are no charging stations for your phones or computers. We had to unplug a desk lamp to charge our phones. The room was not especially clean when we came in. Housekeeping had not removed food from the refrigerator from the previous gas. The TV is outdated and the quality of the picture is very grainy. They don’t￼ Have any media platforms such as Netflix or Hulu. There was no coffee maker in the room. Who doesn’t have a coffee maker? The white bathroom towels are now a faded gray and very rough. Do not stay here unless you are getting a super cheap deal. I expect much more out of Vegas and MGM properties!
20,Check in online its great but thats the only thing that was great. Had to change rooms because our room was very dirty. If you want to eat breakfast get up early nothing but the pyrmid cafe and its a long wait.We will be staying else where our next visit.
10,We got there on a Sunday and it was crazy. We got to the hotel around 10am and trying to scan the QR link was horrible. For some reason we did not have good reception and it would not work. They sent us to a desk (which is where we went first and was told to sign in under the QR code) and they got us signed in and was texted around 4pm our room was finally ready.  Well let me just say that the whole hotel smelled of weed and musky-mold. I know weed is legal in NV and smelling it off and on the strip is ok but the smell was throughout the entire hotel. Once we got on our floor (25th) it smelled worse and when we got in our room while spacious smelled of musty clothes and cigarettes. We did a quick walk through and tried to unpack but it was too hot in our room (seemed like the air was only blowing out hot air) so we stopped and went to dinner and walked the strip for a few. When we got back k we started unpacking more and was starting to notice uncleanness here and there. I paid it no mind at first as I knew it was a holiday weekend and the hotel was very busy but I was on my honeymoon so we ordered a suite and wanted to enjoy the perks of the room. Welp the soaker tub had old scum residue on the sides here the seats were. Once I saw that I was disappointed and appalled! We called down to the lobby to inform them and because of the capacity of that nights stay they were going to send housekeeping up and solve the issues for the evening and would move us if they could in the am. OK no big deal but after 2+ hrs of waiting we called back down and was told that shift change was happening in 30 min so it would be at least another hr. We told them we were tired and would just move tomorrow.  So Monday am came and we got moved to the towers. Smelled so much better and rooms looks and felt nicer too. But that was it! Nothing more no sorry no here's a comp nothing. It seemed like it was no big deal they put us in a dirty room!  Honestly if I had not already paid for our hotel upfront I would have left and went somewhere else for the rest of our trip. The vibe at Luxor is cheap and honestly trashy. For the price the rooms are big they are trying to remodel it but it's just blah. No real attractions during the weekday and not much choice in food. The Diablos Mexican food was amazing through!  All in all we will never stay again! We started off with a huge letdown and it just went down hill from there.  If you are looking for cheap this is your place but stay in the towers NOT the Pyramid!  One star for Diablos! That's the only thing the had going for them...
10,We stayed in a king corner suite and it was filthy outdated bathroom lock was broken hot tub had hair cracks and looks unusable. The room sleeps three but the couch did not fold out to a bed and was very dirty. The elevator was way on the other side of the pyamid and it was a very long walk to get to. A few cocktail waitresses were rude and seemed like they were unhappy with their job.
10,We stayed 2 nights in 8139 on 6/1/21 through 6/3/21. We did get to check in early which was great. However the experience was horrible from there. The AC in our room didn’t barely work and the temperature in our room was 90 degrees. After multiple attempts to call the front desk we requested a fan & extra pillows and never received them. There was construction in the room surrounding us and our water was turned off multiple times during our stay with no advance notice. Why would you put guests in this room? The disregard for our comfort and enjoyment of our first vacation since the pandemic was absolutely disrespectful. Unfortunately the front desk was never available during our stay to try and remedy the inconveniences we experienced. We will return to Vegas this year but will not stay at Luxor probably not any MGM property if this is the manner MGM treats their guests. I will be posting this review publicly in order to protect other hard working folks from getting the shaft from MGM in the future.
40,Just a few notes... One should download the proper app for check in. With the app you will be notified when your room is ready. If you do not use the app be prepared to wait in line to check in and this could take over an hour to an hour and a half. No Coke anywhere. TV is old school not HDTV.
10,Water ran in the room for 2 hours with no help from staff. Had to call twice to get someone up for help. Called desk multiple times with no answer at all. Do not recommend the resort no movie channel provided when paying resort fees there should be at least one movie channel.
10,Even after reading many many reviews stating the a/c in the rooms was inadequate & that there was a pungent marijuana smell everywhere on the property I still had to see for myself. I came I stayed I saw. I will not make that mistake again. The marijuana smell is everywhere: the rooms the elevators where you wait for Uber; you simply can’t escape it. One Uber driver told us that The Luxor apparently attracts many many marijuana smokers. He said that his car reeks of marijuana after picking up many Luxor guests. It’s is hard to describe how pungent that odor is on this property.    The lack of adequate air conditioning in the hotel rooms made our stay unpleasant. Our first room was a “remodeled” Pyramid room. First of all they are using the word “remodeled” very loosely in my opinion. The room was unbearably hot. Maintenance came but could do nothing to help. We were moved to a Tower room by the very nice & helpful front desk staff. The room was nicer newer-ish but the a/c was still inadequate. Yes Las Vegas is hot in June but I’ve stayed in other hotels that managed to keep a comfortable temperature in the rooms.    Many of The Luxor restaurants are either closed or have limited hours. This was an issue as everyone must cram into the limited restaurants.    I really wanted to like this property as I like staying in MGM properties but I won’t be back to The Luxor and I would not recommend it to my friends.
50,Attention to detail and service! Also between all other services to include alternate hospitality establishment was superb. We shall be returning soon and we are also hoping to experience the same values we just did. Thank you Luxor/MGM. 😊
50,All around great experience. Clean room great service. Very helpful as far as direction of there hotel. I would recommend there hotel to any one that’s looking for comfort . Check out was easy and fast. And they don’t hold your deposit like other hotels. Save day return.
30,Room was messed up when we checked in. Had to stand in line for an hour to get it fixed. Then the air-conditioning didn't work. After waiting untill 1030 p.m. forsomeone to look at it i wastold there was nothing they could do and we'd have to deal with it.
30,So I was expecting more of an experience more grandeur I guess. but it was Basic pillows were ok no wash cloths or towels hotel very busy but no bells or whistles just meh....  The pool area was probably the highlight of the entire trip
10,I love the Luxor but these new room remodels specifically the bathroom is a main reason to not stay there again ... The person who designed this without a shower door and the people who approved this should be fired .... No matter what you do the floor gets soaked and the door to the bathroom already has water damage ... It breaks my heart that this stupidity is happening to a place I do love staying at. Its disgusting and a danger to a persons safety and health.
30,After a long period of time we got back to LV . First time at Luxor and not a very good experience. Everything was ok until that bad experience with the hotel construction wich made our stay not very comfortable. But we hope next time it will be better.
10,Room was so hot we were sweating watching Tv. We requested a fan but it never came. We also got billed $50 for someone else’s meal! Called to speak with someone left a message and haven’t heard back. The lady that took my call about the food charge was so rude too!
30,My stay was okay! No one went above and beyond to make our experience outstanding. The air conditioning unit within our room worked intermittently leaving us in a room temperature ranging from 69 degrees to 77 degrees. Not a comfortable temperature in triple degree weather.
20,Upset with luxor. I expected more. I understand they're remodeling but it caused a major inconvenience. Early morning drilling and banging woke me up like i was directly in the room being remodeled. They cut the water off for a time when i needed to use the bathroom to take a shower and clean up. You have to pay for a fridge if think that should've been free for all the headaches i went through. I had to call front desk over a hour to get a new tv remote. These are things that should be checked Prior to check in. And you'd figure management would make things right and all I got was a sorry. Not acceptable. Im sure i wasn't the only one that felt this way.
20,Rooms are old and beat up suites show couches but only have a couple beat up chairs. AC and ventilation system barely works felt like a motel. Casino and rest of the property was in better shape but carpets everywhere were dirty.
40,Service was great but more attention to cleanliness of common areas especially by elevators. The overall value of my money spent was good but you it can be improved.. maint man Lucio was a real gentleman. Thank you to him
20,This hotel was on the low end as far as price per night but everything else in it was ridiculously expensive. The food was low quality and overpriced. The place needs to be updated! I would rather pay more a night and stay less time than to stay here again!
20,My stay at Luxor wasn't a good at I would recommend anyone to this casino in the future. The customer services need improvement bad and should learn how to speak to the guests and learn how to treat them in the future
10,Terrible experience. Issues with shower Ac. No fridge. Room wasn’t as pictures. They took more money than they were suppose to take. Dirty towels & sheets!!. Not worth the prices listed on website go to another hotel
20,The hotel in general is in disrepair and generally unclean it reeks of cigarette smoke they did not include a microwave in the room which we found very predatory because you’re unable to have even a simple late night snack or reheat your leftovers forcing you to instead go downstairs to buy their incredibly overpriced items if Soto was going for about five dollars a bottle if there even is assuming you can even find a location that’s open there was dog poop in the hallway and trash from other guest sitting out side their doors for over 24 hours before it was finally cleaned up the elevators shake and rattle are very scratched and dinged up
50,The hotel it self is very expensive outside of the room charge. The rooms are basic but your paying over 200 something dollars for one that doesn’t even come with a microwave or a refrigerator which is ridiculous if you ask me but other than that the hotel is nice there is a strip that it sits on so everything in there or on the strip is ridiculously expensive go to a 7/11 or a convenient store
30,We paid for early check in we get there and they took almost 1 hr to point us off too the self keys and to get the software to update then we go up to room which they stated it was ready carrying all our stuff no help offered and the room was dirty hair in the shower toilet paper in the ceilings and dirty tape on the walls we called the front desk it took a bit to answer are call the lady in the phone was nice she stated she would switch are room and she stated it was done auto on the app the key didnt work then i had to go down and the key make her with the app did not work i had to get someone to help and that person threw me in the long line to wait to be help by the time i was done regular checking was there they claimed to adjust the early check in fee and all resort fees but on the app i was charged the difference of room plus all the fees. When it showed i called again and they stated rudely it was done and it wouldn’t show until i was charged and that until i left i got my receipt. Then most all restaurants were closed in the hotel so we had to walk miles to other hotels to eat we did go to the pool and there was trash from people everywhere. Check out on the app was fast however reception to get it too load was horrible wifi never worked and our phones company barely worked too it was like we were blocked there all other hotels no problem
50,The Luxor is an awesome hotel.The Egyptian theme and building are so amazing..check-in is a bit crazy with long line and wait time for a room.The casino and restaurant/bars are good but a bit pricey.The beds where a little to hard/firm for my taste.The pool area is very large and clean..Over all we had a great time.
20,We paid to get a “renovated room” and the toilet seal was already coming off and our bathroom flooded. We called for it to be fixed after an hour we called again they told us we reported that our sink was overflowing we told them that was incorrect we had told them our toilet was leaking and they told us they didn’t know how long it would take to send someone over so we had to change rooms. They put us on the construction side and we had to walk at least a half mile to the nearest working elevator. And the casino was hot like the air wasn’t working. In our new room the air would turn off in the middle of the night and we would wake up sweating
10,Woken up by loud drilling and banging noises/vibrations at early times on multiple days. Renovations? Couldn’t sleep. Water to room was shut off too so couldn’t shower/shave/brush teeth. No advance warning given before this extreme disruption (no mention during booking at check-in or via pamphleting rooms). Noted that a neighbor complained about this and they seemed to call security on him as if he was in the wrong for being very upset about not being able to rest peacefully or wash up in the hotel room he probably paid good money for. This experience defined and overshadowed the entire stay.
50,Short and simple enjoy your time don't worry about anything else also can't forget about check in check in and out was awesome with the MGM app. Thank you MGM for that. No lines no wait just head straight to your room and get settled
30,The rooms are in need of updating and carpeting was really dirty. Location is at the end of the strip near Mandalay Bay so we did a lot of walking. Overall staff was friendly and we all enjoyed our time in Vegas!
40,Hotel was great as to be expected it was very big and confusing to get around but nice. As to be expected there was smoke smell through the check-in but room was great and no smoke smells. The bed initially felt like it would be uncomfortable but it was great me and my partner had a great sleep and bed was extremely comfortable. The stay was a last minute stay due to my flight back being delayed and it was so worth it. Only downside was it being a little ways from everything on the strip not sure I would want to stay if I was looking for the Vegas scene but something lowkey and chill it would be great! Other downside is the pool closes at 6pm like what its Vegas and hot all the time the sun isn't even down at 6. Other than that the stay was great!
30,Overall was a good stay Vegas seems to be going thru a rebirth on how to fully function again. So give it time. Hotels/ Casinos still understaffed and current staff overwhelmed with work load to make it run smoothly in this Hotel and other venues ie Restaurants Stores etc.
30,When arriving to the hotel it took us around an hour to check in and then to find our room. The hotel does not have good signs to give directions. On one afternoon while riding the elevator with a hotel employee she expressed her frustration with the difficulties she experienced finding her way around the hotel (as she had only been working there for a little under a month). We stayed at the Luxor for 4 nights. The elevators were constantly experiencing difficulties (making it difficult to get up and down). Every ride that we had on them was interesting! A ride on those elevators feels like a ride on a scary amusement park ride. They tilt and feel a bit unsafe. The rooms are pretty. However our bathroom was covered in hair (from the previous visitors) and the bath towels that were left (on two mornings) had blood stains and hair on them. There was not one time during our 4 1/2 days there that we left our rooms and didn’t see bags of laundry and trash lining the hallways. Though this is definitely not the worst hotel that you could stay at Vegas has so many options (within the same price range). It is definitely worth staying somewhere other than the Luxor!
10,Horrible. Old and outdated. Not even a fridge and microwave. Definitely not anything like I was expecting. The iron ruined my shirt. The walks are beyond ridiculous no parking lot and the air barely worked. Took the water 15minutes to get hot. Not worth the cost.
30,I didn’t have a good experience because I had to walk around to the pyramid to get to my room and the room didn’t come with no appliances and the beverage machine was sold out on my floor the entire time I was there.
10,I had trouble with the hotel water. Called reception and they took forever to answer. Later the water came back up i turned it on and it was black water so disgusting! Also the pool closes at 6pm which is absurd because that too early. The reception line is also super long you have to be waiting there for more than 15 minutes
10,Our room stunk of marijuana very badly. I was glad that we had chosen to stay only one night because the odor was somewhat sickening. Our bags still have a bit of a hue of stink. We wanted to sample the resort because we were intrigued by the theme and we really liked the pyramid room layout. However the smell completely ruined the experience. We stayed at three different properties on this trip and the likelihood of us returning to Luxor is extremely low.
20,This past weekend my boyfriend and I decided to go to the Luxor for Las Vegas and celebrate our mini getaway for memorial. Once we arrived I was unable to upgrade the room because there was no availability I also tried to check into my room but the lines were very complicated there was no direction and no way help. When I got to my room the products in the bathroom where used and the seal was broken on the shampoo and lotion . We were very worried about the sanitation . Definitely not going back there for awhile
50,Had a great time in Las Vegas. Stayed a room in the Luxor facing Mandalay Bay. It was a nice site and the hotel was nice. Was not able to do the Bodies Museum nor the Titanic because they close are 5 sharp.
30,Stayed there 5/27 - 5/31 for my husband’s birthday. The bathroom and the bathroom’s caulking looked beat up. I’m thinking during Covid they should’ve had time to redo all those rooms and make them look clean and decent. Mind you we opted to stay in the newer west towers as an upgrade Not a good job on the caulking to begin with. Sloppy Job. Makes the bathrooms look funky.  On Friday we left for the day and when we got back at night we couldn’t get in our room. Apparently our cards were demagnetized which they said often happens when someone tries to get in with their key to your room. They said it demagnetizes their room and yours. We went down there to try to get our cards remagnetized again and were told to stand in that one hour serpent like line. I became upset and asked to speak to a manager. I found it silly to have to wait in the check-in line again for something that could be fixed so easily especially when we had waited in line the night before to check in. The representative walked us over to the desk and was able to immediately get our cards remagnetized. Then the next day before we left I asked my husband to try the cards in the morning while I was still in the room. He did it and the cards were not working yet again. We called and were told that the reason the cards were not working is because we needed new keys since we extended our stay. I explained to her that we had not extended our stay but a month ago when we made the reservations I paid an extra night then. I explained to her that no one had informed us that there would be a second set of keys. She apologized and that someone would bring a new set of cards up to our room and apologized for the inconvenience. After a few minutes we called again to see how long it would be and where then told that by a rep named Phillip that Luxor does NOT bring keys to the room and that we have to go down yet again to pick up new cards again. So I asked him why should I believe him over her? He said he didn’t know and that he could not find any notes in the computer and that they do not do that. I asked him why not when we have been inconvenienced two times now by this whole process. He said he didn’t know but to come to the desk to pick the cards up. That was still a fiasco we went from one end of the desk to the other and still no one could give us a new key with no one able to help us or guide us correctly.  I did like that they have sheer curtains and dark curtains curtains which makes your room completely feel and look like night time when you’re closer. The beds were comfortable and so were the pillows. I like that there’s a lot of water coming out of the shower heads. I do not like that there were no refrigerators or microwaves. Everyone keeps saying Covid but what does Covid have to do with not having a fridge or a microwave. I mean you use the toilet the tub the sink sleep on the bed etc.. which I’m sure they don’t change the mattresses and pillows every day so I don’t understand the rationale behind this other than they’re just trying to get you to spend all your money in there and They keep raising the prices without caring about their customers and don’t want to spend on fridges and microwaves.
10,"Please call 760.668.7050 ""Mobile Check In"" doesn't allow to see the bill. Your assumption is it was correct & was not! We were NOT comp'ed the 1 night as promised. Waited 2 hours for frig which was needed for medicine. Water problems with no water to shower bath flush or wash hands was extremely unsanitary. Was NOT comp'ed 3 days for this. Only 1. Pools not open. Restaurants on property didn't give points for dining. SMH Please call 760.668.7050"
50,Great experience. Pool room food drinks employees location were all great. I would recommend it to everyone. The closest hotel to the airport quick check-in and check-out. Clean and the new air cleaners in the rooms are awesome.
10,When I arrived the lines were ridiculous. Finally get in my room and there was vomit on the carpet that I stepped in! Was moved to another room with only one bed instead of two. I was not provided any face towels. When we asked for face towels we were told we couldn't have any until the following day. There was lipstick stains on the sheets and the remote for the TV did not work. Requested a new one three times. It finally came the night before checkout. Very disappointed in the stay.
40,We had a wonderful time while visiting Luxor! Our room was beautiful and the service was great! We had dinner at Public House and Tender while there which was also wonderful! Thank you to MGM for a great offer!!
50,Very convenient-Excellent location to shops restaurants points of interest. I have stayed at other hotels on the strip but this has to be my favorite. Staff is very accomodating and the rooms are newly renovated.
10,The room wasn’t clean and it was a challenge to move to another room. Reception couldn’t help us cause we had a corner suite and there weren’t others available. The room had no AC in the room. So we had to be in a room we didn’t like nor was useful.
20,It's a older hotel the pyramid elevators were slow and one of them was possessed and did it's own thing did not stop on our floor going up then went down then went back up again to the top floor and kept opening at all floors then finally when it opened on our floor it wanted to close the door so quickly luckily we got out of that evil elevator.
10,The hotel just give a depressing vibe the room smells elevators stink and are not taken care of. Overall hotel gives depressing vibe . We left 3 days early and went to Mandalay Bay . I wouldn’t recommend this hotel to my worst enemy !!
10,The room did not have a microwave or refrigerator. There was a terrible sewage smell. We ordered Door Dash as room service was (understandably) unavailable. The first time we ordered Door Dash the delivery person was allowed to deliver the food to our room 3321. The second time we ordered the front desk would not allow the delivery person to bring the food to our room. We were unable to go down and retrieve the food and never received our order. When I questioned the front desk staff about the inconsistency they were rude and dismissive.
30,Room cleaning could be better staff are friendly. Guest room walls are thin you can almost hear whole conversations through the walls. Pool area has plenty of seating and the pools were not overly crowded.
50,I just loved the Luxor. The Egyptian Decour was absolutely amazing. Everyone was very kind and respectful. The room was simple but nice and everything was clean. My two very small dislikes were that the room seem to get real hot in the middle of the night and that the pool closed so early.
10,Mobile check in is not Available after midnight and somehow someway the wait time to check in is longer at that time than 4 o’clock. They also don’t help Mlife members after 10 PM. So its pretty much one single long line with two staff members.
10,Lack of security class and customer service! Fist fights in hallways going towards the rooms. Machines are sticky and dirty! To many people in there that are not gambling and lounging in the casino!!!
40,Luxor was a nice hotel. Cleanliness is amazing but noise levels late at night were a bit high which made it difficult to sleep. The AC worked well in the late hours but the rooms were not cool when the temperature was hot outside.
20,"I think I would have had a bigger/better room at a much cheaper price if I would have stayed at a Days Inn. The first night we stayed in the Pyramid thinking that might be cool for our Spy Ninjas fan daughter but it was not. The room hadn't been updated probably since the Luxor was first built and the smell of cigarette and weed smoke continuously seemed to cycle through the room. We even had one of those Stay Well rooms with the fancy air filtration system which could only keep up with filtering the smoke out of the air if it was cranked up to 11 (which made it annoyingly noisy). Then we switched rooms to the West Tower to a ""Premium"" room. I think they ""Premium"" designation was so-given because you pay a premium price for pretty much the same sh!t."
10,It was the worst possible hotel experience. Elevators where shaking while  Going up and down inside was boarded up. The hallways smelled. Lighting in the casino and hallways where poor. Stain furniture in hotel room stain towels at the pool just know we’re all terrible experience
30,I stayed in the 2 bedroom suite. The room was very nice. The pool area is huge and was always a good time.    But. The location is terrible. And the volume of tv's in the rooms only goes to 25 or 35. Thats really the only reason i wouldnt stay here again.
40,The shower drain didn't work so we had to wade in the water up to our ankles one of the shower doors was missing so the water was wetting the floor. There was no fridge or microwave in the room and pool closed extra early at 6pm.
10,No washcloths the entire stay. No housekeeping services at all even though I requested twice. Resort credit is really not a resort credit. Be ware it's not a great place if you want customer service..
50,Absolute top-notch experience with a Luxor everything was perfect from checking to check out. My casino host Scott Altman is an absolute rock star and made for an incredibly luxurious stay for me! I will be back!
10,Luxor was a joke at check in. Crappy front desk managers Russell in particular was no help to the point where he even shrugged his shoulders at my wife and myself . Room smelled like rotten eggs sewage. Plumbing backed up. It's a joke here
10,"Our stay was miserable. We stayed in a ""newly renovated room"" and OH BOY!    Our room was consistently 80+ degrees and having spoken with several other guests this was a common problem through the facility. The temperatures outside were hovering around triple digits for our entire stay and typically the hotel room especially for the price is supposed to act as a reprieve from the heat. This was not the case in fact it was hard to enjoy the trip due to the in-escapable heat. I understand Las Vegas is in the desert so some heat should be expected. However in the past year we've had 4 separate trips to MGM properties in the city including 4 nights in August and have never been this uncomfortable.    Along with the heat issue we had to step over garbage bags in the walkway to our rooms every time we left or returned. The WiFi that our resort fee was supposedly paying for was so bad that when we told an employee we were trying to connect via our mobile device they said ""Good Luck with that"" which is a terrible look for a property who is trying to promote a digital only room key.    There were other small inconveniences that we could have overlooked such as the shaky elevators poorly designed showers that were impossible to use without flooding the bathroom directions to our room that were unusable due to an elevator bay being out of service or the fact that we could only get two extra pillows for the room despite having registered 3 total guests in the room.    We come to Las Vegas 4-6 times per year and this was by far the absolute worst hotel visit we have had and it makes us rethink our decision to stay at any MGM property in the future."
30,The hotel was renovated but still in need of updating and maintenance. Stay was fine for the weekend but noticed dirty and chipped paint dirty light fixtures dirty patio and concrete leading to pool areas. For an MGM property thought that it would be maintained better. Staff was friendly and check in was easy with the MGM app and make your own room key kiosk.
40,Wether it’s your first trip out in Vegas or a repeat I highly recommend this resort. Staff is always super friendly helpful and ready to assist in any need. Casino staff is always making their rounds for service and drinks. Will return every time.
50,We went to las vegas Thursday morning thru Sunday with family Had an awesome 4 day stay for memorial weekend.we will be back in Aug again to celebrate my brother in law's birthday weekend we come at least once a month 🙌😀
20,Ac dident work in room  45 min wait for elevators  the line for the pool was bad had a cabana and waited for ever ! Kids kept pooping in pool maybe since Vegas is a family travel place now have a kid pool so the adults can swim
20,The staff is awesome especially on the casino floor and at the Fantasy show. The food is great. Too bad the rooms are terrible. Ac barely worked and no mini-fridge in the room. bed uncomfortable and the bathroiom was missing tiles. If not for the room this would have been 5 stars
50,Recently stood at the Luxor and the rooms and staff where very friendly and the rooms well maintained. Wish there was a Bluetooth speaker/alarm clock in the room but other then that the stay was good.
50,Loved my room! Great quality and was very comfortable. I strongly urge any traveler to sign up for the MLife rewards program. We got 30% off our room at the time of booking. The casino level is HUGE and the only gripe I had was the minimum amount of the bets. I've been here plenty of times and the bets were always $5. They boost the price up to like $10 or $15 when it's really busy but this time bets were like $20 - $25 lol. We still played and had fun though.
50,We were in the pool most of the time and had so much fun! Poolside service was perfect we were there pretty much all day. Updated pyramid rooms were real nice and clean. Staff is amazing very friendly and helpful as always.
10,Very poor quality  Beds hard sink cracked and did not drain shower very slow to drain base board coming unglued from wall carpet stained no chairs no closet towels small and poor quality  Parking atrocious. Dirty  Music very loud to point of distortion. Only caters to R&B/Hip Hop
10,This hotel and service was the worst stay ever! I stay at all the mgm resorts because of my MLife card and they have all be great! Except this stay at the Luxor! Took my wife and kids on this family vacation. I booked my room in advance through the MLife website. When we arrived for check in I stood in line for over an hour and a half to check in. I didn’t even make it all the way through. As i was waiting in line I decided to self check in through the mgm app. Which was pretty user friendly and cool. After I checked in through the App my room wasn’t ready until almost 4pm and that’s because I had to call the front desk. I was on hold with the front desk for an additional 45 minutes sitting in the parking lot with my wife and kids. Finally got through with someone who was able to accomodate a different room. Come to find after I recieved my room number that my room was damn near the size of 2 football fields from the elevator. So valet was closed we were forced to park in the structure in the back. So from the parking structure all the way across the bridge through the casino to the elevators to the 18th floor and 200 yards to our room! Every time we left or returned to our room that’s how far i had to walk with my wife and 3 kids. The elevator was scary as hell. It shook and made noise all the way up and down. The room was so outdated that our 32 inch television had no reception on any channels not to mention no movie channels. It was the worst experience ever! The couch in our room stunk like old stale cigarettes. Never ever again will i stay at this hotel nor reccomend anyone.
20,One hour to check in room smelled a LOT like cigarettes shower would get constantly flooded food at the pool was stupid expensive AND terrible. I would simply not stay here again. It was not a good stay.
40,I liked having a little refrigerator in the room. The staff was what you would expect from an MGM property (good).  The down sides were the slow draining shower and sink. There was also some construction that at times made it hard to work from the room.
40,Only thing I didn’t like is that they shut down parking in the front which was close to our room. Ask for a room close to the west side if not you’ll have to walk the garage tunnel casino floor  and through the lobby to get to your room.
50,Excellent stay no complaints what so ever. Beds are the most comfortable I have ever had at any motel. Staff were very attentive and helpful. Restaurants were very accommodating. Casino was kept very clean
10,Horrible AC in the first room moved to a second room and AC was still bad…. Although a bit better than the first still bad! Slept in the chairs in front of the AC just to try to stay somewhat cool. Saw multiple people arrested and removed from hotel which made me wonder how safe the hotel truly was. The resort fee is ridiculous when all we did was attempt to sleep in a hot room and that’s all. No mattress pad on the bed no coffee maker or Fridge in the room. Total waste of time and will be the absolute worst part of your visit!
50,Luxor was clean and great no issues. Wasn’t as busy as others like flamingo but crowd and atmosphere was ok they just need some more music like a live dj or something near the table games like New York New York to get the tempo up there.
50,Luxor is our favorite hotel because it is not too big but big enough. It is good location because it is near the monorail at MGM and also with in walking distance of other hotels like New York New York.
50,My fiancé and I had the absolute best time getting away from everything for a couple days and the Luxor was the perfect place to do so. The bed was the most comfortable of any resort I’ve been at and the pillows so good I researched and bought a couple for our house!!
20,I try to be objective in my observations so look up my comments in the first item of this survey - the airconditioner was spewing a rather humid kind of air there was no microwave provided in the suite etc. etc.
10,Wow does this place suck. Stay away. We were given a room in the engineering spaces of the hotel that was old shabby and run-down. It was miles away from everything. Just an awful experience and if I could get my money back I would.
50,It’s your chance to sleep on a pyramid or in one of the towers in one of the most iconic buildings in Vegas. The hotel is cool looking inside and out. The rooms are comfortable and you’ll sleep like a king or queen (see what I did there?)    Recommend to check in early if you can!
20,Upon check in staff was rushed to assist and unfriendly. Staff walked away from me to answer other guest questions. Felt check in process to be unorganized. Room had no toiletries towels and was dirty.
10,Dirty room m life key pass didn’t work couldn’t check in or out through malice app loud neighbors parking was horrible no valet parking self parking was a 10 minute walk then rode around at least an hour looking for parking
50,Can I shine some light on the unsung hero’s of Sunday after a pandemic or even still during a pandemic.A LGBTQ event for this Sunday funday Memorial Day weekend had some amazing staff members that just shined above and beyond. David as security was so accommodating and hospitable even when he didn’t have all the answers he made the effort to find out the answers.The influx’s of families and hotel guest Kyree kept it professional and friendly! Morgan Brielle and Deba are amazing. These women!!! Just everything in between. Great energyhard working friendly and just a great representation of hardworking.I acknowledge all there efforts and great energy. Or e  Server Niqi (Nikki) was juggling. She was everywhere doing the most for everyone and still kept the vibe and energy at 100%. So much thanks. The staff works hard and should be appreciated and as a patron and fellow hospitality worker these people are amazing and should be appreciated as so! Thank you for your hard work! I’ll be back❤️
30,We had 5 rooms in our group and they were drastically different. Elevators outdated and some out of service as well as walkways/escalators. Loved the pool Diablos was delicious (waitress was not friendly or attentive) Spa services and front staff were wonderful!
40,Good location clean nice restaurants & nice pools! Don’t have anything bad to say about it. Only gave 4 stars instead of 5 because the bell desk associate was really rude to me. I checked my bags until our flight left and she acted like I was interrupting her.
30,During COVID cleanliness is upmost importance when lacking shares your commitment to your customer well-being. Good location can’t reach customer service attentive staff at check-in. Great access to other casinos and things to do. Need to provide designated smoking areas.
40,1st time at the Luxor. Stayed in a 2 bedroom suite in the east tower. Furniture is a little dated but no complaints about the room condition etc. My only gripe was that the restaurants opened and closed at odd times and I’m assuming this is still based on the Covid issue. Otherwise it was a good stay.
50,We had a great time & were well taken care of by all staff we encountered!! We appreciated the self-check in as it was so much faster than the check-in line.  We did miss having our little coffee pot to have coffee while getting ready for our day out.
10,"Upon arriving at the Luxor you will be greeted by the pungent smell of urine heated in the Vegas sun as you cross from self park to the casino. Then you will encounter a maze of slot machines as you are guided be confusing signs to your hotel elevator. All the while inhaling cigarette and marijuana smoke. Once you get to your floor you will notice someone's drink glass that will still be there 16 hours later when you check out.    In your room you will probably notice there is no hair dryer. When you call the front desk about getting a hair dryer you will be told by the woman at the front desk that ""she does not have time for this"" and hangs up on you.    Guest hospitality and cleanliness are not priorities at this resort. If you are looking for a moderately prices MGM resort that is cleaner and with better service I would recommend the Park MGM."
50,The hotel is absolutely beautiful inside and out. The decor is fun. The rooms are clean comfortable. The staff was nice and helpful when needed. The pool is gorgeous and big There are outside bars as well.
30,Better rooms off strip than what you could get there pools closed at 6 so much for doing anything on the strip and coming back for a dip and then gettting dressed and out for the evening hell the restaurant closed early too. No coffee maker in room so had to walk a mile every morning instead of just relaxing
40,Rooms look and feel dated with ours having a water leak in the corner of the carpet making the whole room feel alittle damp. Check in takes to long 45 + minutes depending on when you arrive. Staff was very friendly especially the bell desk staff Price was when we booked was great.
30,Booked a Premium King room 5 mos in advance. Checked in and the sink spurted water up from the drain. Was moved to a Queen room and not offered any sort of refund. When asked was told no. Placed in a new room furthest from a working elevator. Was our first vacation since the start of the pandemic and we were very disappointed with our visit this time around.
10,Stains on the furniture ....use your imagination....yellow stains on the ceiling....dingy and cramped....overpriced....needs major renovation....unsatisfactory service fulfillment....unacceptable hotel that should be closed down by the Las Vegas Health Department
10,"I had actually thought about staying at the Luxor ever since it was built lo those many years ago. Finally I had an opportunity with a price breakdown that brought the total including the high resort fee to just under $60/night net so I booked for 3 days. And it had to be the pyramid.    On day 2 at 8:30 p.m. or so after coming back from going around town I opened the door only to instantly discover that a charging tablet my carry-on size backpack and a tote bag with stuff in it had been taken from the room even as the room had been made up. I looked everywhere in the room but it was gone.    The tablet was worth about $60 a ClipSport (like an ipod) around $40 and also a camera maybe $150-200 all told including the swim trunks and sandals in the bag. Not a huge score for the thief and a pawn shop might laugh at the stuff but super annoying. It was either: a) housekeeping staff or b) (more likely) someone who got in because the door hadn't been pulled all the way to.    With carpeted floors and the door alignments you really have to pull hard on the door to get it to latch. If you don't pull hard enough or leave it to close by itself it'll look closed but just a gentle push is all it takes to open. I could see the latching problem and pulled it hard that morning but if someone else was in the room like housekeeping I can't control whether they did or not.    The thief was probably in the room for just a few seconds and took only what looked most promising which leads me to believe it might not have been housekeeping but someone who knew about that vulnerability. In 30 years of travel in 52 countries and all 50 states I'd never had any room theft like that happen 'til then.    I reported to security and they took down the laundry list of items missing and one person offered me a $25 food voucher but that's the extent of it so far. I'm sure the management will point out the rooms have safes though the backpack won't fit and most people aren't used to having to store sandals or swim trunks in one. They really need to look at and fix the security vulnerability.    To put a cherry on the sundae at around 1:15 a.m. that night someone pulled a fire alarm which brings a continuous loop with the alarm noise and the same ""announcement"" over and over for 20 minutes or so in this case. It affected the whole pyramid and most people just went out on the inside catwalk overlooking the atrium.    Being trunk-less I didn't get to try the pool but quite a few people were around there. From other reviews I'd been concerned about the elevators. Thankfully I never had to wait more than one car's worth of people in front of me but I don't know what the percentage occupancy was those days (they were weekdays). So YMMV and it may devolve to longer lines if the place is full. The elevator banks serve different groups of floors so if yours is say 6-15 you're best off being on the 15th floor so as not to see full cars going down.    Overall it wasn't the best of visits...I'll probably go back to the Longhorn or Mardi Gras at maybe 50-60% the all-in cost."
40,You need to fix the air conditioning in the room it is a chiller air conditioning or a water heat pump it only feel like a 5 degrees different from return to supply causing the room to feel really stuffy.
40,We've been staying here since it first opened at least 25 years ago. Starting to see it go in the right direction.    The app continues to be a pain but it is starting to work. It took a couple of hours to get the app to check me in. Once I got it figured out it worked really well the rest of our stay.
10,Where to start....? When we checked in the mobile check in wasn't user friendly however the check in line moved relatively quick. once we got our room information it took us 15-20+ minutes to get an elevator in the Pyramid because the have construction going on and they have guests diverted to elevators 4A & B at one point it took us about 30 minutes to get an elevator. We got move to the east tower and the seemed to remedy the elevator issues however the smell of marijuana is so pungent it made us actually ill. We had a wake up call scheduled and the smell of marijuana was so strong that it woke us up and we were nauseated and we couldn't sleep and we have medical conditions that require machines and the smell was getting into our machines. Look I get it you want to smoke that crap however have some respect for others not everyone enjoys that smell. The hotel has a no smoking in the room policy but since they go on the honor policy it goes to show that people have no honor.
10,From check in to check out I was treated less than guest. My check in took 6 hrs which cost me a Vegas day and at check out they wanted to charge me for something I did not owe. Choose other hotels.
40,The room I saw on the website when I booked was totally different from the room given. There are few Lyft/Uber drivers so you will wait over 10 mins most of the time. Good place to sleep if you don’t have plans on being there all day.
10,Do not stay here if you want bad customer service after being stuck in the elevator for 10-15 minutes. We were only offered free resort fee. Manager wanted to charge us more to move us to a different tower. The shower doesn’t have a door so the whole bathroom gets flooded with water. Early morning they have constructions going on.
50,I have been staying at Luxor for about 10 years and fly to Vegas 3 or 4 times a year. I have never had any problems with my stays. Staff is always professional helpful and courteous. Good location casino floor and restaurants. May look and feel a little dated but I have alot of great memories here and will always stay at the Luxor.
10,No coffee pots no shower doors pool area smelt like sewage elevator leaves your imagination. Garbage left on carts. The walk alone just to get to the elevator was literally the farthest away from our room. Took the stairs and it looked like a bad horror flick.
40,Overall this is a good place to stay. Only problems we had was the lack of pillows and towels. We booked a double Queen room and there wasn’t enough provided for the 4 people we had. Along with the AC it didn’t keep the room cold and the room felt muggy not sure if it’s cause it’s hot outside but the room didn’t feel refreshing.
10,My room was right next to an elevator that went out of service. We had to walk to the other side of the pyramid every time came or went from our room. The water in our room was not working at check-in due to construction. None of this was told to us at check-in.
10,Never going back to this place again. Been coming since I was a young boy and not only is the magic gone the hotel is falling apart. Water went out on several floors affecting several families with us and some rooms flooded when they came back on.    My elderly mother got food poisoning at the cafe and couldn’t fly home. They charged us another $700 to extend an extra night for a single room despite needing to call medics to the room.    Just awful place and awful people.
10,Very bad will not stay there again to many issues. And not enough rules in place to soical distancing. And hotel staff could be more understanding and helpful and actually in help when u need it. And the food places close to early have to go elsewhere to get food.
30,The room was definitely in need refreshing. The room I was in had peeling wallpaper and cracks in the tiles in the bathroom. My room did not have a view. The room just definitely needed some updating and maintenance. But staff was nice and helpful.
30,Room was supposed to be upgraded wasn't housekeeping came in without approval and with do not disturb sign loud and was continually woken up I don't know what else to write considering I'm done explaining and it has to be 200 characters
50,Although not the biggest or newest hotel/casino on the strip we always come back to the Luxor. Very happy with rooms casino pool and service. It would be nice if they went smoke free like the Park MGM.
50,Clean Rooms Comfortable beds Fun Theme It is on the end of the strip so you will need to walk or taxi to get to the middle. Great value when it comes to price vs comfort and amenities. I’ve stayed here twice and both trips were great at this location
50,Awesome service! The room was clean. The hotel was fun. From check in to check out everyone was friendly. The casino was sanitized. Our room was spacious. No odors of cigarettes. Overall the weekend was relaxing.
10,Disgusting room with dirt ant puke all over the room. This was the worst experience of my life at a hotel room I will be telling everyone I know about how the Luxor is completely in bad hands. You guys ruined this hotel
20,If your not a high roller They don't care about there guests... If you have issues takes to long for them to try to resolve them.. If you need a scooter I suggest you try a company off the strip and pay the delivery fee...
50,Had an amazing trip! Would definitely stay at the Luxor again. All the staff was so friendly and the pool and room was super clean. Anytime we my family needed anything it was brought to us very quickly. Had a wonderful maskless experience. A+++
40,During May 2021 I used four comps for stays (in the order of best first) at Mandalay Bay (big room nice) Mirage (very nice) Park MGM (nice room but not as upscale) and Luxor (curious design but a bit dated). Luxor room was fine two very comfortable chairs desk no minibar or refrig and suitable bathroom. In general the hotel just feels a bit tired. The air conditioner did not work so I had to be moved to another room. The first room also had a stale tobacco smell. The second room was much better and the staff was very helpful. Bottom line... the location is good and if you can snag a good rate go for it. My wife and I usually stay at Vdara which is certainly nice. But if the rates at any of the four I stayed in are substantially lower there is no need to pay so much more at Vdara Bellagio Aria etc. Spend the money on dining out and shows not the room. We have never had a meal in the hotels; there are plenty of other places to dine... like In and Out !!
30,I been coming to the Luxor since 2006. I love it here. This time wasn’t my most memorable. My closest elevator was not working and had a long walk. Seems they are upgrading and maybe my next experience will be better.
40,My room appeared to have been updated (at least from the last time I stayed) recently. Very clean comfortable beds.    Great location if you will be hiking close to I15 and 215 loop so it's easy to get to Red Rock Canyon State Park and Sloan Canyon (to see the petroglyphs). Easy access to I15 makes travel to Valley of Fire easy as well.    There is a Whole Foods and Total Wine just south of the hotel to pick up some in-room snacks and libations.    The tram & walking sidewalks (when operating) make it easy to get from Mandalay Bay to NYNY.
40,This was the 2nd time my wife and I have visited Vegas in the past year and both times we stayed at Luxor. It's a beautiful hotel and we're happy with renovated room except shower situation. We will definitely stay again though.
10,I arrived to my stay upgraded my room as my original room wasn’t done which was fine! i paid 200$ and went on to enjoy my trip! The night before check out as i was cleaning my room my friend and i found a voodoo doll hidden under our bed along with clothes that weren’t ours that were there since our arrival which my friend and i mistook for each other’s. when i called the hotel to refund me for the update i was told they could only give me a portion of my money back because they’re trying to be “fair to other guests” but what about us? i don’t believe a partial refund is “fair” for a dirty room with a voodoo doll hidden in it. The first representative wouldn’t even repeat the word voodoo out of fear and uncomfortability but i am  supposed to accept a partial refund? I would NEVER recommend the Luxor to anyone. I’d rather recommend Motel 6 or Super 8 than this establishment.
10,I will never ever ever ever ever ever ever stay at the Luxor . First they don’t tell you about how expensive their incidental is($50 a day). No refrigerator no microwave in the rooms;not enough elevators& the ones they do have not all of them work! One thing for sure is you’ll get your steps in. You have to walk a country mile to Ge to your room in unless you’re lucky enough to be by the elevator.I hate writing bad reviews but this really ticked me off. P.S. make
30,Hotel was good  staff was helpful except the room view was nonexistent during booking I was told a strip view  Luxor doesn’t have strip views .. Pool was nice  casino was good  table minimums were high  restaurants were good
30,Staff was amazing the casino was great and overall the main area was awesome.    The room not so much. Bathroom door was messed up there was no shower door the room had a very moist feel to it. It might have just been our room bc we did go to another friends room and it was the opposite. But on his side we waited for an elevator for almost 20 min
40,Set of the Luxor from May 20 to the 25th staff was amazing and above and beyond Rooms were good for the value A little far to walk to the strip and the only bump I came across was the water being turned off at 5am to 10am due to a flood on the 10th floor
20,When I checked into my room I realized the room had half of a shower door the elevators was all being worked on but one and it sounded like it was going to fall apart the toilet kept flushing the whole time of my stay the room had no refrigerator and the front desk said they was going to bring it and never did . The front desk people were rude just because I had a issue with my room they seemed mad.
50,Our recent LV visit brought us to Luxor for our stay. The entire experience was seamless and left us with extra time not having to spend time on checking in/out. The deli was also great to have available for a late night meal.
10,Rooms are crap  And come with a lot of issues we stayed 5 days and in that time we’re moved to 3 different rooms all had issues we had to deal with. Rooms smell like hell from all the smoke in the casino and most employees didn’t give a funk about you or helping you find your way around.
20,Elevators are sketchy and dirty and the rooms are not worth the price all the furniture in my room was chipped looked like they got it from a swap meet and housekeeping is rude and disrespectful . I would advise friends to maybe book somewhere else on the strip for the kind of money you will be spending
40,Some restaurants were still closed. No buffet yet... bummer. Hotel was lively lots of interesting people there. Still plenty of space and slots were friendly! All the bars were not open for some reason. Hotel stores had everything you could want or need at a price. Had a lot of fun.
50,Great hotel to stay at . Was really close to strip. Checking in was easy and fast . Staff was very helpful when needed. Will be sure to recommend Luxor to my friends and family . Pools were clean and relaxing
10,Hotel is outdated they tel you that you will get renovated room and they don’t. So water is out for 3 hours don’t find that out until you get in the room. Maids don’t collect garbage not enough towels. And shower floods because they don’t have door...
50,My family and I stayed at the Luxor for my daughter’s birthday. While the Luxor is not the newest property on the Strip it is so unique and that uniqueness makes it such a fun adventure. You cannot beat the design of the hotel. We stayed in a suite with a large tub right under one of the windows. It was beautiful and so relaxing. We did have a small issue but a quick call down to the front desk resolved it quickly. The staff were all so nice the second day of our stay we enjoyed a cabana at the pool. They were very affordable for everything you got with the cabana and we were in a perfect location to be able to relax and people watch.  I am excited to return now that everything is opening back up and enjoy even more of what the property has to offer.
20,The room was in poor condition and the air conditioner did not work properly. Would appreciate a call from an executive. Maintenance could not repair the air and a request for a different room as denied. Paid too much for this experience.
30,This stay had many issues but the worked really hard to resolve them. I would only go back if no other options. Hotel front desk had old grouchy women who do not understand paying customer service. The hotel room I had to switch twice because of cleanliness.
20,I live in Los Angeles and Vegas is only 3.5 hours away from me so I go approximately 4/5 times a year. I've stayed at Tropicana MGM New York New York Park MGM Bellagio Caesars Palace Planet Hollywood Flamingo Linq Ballys Venetian Mirage Treasure Island Circus Circus I think Harrahs and twice at Luxor. Both stays at luxor were bad! and why did I come back a second time well because they updated their rooms. But man does this property fall short.    When we checked in we took elevator 2B to our room. Scariest elevator ride ever! The elevator from the inside is made out of plywood. See pictures for details. It shook so much and at check out this elevator was actually closed so something was obviously wrong with it.    As we walk in we noticed the the sink has stale water. We called to get the sink unclogged and no one showed up. We called back 3 hours after and finally their engineer showed up. Great guy by the way. So we go to elevator 2B to take the elevator. We are waiting for approximately 15 minutes and the elevators are not coming. So we asked a housekeeper if shes aware of any issues with the elevator and she says no. Not her fault but we go back and wait 5 more minutes. We get tired of waiting and we decide to walk to the other elevator which is diagonally. ITS A FAR WALK! its definitely a 10 minute walk to walk from one elevator to the other elevator (see pictures of hall way). The reasons this gets me upset is because we left with good timing to our restaurant reservation and now we have to call our reservation that we wont be making it on time even with their 10 minute grace period.    We take the elevator and their engineer is riding with us and a couple of guest. People complaint to the engineer and he states the other option is to walk down the stairs. We are on the 13th floor! and he also says that the stairs are known as the dungeons lol.    In addition to this the room quality is just crap. Their carpet still has tile underneath. The nails to hold the carpet are sticking out near the AC. This is not a room upgrade/update. This is lipstick on a pig. Even worst I asked their phone agent to note my account because I would be complaining no one has contacted us about our stay after submitting our review through them directly. I would consider the LUXOR and the Flamingo as the worst properties on the strip.
40,The Luxor was clean. Being a female solo traveler I felt safe. The initial checking in with the app was a little difficult but that is MGM and the app not any hotels directly.    The staff was friendly answered any questions I had accurately and with a great attitude I never felt like I was bothering them. Housekeeping staff was excellent. I was able to get what I needed in terms of towels glasses etc.. with no problem and promptly.    My 2 complaints were with resort fees and limited access to resort amenities due to Covid-19 limitations the rooms could have been upgraded a little. There are no refrigerators but my biggest complaint was no coffee makers. It was only in the mid 60s during the night and probably 40-50s at night all eating places closed by 11pm a cup of coffee would have been nice!
50,It was a really lovely hotel. It wasn't overcrowded it had great food and it was very clean! My partner and I were very pleased with the cleanliness and comfort of the room as well!! We will definitely be returning for any future trips to Las Vegas!!!
30,The hotel was really cool but they only had one place on each floor for the elevators they were very far from where our room was. A lot of walking just to get to the elevator. Our room could have been cleaner. Overall the hotel was really different and was ok for the time we were there.
20,Overall okay. Beds are not great. The usual coronavirus closures. Hardly any place to eat. But the smell of POT!!! Overwhelming in hallways and elevators. Smells like a frat house. Valet is also not running right now so beware if you are disabled.
20,Upgraded 2 rooms to get a 2 bedroom suite. Thought I would splurge I can't believe I paid an extra $125 a nite for 3 nites on having almost the exact same thing! I had a single suite with a connecting door to a regular king bedroom.
30,Great value at the south of the strip. Staff was exceptional. Rooms are in definite need of remodeling. Elevators have plywood in them. No refrigerator in room. Room smelled like weed and cigarette smoke.
20,The constant beeping of the unloading trucks starting at 6am was a real problem. The hotel was not clean. I expect more from a casino that makes millions daily. I will never stay here again. I would not recommend this place at all.
40,Newly decorated rooms. Super friendly staff. Great location. Easy mobile check in with digital keys. Reasonable price. Took off a few points for minor things. Overall a great hotel. Would stay here again.
50,I was greeted at the door and immediately assisted with trying to check in early with success. My room was clean comfortable and I had a great view of the mountains hidden behind the clouds. Every worker I encountered was pleasant and helpful and housekeeping was prompt when I asked for extra blankets. I would definitely recommend staying and I'll be back.
50,We were able to get connecting rooms which was great for our group. Check in line took a while but the lady that checked us in was very helpful. Pool was great and the bar at the pool had excellent drinks. Would stay here again.
20,My wife and I made this reservation for our 18th year anniversary. I will not stay here again. The room was very poor quality for just being renovated. There was no refrigerator in the room and it was not very clean. No fans in the bathrooms and just felt dirty.
50,I really enjoyed my stay here. We stayed the week before Nevada lifted all covid restrictions but my husband and I were fully vaccinated so we got to enjoy many of the amenities. There was no room service except for in room dining provided by Pyramid Cafe. Which is really good! There are timeshare schemes at almost every entrance to and from the hotel so be aware. They’ll stop you at every chance. Overall my experience was super. Even saw Fantasy at the Luxor theater! The girls are extremely talented and easy to look at ;)
50,The night was peaceful and I enjoy the whole experience. the price again was very reasonable as it save us a lot of money considering we missed our flight. Overall the room was clean and and we were happy to have had a clean room to rest.
10,There are much better places to stay on the strip for the same money. The rooms are extremely dated. The TV has very poor quality broadcasting. The drawers in my dresser in the room would not stay shut.
30,I requested a lower level room close to the elevator due to health issues and this just didn’t happen. I went to the front desk and told them my requests when making the reservation and what did they do? They put in a room further from the Casino and restaurants as possible. Had no energy to speak up just accepted it.
10,Staff were not friendly. Waited in hold 4 hours on 3 different times just to change reservation. Then was told I had to pay $100 more. Checked in and the walls were peeling and room full of dusk. Had to purchase several of the $7each sinus pills. Spoke to staff and I was told we are short staff it’s out of our control due to Covid. Then was told someone will get back with me and never did.
40,I finally got to the Luxor for my visit. I met a wonderful couple to hang out with during my stay. We gambled ate dranked and travel the area while there. A new friendship was formed while waiting for an Uber at the airport that didn't come.
40,I am so pleased that Las Vegas is staring to open its doors and the Luxor is right in step. I know it will take some time to create all the guidelines and make the proper once again a well honed place to have fun gamble eat and be entertained with all the possibilities offers at this time. Cheers to all!
10,I would not stay here again the rooms are run down carpet had huge stains and felt crunchy to walk on. The Luxor smelled like Marijuana inside the casino and in the rooms. Outside area was dirty. The slot machines were dirty.
50,Beautiful room at the Luxor Hotel in Las Vegas. Pyramid King Room. Also alot of different restaurants as well. I know that I will enjoy my stay and will bring my family next time. Way to go Luxor you did not disappoint
50,Had a great stay at the Luxor. Check-in/check-out was super easy and convenient to do from my phone. I also love the digital key feature within the MGM app. The room was clean and met all my needs. Overall great stay!!
50,This was my first time staying at this hotel and I must say I love it and can’t wait to come back. The rooms were spacious and clean the staff was amazing from check in to check out. I most definitely will be back.
40,Everything at Luxor was great...but you WILL get your steps in! I've stayed here many times and each stay has been very good. Machines are tight but they do have a large variety maybe I just picked the wrong ones!
10,Elevator buttons and digital key shock you every time. Room reeked of cigarette smoke. Opened items left in the mini bar e.g. open gallon of milk. Wi-Fi signal was weak to the point that it was almost useless.
10,Rundown and severely over priced. Half the tables are closed and not all the table games are even offered. The adjoining MGM hotels are just as bad and understaffed. Sucks to walk 2 miles from your room to the tables to find them mostly closed.
10,Room smelled bad no one helped me get another room I called the front desk and they said they would get me another room and it never happened. Very disappointed and not satisfied. They didn’t refund me
50,Wonderful pool and great amenities cant beat the las Vegas heat in a better way than at the Luxor Oasis pool just cant wait to see the spa open again. With food and Starbucks only a few feet away how could you go wrong? Oh and taco Tuesday at the cantons!
10,Pre check in doesn't work.  Overflowing shower.  No cold water in sink.  Elevators broken.  Missing bar staff.  No answer at from desk for days.  No refrigerator.  Pool cabana canceled on us the night before.  Alarm went off all morning.  Chipping hammers going off at 0900
40,A lot of negative reviews and I’m not sure exactly why. My flight was delayed and I arrived after midnight but thanks to mobile check-in and a digital smart key getting my room was a breeze even in the middle of the night.    The room was in the East Tower and was spacious modern clean and comfortable. A step in shower and a separate tub and housekeeping was there each and every day of my stay so cleanliness was not an issue. The bed was plush and comfortable and I had a work desk and separate lounge area where I could work remotely.    The lack of a micro fridge and coffee maker is odd for any hotel in 2021 but there are plenty of options for food and drink so there was no real issues beyond convenience of staying in room for a quick drink.    Location is far enough away from the center of the strip to keep the undesirable riff raff away but close enough that you can easily walk to the heart of the strip in about 25-30 mins assuming you like riff raff.    Additionally it’s connected to the beautiful Mandalay Bay and very serviceable Excalibur so there are multiple casinos Sportsbooks bars entertainment and dining options to choose from all while staying nice and comfortable in the A/C.    A nice stay and I was pleasantly surprised!!
40,Great vibe nice people good location. I’d definitely go back. Check in was easy and the room was nice (East Tower). It was close enough to enjoy all the strip activities but not directly on the main part of the strip
40,My remodeled room was very nice. Don’t mind the construction on floors at certain times. The elevators had wood all around inside of them to protect them from being ruined by construction equipment. Don’t pay attention to it. My room was clean and neat. There are great people to talk to and be friendly with all over the hotel.
40,Great place wonderful stay helped with my disable parents getting around was wonderful thank you. My dad is battling cancer is he was wanting to go and he was happy Thank you so much for making it great experience we will be back.!
40,Our stay was awesome. Very clean rooms and quiet hallways. The front desk staff eas very friendly and patient when we were lost walking around the hotel. The location is great I think the food court offering should improve but in general everything was great.
50,Great place to stay  the building is just as amazing outside as it is inside. The only thing for hotel stay is the elevator wait . The casino has so many slots ! Great food restaurants too . So much at one place we didn’t even leave to the strip !
10,We checked in and were automatically downgraded without telling us. After waiting an hour in hold hung up on transferred 5 times and hung up on again we were forced to go to the lobby vip to fix things. When we were created by the lobby vip tendent she was rude so we were being rude back she contacted the manager and told a ridiculous lie and said we were racist to her! I’m Mexican how am I racist! The manager put us on a finally warning and laughed in our face. We went for my sister-in-laws 21 birthday and that gave her the worst experience ever. We will never stay at the Luxor or m life hotels again. No discount or refund applied.
40,Stayed in a newly renovated room which was very nice. Upgraded furnishings lots of charging options and hubs for electronics. Bathroom shower head was amazing. Hotel has opted to limit pillows and towels and it is a challenge getting extras due to limited staff availability.
40,Arrived on the 16th. Dennis (Denis?) at the mlife Front Desk was so GREAT. Friendly and so nice. Loved that masks weren’t required for fully vaccinated guests. Bars were not staffed which was odd but given the time we are in I guess expected? Staff nice! Pool great but understaffed. Not all the pools were opened at the same time due to lack of lifeguards . Cocktail servers GREAT. Diablo’s was always a favorite but the portion size and selections were questionable compared to 2019. Good time! We love the Luxor!
10,Booked 2 Rooms 1 had NO towels and the other had 1 towel AND a broken toilet that we called to get fixed. It wasn't properly fixed. We called and were told we had to WALK down because they couldn't help us over phone. My bother in law stood in line over 40 minutes to be told the best they could do was split our group and give us a smaller room. AT THE SAME PRICE! I was not okay with this. I called again and this time I was told to go back down but to stand in the VIP line for faster service. I still waiting a good 20 minutes. I explained my entire situation and the lady told me should could move our entire group so that we would get everything just like it should be. I asked her to confirm that the room style and size were the same and the rooms were adjoining rooms. She confirmed. By now we had missed our lunch reservations and went back up to pack up and move. We got to the new rooms only to find out it WASN'T the same as before. The rooms were not adjoining like she said. I was too upset and tired to go back in line a third time. NEVER AGAIN!
30,Hotel run down. Carpet bathrooms are in need of deep clean. Tile by elevators cracked and loose causing hazard to guests. No bath towels and when I called to request they only brought us hand towels.
50,My family and I had a great time staying here. We are hoping to see the buffet open soon. I’m sure lots of other people are waiting for that too. I’m happy to see new slot machines and also some of our favorite old machines!
40,Great location at the striphotel rooms are alright ac didn’t work well and shower drained was clogged. Casino floor is pretty simple layout. Food court is minimal could use more options. Buffet is still close till further notice. Casino is pretty clean.
50,Our room was clean comfortable and nicely renovated. We always have a great time at luxor and love the Egyptian theme. There options for food are great and the pool is beautiful. Definitely recommend The Luxor. Especially the pyramid rooms.
10,Terrible customer service No response from my request Concierge service was the worst I've ever experienced. Long wait Time for phone service and check in. Elevator got stuck while I was in it overall property seemed to be run down and falling apart.
30,The room had issues with the shower loud bangs through the night. Elevators are a bit scary. This was one of my favorite places to stay years ago. The staff was great but quality of rooms has declined!
20,Cleaning lady walked in while I was sleeping. No in-room lock on doors so house keeping or any one with acess can just come in without knowledge. Not a good feeling knowing someone can just come in the room while your sleeping or in the shower.
50,I love the features of this property the pyramid theme was really cool. The location is not the greatest but it wasn't difficult to get to the strip and walk all over the place for us. The room was nice and comfortable only downside was the floor was a little bit dirty. Bed was very comfortable. Overall would stay again.
20,Room furniture needs updating our two ac units in room were not cooling properly. Had to wait a long time for elevators too come down to main floor. Elevators felt like they were about to breakdown when using
40,Wish rooms had mini fridge and microwave. Nice to have a little water to keep in room and a place to save leftover over food we had from great restaurants. Room service would be welcome as well. Room was not a clean as I would prefer.
10,half the room was good and half the room was unsafe. the shower was an accident waiting to happen because it overflowed and the design is terrible with a half door. this is a law suit waiting to happen. I left a day early and went to another hotel.
20,Expected the room be alot more clean and nice than what we walked into. Plus there were dirty rags left on the bathroom sink as well. Felt like they did a quick sweep of the room for big messes but were not very detailed oriented in cleaning the small things.
40,This was a business trip with the seminar also held at the Luxor. I had only been in the property once before. The room and staff were very friendly and helpful. Thank you! I did not have an incredible large amount of time for really relaxing. The gaming was probably the largest negative. Once while I was there did my game (baccarat) table open up and it was my last night and only one table.
20,"Off to a great start with early mobile check-in and a cool digital key that meant we could skip the lines but the experience went downhill from there. The walk to the West Wing which sounds fancier and way more political than it was was so long that I really had to pee when I got to the room. I tried to open the door with the digital key but no WiFi so no luck getting in! I was trying desperately get it to work so I could get to the restroom in time so asked my 16-year old to PLEASE try using her phone since I had texted her the stupid key but she was Snap Chatting something very important so put in very little effort and said “stop yelling… I tried” to which I shouted ""try harder!"" Not my best mom moment but I was desperate and as I was losing the battle with my bladder the key finally worked. After tending to the emergency I was able to check out our accommodations. The room was grimy and dated there was something unknown and crusty dried into the carpet next to the bed and the pillows were lumpy from years of use. I seriously don't think this place has been updated since King Tut stayed there.    Tried the WiFi again to no avail and my daughter said “maybe it’s part of the experience and supposed to make you feel like you’re in ancient Egypt?” Haha. Took 10 minutes and several call attempts to reach the front desk and ask for a room with a better signal to be told that there is no floor where WiFi works well and most days she can’t even get a signal on her phone. She also mentioned they were sold out which I found shocking.    After a passable night’s sleep woke up to noises that sounded like my neighbor abusing his wife only to realize that I was hearing them have kinky sex through the paper-thin walls. I was so happy my daughter was still asleep! Unfortunately they went for round 2 that night and my daughter was awake so we sat in awkward silence until they were done… thankfully our horny neighbors were quick. I almost wanted to wait for the sound of them leaving their room so I could meet them in the hall and shout “two times in one day… good job!” and high five them.    The only thing going for this hotel is that it’s walking distance to nicer hotels with better restaurants."
30,Don’t stay on a low floor and you’ll be good. The older rooms are very dated. Some of the lights didn’t work. Once we were upgraded to the 14th floor it was very nice. Some elevators didn’t work which resulted in long lines to get to rooms and they don’t let you use the stairs.
10,"could not wait to leave will never visit this dive ever again.  Short on Towels 1 Pillow on the Bed $300/night complete Ghetto.  This trip was the worst experience one could have experienced in Vegas the Casino smelled like crap I have no problem with smokers but I didn't see anyone smoking but the entire Casino everywhere you went stunk like crap my eyes watered would NOT recommend bringing kids to this place. it was a jungle and this was the ""Slow Period"" employees exhibited it's a job mentality did NOT even come close to my expectations. every elevator is Tagged w/ etched mumbo jumbo pretty crappy for a ""World Class"" dis-organization stay if you must but you have been warned .."
50,You can’t go wrong with Luxor the property is clean the rooms are nice and the options are solid. It’s positioned nicely between Mandalay Bay and Excalibur so you’re good options pretty much double as well as gaming options.
20,We had poor service because the hotel was not staffed correctly  More staff needed to especially help out with reservations and I shouldn’t have had to spend a whole day trying to get two pillows    I didn’t get my pillow until 2:15 am
30,We really enjoyed r stay for the most part! Had strong winds that made for two really loud/bad nights of sleeping- Windows whistle like crazy- my wife and I both got sick from the food at Diablo’s cantina- shops/pool/food court experience was waaaay to expensive and overcrowded- but really besides that it was a cool trip and would do it again.
10,1. Upon check-in to our room we found dirty cleaning rags in the bathroom towel service not in the room no coffee service even though there was a coffee maker. I reported this to the front desk however it was not corrected.    2. The next morning we discovered the room was infested with small red ants. I reported this to the front desk and they moved my room. The new room had no towels no coffee service no toilet paper and the sink was stopped up. After reporting this to the front desk they brought us coffee and towels except the coffee did not work in the new coffee makers in the hotel and they took two tries and still did not get the towels right. They came to unclog the sink while I was in the shower and we had to turn the engineer away to return later. The sink drains better but still backs up with more than 2 cups of liquid are put in the sink.    3. There was some sort of maintenance/construction going on above our room where a hammer drill was almost constantly going from around 9:30am until 5:00pm.    4. The hotel food venues were severely limited and finding dining options made it necessary to leave the Luxor for other food venues.    5. The ice bucket in the second room had either dried food debris or dried vomit in the bottom of it.    6. Seven of the eight moving walkways in the Luxor and going to the Excalibur were not functioning during our entire stay.
30,Clean comfortable surprisingly quiet room. Check in process was a little confusing being all digital. Walk from parking structure to room was insanely long. Went to eat dinner when getting there and our first two choices of restaurants in the casino closed over an hour earlier than posted closing times. Anyhow it was overall a decent place not sure that I was particularly impressed though probably would stay somewhere else next time.
30,While the Luxor is old and in the process of remodeling the rooms you would think they would spend some money on repairing the A/C system. In both the entire hotel and in the rooms! They also did not have refrigerators or microwaves in the rooms. No option for a microwave but we did have to pay an additional $25 to have a refrigerator brought to our room.    However the bed was very comfortable!!
10,First time here with my family and will definitely be the last. Numerous problems with the hotel. Room was extremely hot. Knob to control a/c was broke off and missing. Loud construction noises all day everyday like someone was drilling through the floor. Alarm went off and we had to frantically exit with no explanation as to why.
10,if anyone is reading this seriously you wait 3-4 hours to check-in no fridge in your room. The AC's are from back when Elvis used to play smh it just sucks here unless maybe if your paying for the suite room way at the top where all the cigarette smoke goes lol but anyway the standard and deluxe queen rooms suck! hot and sticky and no ice machines ever work. Our toilet ran all over the floor but we already switched rooms twice plus waited 3+ hours to check in smh never again!
40,First time at luxor. It was nice being away from the middle of strip which seams to becoming very seedy. The casino was clean. Wish more of the shots were open but this is forgiven due to lack of employees due to covid. I do wish they had the vip lines at resturaunts and shops like ceasars property has.
10,Shower didn’t drain so you had to stand in dirty water with lord knows what in it. There was what looked like spit in cups left in room. Zero towels on check in and getting any was like asking for a no interest loan. Hallways dirty. Save your money and sleep on a bench. Too bad because it used to be a fun place.
30,Overall the hotel itself is nice in my opinion. However I did feel the daily resort fee's were very expensive considering some things were not open or closed very early. The wait for breakfast at the Pyramid even during the week was over an hour. Housekeeping came into our room while we had the do not disturb up while I was in the room. She acted very shady when she came through the door and as I was meeting her at the door. I told her we didn't need anything but she was still wanting to push her way into the room and then said she needed to use our phone. She just dialed a number and hung up...I found the whole experience very shady.    Getting a taxi to and from the airport or anywhere was very easy.    I would stay again for the right price but would try to work my way down to center strip.
10,It was really tough to navigate. There was no parking within a reasonable distance from rooms. The valet was also shut down and nobody was available to help with luggage. That’s really tough on you. Your wiped our before you even make it to the room.
10,When we checked in the woman helping us was rude the whole time. Then they gave our room we booked a month ago away and have us a smaller room. It was my birthday weekend and I just had horrible service all around from check in to having dinner and Public House and the casino. Will not be staying here again !
50,Friendly staff and accommodating and I hope the comment on the review here is not long and have a minimum character requirement . This is the only negative comment here. Because I enjoy my stay but I dont want to write a novel. T
40,My stay at the Luxor was ranked at a 6 out of 10. The reason for this ranking is my room was dated also the electronic key worked sometimes. Checking in through the app was easy to do and most efficient. The bars at the Luxor or great. They had good food and Hardy drinks. I can say that I stayed at the pyramid.
30,I certainly understand the Covid issue and that things are a little delayed. But the hotel is in need of serious refreshing. We stayed in the East Tower and I can’t believe how uncomfortable the stay was. I also can’t believe that every time I walked through the hallways all I could smell was marijuana.
10,If you are thinking of staying here to save some money don’t. The price isn’t worth how awful everything was. The whole place is disgusting dirty and dusty. The “updated” rooms had a dirty floor a running toilet A/C which didn’t work. The pool was extremely crowded and unpleasant and was closed one of the days because someone defecated in the pool. The fire alarms wake you up every night. I ultimately canceled my stay and went elsewhere as it was not a livable situation.
10,We went for our anniversary. We received a room with only 2 towels. When asking for extras I was talked to like I was the dirt on their shoe. Oh and nothing like getting woke up to an alarm going off for over a half hr to find out it’s just a minor incident
10,Adjoining rooms to people not traveling together made for a miserable night. Luckily went down in the wee hours of the morning and switched our room... but had to trek back upstairs since the room was only under my name to get my Id despite my husband having his and our last names being the same. Frustrating to say the least and staff was less than helpful with other questions.
20,Asked for more towels they brought pillows instead. This hotel was ran more off of how they could get you to go to timeshares instead of how they could make your trip better. This was not the hotel I remembered from 2010. Everything has changed and not for the better.
20,The good things about the Luxor it is clean. Fun and interesting. The bad things well where do I start? The toilet in our room had issues flushing the water didn’t fill high enough. The shower is “fancy” and only has half a door so the bathroom floor gets all wet. The safe only works sometimes. Other times it wouldn’t lock. It has an electronic code and always comes up with an error message. There was a knock on our door I asked who it was and they said maintenance and than mumbled something and walked away. I called the desk to ask and they said there was no order put in for maintenance. As we left our room we saw him knocking on all the doors. We notified the front desk and they had to try to figure that out. They had no idea. The 2nd night we stayed we woke up at 1 a.m. to an emergency alert alarm blaring a message for 15 to 20 minutes. They later said it was due to a minor incident. I than read reviews saying this alarm is faulty and goes off quite often.
20,Mother first time being in Vegas    She didn’t care for the room it was spots on the floors the room wasn’t clean she called you guys up there a couple times are usually stay at your hotel all the time I would expect I have that air service than the average person
