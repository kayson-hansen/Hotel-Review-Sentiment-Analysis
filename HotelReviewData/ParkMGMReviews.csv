10,It was sad how nice was the lobby and then u get to your room and it is so bad room wad dirty just a few towels had to use over now came to replace them not clean my room bed was not had i slept in the lobby it would have been better
50,Pretty much moms last tip she will not be able to travel any more. This was her favorite place to go. Wanted her to have one more trip before she got worse. Thank you for all you did. She was upset she did not win.
50,We definitely enjoyed our stay! The staff were friendly and the hotel was amazing! There are plenty of food options and the hotel is walking distance from a Target and restaurants & stores. Warning: They do charge $300 as a damage deposit and you will be reimbursed after your trip. So be aware of that. Besides that it was a great experience and it’s definitely a great place to stay! Security is also terrific since your card only sends you to your designated floor. Also the hot tub was amazing even during the colder times of the year!
50,My girlfriends and I came in for the rock ‘n roll race on the strip. We were so happy to stay at the Park MGM as it was non-smoking everywhere. We loved the spa/salon and the Fitness Center Eataly was also our favorite every day for breakfast and dinner- so many great options. Location was perfect and price was very fair. Will definitely be a topic for future visits to Vegas.
50,My daughter and I always stay here  excellent location great places to eat huge pool nice show room  easy walking to every thing coke store M & M store and the Hershey store Target Walgreens and CVS
40,The prices are ok. Your lungs will thank you as you won't be coughing up second hand smoke constantly. The dining options within very close walking distance offer something for everyone (and many places are great with food allergy options) the rooms are great only complaints in the Nomad room I stayed in was no free mini fridge to store things. There is 1 available for a daily fee. The beds are good but a bit on the stuff side and the pillows are extremely squishy and soft to the point you may need an extra 1. Regardless this is the best choice for a hotel.
10,Hotel was musky dirty and didn't drain in tune or sink. Remote was broken and everything was old and faded. Carpet dirty was overcharged after paying for room online was charged another 130 bucks after paying the 350 room rate. This is not legal nor fair to the consumer.
50,Great place from the steakhouse to the nightlife casinos convenience store Starbucks etc. staff was great and super helpful. I’d recommend this place to anyone visiting Las Vegas. Easy to get around and great service the whole time
50,First stay at Park MGM. Wanted to try it after years of staying in Mandalay Bay. Loved the non-smoking environment! Breakfast in the hotel restaurant was very good. Love the location near T-Mobile with easy access to Trams in both directions.
50,It’s a great place to stay but don’t touch that “mini bar” bc water is $18 on your bill and there’s no fridge. Great location & lots of stuff close by! Good walking spot and proxemics. It’s a nice place
50,Park MGM was a great hotel for our family vacation. The location was great and the room was clean and well stocked. We enjoyed room service and that was quick and easy. The digital app was also great because it made check in and check out really easy.
10,"We paid a LOT of money to stay here ($500/night for a couple of the nights) thinking we would have a great place to stay with our 7 year old for winter break. We chose the ""Stay Well"" room because it sounded great and very clean. The first room we were put in had obviously been smoked in and none of the amenities we had paid for worked. The digital key cards very rarely worked housekeeping and front desk didn't answer the phone and our room wasn't ready at check-in (the mobile check-in piece is terrible). I don't recommend staying here...I think there are much better hotels on the Strip or renting a house would have been a better experience."
30,We stay here at least once or twice a year for the past 3 or so years. We love the location of the property. We enjoy spending time gambling and the service staff was not near as good as in previous years.
50,I love that there is no smoking on this property. The location is great and the shuttle only steps away. There are many great food options. The Nomad lounge has great live music piano in the evenings.
50,Impeccable service ease of check-in nice spa facilities Dolby Live Theater convenient with enjoying performers cleanliness of hotel & casino Eataly food court tasty restaurants & all non-smoking….
50,I always try to stay at Park MGM! I never have a bad thing to say about them! I would recommend this property to everyone! Smoke free rooms are clean great location amazing staff restaurants are so good and the pool is nice!
40,Staff was nice and helpful location is very convenient and perfect. The hallways and rooms were not the cleanest and did not give the impression of high quality room. When you come to Vegas you want to be impressed. Did not leave the hotel feeling that way.
10,"We booked 2 rooms (friends of ours and us) back in December ""guaranteed strip view"". The only reason we booked with them was we wanted a guarantee on strip view. Cost more to do so but it's what we wanted. Plenty of other places less expensive but no guarantee. We get in at 2:30am and wait on line to check in for over 30 minutes (I get it can't have lots of people on that late). When our friends get to the desk they tell them their room isn't strip view. None available. It's late. We're tired and just want to check in. Our check in agent says something like ""it should already be assigned"" but apparently that room was given to someone else. The agreed to knocking off the resort fees only after they complained that the first 2 offers of waiving 1 day resort fees then 2 days seemed paltry. Said to come back in the am to see what we could do. My friend and I arrive at the desk around 9 and I started talking. I asked how we could book guaranteed strip view and not get it. The desk agent said that wasn't possible to book and its by availability which was factually not true according to our confirmed reservation. I had to keep repeating myself that we in fact booked that but by the third time she started to ignore me and speaking to my friend. When I said ""oh so know you're just going to ignore me"" I was told that I was being loud and rude yet she was the one talking over me the guest when I had the email with the confirmed strip view. My friend being British was getting very uncomfortable confrontation and in the interest of avoiding further conflict said it was fine and insisted we walk away. My son who works in Hotel Operations called it an involuntary downgrade and said it's arguably the worst thing you could do to someone checking in. Said that's an absolute last resort and he'd rather walk someone to a nearby hotel with the same or better accommodations as our booking rather than do what the hotel did. Said they'd also immediately offer the first night free on any involuntary downgrade. In addition our request on our respective room reservation was to be nearby each other. While I realize that is by availability we were on 21 them 11. So when you ask why I'd give them a 1 on likely to recommend (from what I understand that's THE metric for hotels) you can see why. Screwed us on the booking the proximity to each other then your agent being rude."
50,Great Hotel on the Strip. Eately is a great place to find lots of food choices and hang out with friends.  Babbetts is a great steak house with hidden speakeasy.    Rooms are nice and clean Staff is wonderful and friendly
50,Overall fantastic experience. Fully non-smoking was a huge selling feature.We really liked the central strip location felt like a lot of attractios were within an accessible distance. Great on-site food options- Side Betty Grill's portions on things like sweet potato fries dried beans and onion rings were huge and sharable and they're open 24 hours.    Front desk staff was very friendly. We were in a 2 queen strip view room on the bottom floor (23) of NoMad. Room was a good size with a huge sofa- we had a rented scooter in the space and the 4 of us had no issues moving around. Beds are quite fit but comfortable- O usually prefer a softer mattress but actually found this quite comfortable. Bathroom was a bit awkward around the sink and not too large but shower was great.    First night we were wanting to call down for some extra towels but found that our phone wasn't working properly. We could only call on speaker when it was in the cradle which was awkward and hard to hear when we called to tell them about the issue. They sent an engineer up within 10 minutes. Silvestre C was super friendly shared some tips about the property and even gave us a little food credit for the inconvenience.    This is only our second time to Vegas and we did stay at a different property last year. This is an annual trip for us. Given our experience at the Park MGM we have 100% found our resort of choice.
50,Visited Park MGM several times in the past 2 months once to celebrate NY once for MLK weekend and once for a birthday celebration.    Each visit was a memorable one with special touches. For NY you can watch several fireworks show just by stepping outside the Eataly (fabulous!) Italian food courtyard onto the Strip. The restaurant and casino staff were in festive wear and passing out party favors.    We had a wonderful champagne toast courtesy of the bar managers. In fact the bar staff was a high point of the visit. Michelle W. the bar manager was on hand bubbly and friendly making sure all guests were enjoying themselves. She especially checked in on our party which included a service dog and wheelchair guest to ensure that we were properly seated and served. The servers and bartenders were quite calm and efficient given that the NY crowd was large and ready to celebrate. Servers Paula and Rob bartenders Juan and Chris were our favorites and we often returned to the high limits bar knowing that we would always have a warm welcome. They were especially good at making recommendations and coming up with excellent concoctions based on whatever mood we were in that the time. The espresso martinis are top-notched and incomparable!    The other visits reflected the consistency of great hospitality that the Park MGM/Nomad offers. The staff always greets returning guests by name and often remember our diners preferences as well. For the birthday celebration they even took note and we all shared birthday cake together! Michelle W. put in an appearance and even brought out our favorite wines and champagne. I can’t emphasize enough how welcomed and comfortable they make us feel. I look forward to each visit and only reluctantly leave each time.
40,"Stayed for a personal solo trip and enjoyed my time at the Park MGM.    From the start Park MGM is technology forward. You can check-in on the app and receive the parking pass on the app before you actually arrive which is nice. In the app you have the option of getting a digital key and a QR code to print a digital key without needing to talk to the front desk.    I stayed mid-building and the elevators were usually efficient except when there were events going on (be it a concert of a sporting event) which then caused some delays getting back up to the room. Even then it wasn't a super long wait since they had all 6 elevators running.    The room itself was quite large. I got a king sized bed and there was a very wide couch against the window. My view was facing T-Mobile arena and I rarely heard street noise other than when there was a sporting event whereby they placed a ""goal"" sound. In the room there isn't much amenities (e.g. microwave nor fridge). There is a snack panel that is touch sensor up to 60 seconds and that's about it; I got dinged for it by no fault of my own and they credited me back. The bed was comfortable enough though not plush to my likings. Bathroom was large and they stocked the regular shampoo and conditioner and soaps. The towels themselves were great.    Location-wise the hotel is in a good spot though being on the south end you do need to do a bit more walking. Nearby there are a lot of places to eat if you wanted to eat outside Eataly as well as convenience stores. I personally loved that it is smoke free as when I went to grab food or outside I didn't have to smell anything.    Overall the stay was highly enjoyable and would stay here again."
50,We just completed a trip with 16 people to celebrate a birthday at park mgm. I highly recommend staying here! This casino is smoke free! Service is great and the food is out of this world! We ate at my Best Friend it was delicious!
50,As mentioned this is the first time I have stayed there.    Was in Vegas for the wedding of my daughter. We had about 10 different rooms (including 3 suites). With so many rooms some many of us and all arriving at different times things could have easily gone wrong and been difficult. However this was not the case and was the complete opposite.    During check-in Ana at the front desk went out of her way to assist us. She did everything she could to make sure we were all in the same tower (part of the hotel). She helped to assign rooms and have everything prepared. Check-in for everyone went easily. The previous evening I had checked in with Gentina and she was very helpful.    The rooms were clean and well laid out. The bell desk was quick and responsive. The front desk which we had to call several times were quick to address any concerns we had.    The staff were amazing went above and beyond to accommodate almost all of our requests. And there were plenty of different requests we had. Some team members even went out of their way to congratulate the newlyweds and bring gifts.    Obviously with such a big party playing the tables together (blackjack) could be challenging. However several of the pit bosses did what they could to accommodate our party. Particularly Martin who went out of his way for us. Thou Andy and Simon also went out of their way to accommodate us. On several occasions they made changes on the table so that our entire “gambling party” could sit at 2 tables next to each other. Simon presented the newlyweds with a generous comp. Another evening Martin was so thrilled with the newlyweds that he gave them additional comps and even gave a comp to the father of the groom.    When everyone was ready to leave there were unforeseen weather conditions that closed roads and delayed flights. I was one of those who had flight delays. I decided to stay an additional night as did several other guests from our party. Ace the front desk manager went out of his way to help me.    Everyone in our entire party had a phenomenal time. And the staff the services and professionalism are what helped to make it possible.    Will be staying there again on my next visit.
40,I have asthma and was happy that all their facilities on property are non-smoking. I enjoyed using the outdoor pool and spa tub while we were there. The resort fees are cringy and unexpected though especially for a first-timer to Vegas.
10,This place feels like a tourist trap because you have to go an annoying chore filled adventure every morning just to get a cup of coffee. Their main restaurant Eataly has no coffee at the main restaurant and it’s not clear that there are other restaurants that do have it on the far end from the resort down some stairs. The Starbucks within Park MGM also doesn’t allow you to order ahead so you have to wait in a line of at leave 40 people to get a coffee. Another issue I had was that the digital room key failed on multiple occasions because there is no service in the elevators where you have to use the key to get to your floor.
50,I would highly recommend Park MGM and will absolutely stay there again. My top 5 reasons are:    1. Smoke free  2. Restaurants  3. Location on the strip  4. Well maintained (great spa and pool as well)  5. Fairly priced
40,"Great price great location and fantastic amenities! ""Eataly"" and ""Best Friends"" alone is worth the stay! We will definitely be back soon! My only complaints are that there wasn't even a mini fridge in the room and you have to pay $35 per day to rent one."
10,1. I could tell from the greeting we got at the front desk that service would be inadequate. The individual checking us in was not friendly (no eye contact) made little effort to get us the rooms we reserved didn't offer a discount after downgrading our room until I asked and didn't even point us to the elevators to our rooms after finishing the check in.  2. If I am going to pay up front for 2 rooms then at least you should let me secure/reserve the rooms I requested (adjoining rooms with view). We were downgraded to a 4th floor room overlooking the garbage. This is not how reservations work.  3. We could not sleep in the morning because it was so noisy outside with the trucks and there was constant banging coming from above us (trash shoot or maintenance room above or next to us?!?).  4. In room dining service was subpar in terms of quality of food (dinner and breakfast) and the ease of ordering. The individuals taking the phone calls made ordering difficult and were borderline rude.    I would not stay at this property again.
30,We stayed there for the weekend while Louis are you totally ready for tomorrow find out set up Louis like what do you need to do to get ready for tomorrow? Is your room by room schools anything to you tomorrow hundred percent sure don’t think it would be is my Alex but I didn’t pan things any projects tests OK we caught a couple of shows. The Dolby live theater is on property which is nice. We were not satisfied with our room. Small dark and beaten up furniture. Overall judgment was that this is an over priced property that gets away with it because it’s on the strip. I don’t plan on staying there again.
10,If you are a golf member and get notified about MGM benefits do not assume those will be available to you.    The hotel is average and the rooms are tired. It’s impossible to get an Uber from this property also.
50,Always enjoy staying here at the Park. We had a very nice room- a Nightengale suite. Enjoyed dining at Bavettes Primrose and in Eataly too. Played a variety of slots during the stay. All of the staff seemed to be very helpful too.
50,I love staying at the Park. The location the mobile check-in amenities cleanliness and smoke free environment are just a few reasons why I have only stayed at The Park. I am able to take the free tram to Bellagio or Aria. I can find affordable food options close by. I will be back and recommend this resort to families visiting Vegas anytime of the year.
20,Some good elements: smoke-free. Okay food options. Central location on the strip.    The bad: horrible room. Cramped with old elements. It had a connecting door and thin walls (easily hear both neighbors so good luck sleeping). Shower tub was clogged so you finish showers in ankle deep water. It also took us 35 minutes in line to check-in. The front desk seemed like they were scrambling to get us into a room last minute despite our reservation. Not a fun first-impression. We were told we should’ve checked in online with the MGM app but it wasn’t working.    Overall I would just never stay here again. It felt like money wasted.
40,My wife and I loved the central location of this MGM property and feel it’s a well connected to getting around on the Las Vegas Strip. Very Clean! The property is well lit and feels safe. We love the connecting tram to Bellagio!
50,Love thus non-smoking hotel. The best beds and excellent service. Hotel is very well located and parking is easy. Mahalo to MGM for acknowledging our military families with a rewards card that gets bonus benefits!
10,watch out as they allow others to charge to your room then won’t listen when you call in. Was told it was impossible they made a mistake. Ya right like my underage daughter bought wine and sardines from Eataly. Sad and horrible service.
20,wasn’t happy with my stay they still charged me 44$ for leaving early the restroom didn’t work properly and they still charged me for parking of 30$ and they didn’t even bother to ask me why I was leaving early
50,Very nice hotel with tram to Aria Crystal shops and Bellagio. Room was modern decor and bathroom shower large. Big flat screen TV. Cool Starbucks Super friendly. Check in gave us a super room😀😀😀😀😀
50,We had a 4 night stay and thought the beds were comfortable and the view was nice. Eataly is a great place for food options. The casino is non smoking which we liked. Easy hotel to navigate not a long walk to elevators.
40,This resort has the right idea for Vegas. A smoke free environment which I was very grateful for. Location is on the strip just north of Excalibur. This facility has comfortable beds and nice rooms. Eataly provides options for eating variety. This resort is a good option to be on the strip in a low key place
50,First-time at Park MGM (though MGM properties are a go-to constant for me when visiting Las Vegas) for a trade show and I couldn’t have been happier with the experience. Super location on the Strip with easy tram access to Aria and Bellagio… Immaculate room and nice amenities (though a second chair in the room would have been helpful… shout-out for the superb water pressure in the shower!)… Great selection of restaurants with Bavette’s steak house an absolute favorite… Conference center was like-wise first rate and I particularly appreciated that it’s “compact” not sprawling as at so many other properties. And the two biggest pluses for me… The non-smoking environment which makes an enormous difference even compared to places with top notch air filtration systems… And always! fantastic highly professional staff in every department… I’ll certainly return!
50,Eat Alt is the star attraction here. We literally ate dinner here every night. Hotel service was great Bell Service was responsive. Good location on the strip. All -non smoking was the main attraction
50,Great place. I liked that it was it a little smaller than other resorts and in a less busy area of the strip. The tram was great to use to get further up the strip without having to walk the whole way.
50,Nice smoke free hotel comfy beds and great staff didn’t worry about bringing the kids along. Wish there was more to do during the winter months though. App is easy enough to use wish there was a coffee machine in the room tho
50,Rooms were very clean. Hotel was clean. Enjoyed a smoke free casino. Walking distance to enjoy the strip. Nice to know you have to have a key to get on your floor. Helps you feel safe. Sucks having to pay a resort fee when you only stay there to sleep.
40,Beautiful clean rooms with no smoking inside the property.  The staff was friendly and they have Etaly as a restaurant.  Located in the heart of the strip.  Nice craps tables but minimums jump to $25 in the evening.
40,We really enjoyed this property. Had a slight problem at check-in but it was resolved quickly. Although we did not receive the room that we had originally thought we were going to get that was disappointing but overall we had a great week. The property is very nice and I love the fact that it is non-smoking. Very clean and friendly.
40,Went for 4 nites checked in earlyish  they let us know when room was ready. Stored bags with bell staff.  Room was very nice. Had the Stay Well King. Smoke free casino was great!    The hallways are somewhat worn and could have been vacuumed more often but didn't take away from experience.    Read some travelers didn't like the bed too hard or something like that.  It was great for me pillows nice too.  I will say the bed was a little low for me. Kind of a drop and getting up a bit of an effort but got used to it.    Staff was very helpful including housekeeping.    Eataly was too chaotic! Didn't care for the setup and of course it was $$. Favorite part was Lavazza Coffee.    Didn't use pool or hot tub but saw people enjoying it from our room view. We were on the go all the time or would have checked it out.    Will definitely consider staying here again. Don't be put off by the negative Nellies regarding this property!
50,LOVED THST GGE WHOLE FACILITY IS NON SMOKING Super convenient to get to the conference center and rooms. Smaller property. Did not have to walk thru a smoke filled casino to get to rooms or conference center.
50,I couldn't wait to get back to my room at Park MGM after seeing shows at other hotels. I had no smoke in my hair and my allergies were great. It was nice not to have red eyes from being others who smoke.
40,The hotel was very accommodating and I really liked and appreciated the smoke-free atmosphere. I also went to the Jonas Brothers Vegas residency so the venue they were playing at was right inside the venue which was very convenient and nice.
50,Excellence in all areas at Park MGM…location location location. Slots……clean…...value…..food….the rewards program plus credit card from MGM is definitely worth it and highly recommended…..oh!!! Free parking if you get MGM master card plus more
50,We had a great experience! Nothing made me wish I was staying elsewhere! The only service/cleanliness issue was that housekeeping did not attend our room until our 4th of 5 days. We needed to call the main desk for new hand towels toilet paper and kleenex.
10,I chose this location because it felt like it was going to be eco friendly. No water bottle filling sessions limited organic options rooms are small with no mini fridge or places to put luggage. It was just ok. Very limited entertainment options.
40,The hotel overall was great. I’m giving a 4/5 because there was no refrigerator or coffee machine included with price of room which was already high in my opinion. I feel that these basics should be provided.
50,Park MGM is in a perfect centralized location and amenities are easily accessible. I am a morning coffee person so a Starbucks needs to be close to the elevators in the lobby. Tram was easy to get to also.
50,A great hotel with plenty of food offerings vibational rooms a fantastic location on the strip!!! Check-in with the Mobile Check-in is a great way to bypass the line headed for the desk. Just ask!!!
50,Casinos clean and nicely renovated. Could use more slot and blackjack machines that I prefer found out other MGM casinos. Minor issue when events are at the arena next to the casino creating very long lines to get out of the parking garage. I am a huge fan of MGM casinos I have the credit card this allows additional rewards and free rooms. Also you can play free slot and blackjack game by MyVegas blackjack / casino and cops as well.
50,We loved the fact we didn't have to walk through clouds of smoke to get to our room. It would have been nice to have a microwave in the room. Parking can be a bear on the evenings when there are special concerts or events.
50,My wife and I just stayed here for the first time. It was really pleasant to have a fully smoke-free casino and hotel environment. The hotel dining options including Eataly are very good. The location on the strip is near tram stations which makes adventures on the strip easier.
40,We really like this hotel. It was not too big so we didn't get lost. It is beautiful smells great and has some great restaurants and bars. Lala Noodle and Eataly were our favorites and we also liked Juniper bar. The room is also spacious and comfortable.
30,Rude front desk and the food we ordered for room service was horrible the $78 we spent on the food was not worth it at all we should of just went some where else to eat. Other then that it wasn’t to bad of a stay
30,I won’t stay here again. Everything felt old dark and a little old.    My room had no view and the room layout and quality was poor.    I will never stay at the Park MGM again. I’m sure it will work for some people but not this guy.
10,Where do I even start the mobile app never worked constantly kicked me out. The elevators never could recognize the app and I had to ride the thing to every floor but mine. Rooms are tiny dated and not cleaned well. Literally looked like I was walking into a 70’s porno. The bed was terrible woke up every morning in the middle of the bed because it was so bowed. The staff never once asked how I was or even made eye contact. I will say the water pressure in the shower was good so I guess there’s that! All in all there are many places to stay in Vegas this would not be at the top of my list or even in the middle…
10,The rooms are dark dingy and not very clean. Leftover trash from previous people. The beds are old and uncomfortable. There was no fridge in the room. The floors look like they have not been vacummed in weeks. The hotel hallways are also dirty.
40,Overall the hotel is great because it's all non-smoking and smells amazing! Also little Eataly was awesome! All the different restaurants and little bars were great. Rooms could be a little cleaner but overall not bad.
30,First room was full of hair and food still. Digital and key cards stop working after first day. Housekeeping had to be called to come to room. Hotel did refund unused amenities (early and late check out fee).
50,Im a smoker and staying @ a smoke free hotel is worth it the whole property was clean and sealed amazing!!! The shower with the water pressure was on point though I wish they had larger (dispenser) bath amenities and an extra roll of toilet paper.
30,No handicap rooms with two queen beds. Kings only. With a friend in a wheelchair and told I would have two queens when I booked with MGM Rewards. When I checked in I was told there were only king HDCP rooms. Clerk acted like it was my fault. Room amenities sparse!
50,The ParkMGM is the perfect spot to base your Las Vegas vacation. It's close to everything you're going want to do. The whole strip is but a tram or short uber ride away. This hotel is also within walking distance to a wide variety of food choices too.
50,Love staying at Park MGM - beautiful hotel friendly staff lots of foods restaurants plenty of action going on CVS next door U can go over to New York New York casino they have a great corn beef restaurant inside. Love the location
50,It was a great time staying here! Would recommend using the mgm resort app! Best way to check in and search for dinner locations or make reservation or trying to buy tickets to a show great app to use!
10,Dirty room upon arrival - used products from previous occupant. Long time for fridge to arrive. No microwaves available. App not working for check in. Very slow app for digital room key. Good food. Nice staff and casino. Only pro is non smoking hotel.
10,House keeping came into my room with my “do not disturb” sign on my door knob. Took things from bags food containers were thrown away. They only wanted to give me 100 voucher but told them to use it towards my room but they should have comped my whole stay
10,Not worth the money. Hidden fees in the hundreds. No reservations available in restaurants so could barely use the meal credits I purchased in advance. No tub. View of the strip included view of the roof and plumbing for the resort. Was so happy to leave and spend the rest of my trip in friend’s guest room. Last time I’ll stay at an MGM property.
50,Great resort in the right location for everything you want to do. Great rooms restaurants and completely Nonsmoking. Eataly makes the stay worthwhile all by itself! Amazing food bev choices! repeat repeat repeat  repeat
50,We love this place! My husband and I really appreciate that it’s completely non-smoking. The rooms are clean and spacious. There are three pools to choose from and lots of restaurants The bonus is the staff and service they provide! They go above and beyond to make sure our stay is better than we could ever imagine. Every time we stay there the food and beverage managers and their staff provide the absolute best service imaginable! Michelle the GM along with manager Ben bartenders Antony Vavi Dustin and server Roz make us feel like valuable family members. Of course having great restaurants and shopping places like Eataly and Lala noodles give us everything we need if we don’t want to leave the property. They have great entertainment and are part of the MGM family. We love coming back to the Park MGM!
50,Just a great place to stay at est at snd gamble at. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Hotel was very clean. Best of all it is non smoking. Awesome place to stay at. The Eatery is amazing. So much to choose from.
30,This MGM hotel was Smoke free We were looking for a place for the busy weekend. Warm and cozy place to stay with a good location and ease of coming and going. Lacks the Las Vegas vibe. The Bed was worn and comfortable.
50,Great experience after all. Casino Hotel and restaurants are great. We like staying here every time we can a en have a trip to Las Vegas. Pleasure soccer tournament family gathering any occasion we’ll stay here always! Specially that Casino and resort are 100% smoke free… that’s a big plus when having full family with us.
50,The hotel was honestly amazing loved the location rooms were a good size and clean. Check in/ check out was very easy through my phone and I also liked the fact that my phone is my key. Overall it was a great experience would definitely love to stay here again.
50,I love the fact that it is SMOKE free and the staff are helpful and are smiling. Has wonderful places to eat and over all just clean. I love the where the Park MGM is located on the strip the atmosphere has a positive effect on you.
50,MGM is my go to place! The friendliness efficiency and amenities are awesome! The staff are very welcoming and helpful. They go out of their way to make sure guests are happy and well taken care. And the shows outstanding!
50,Love the fact that it is non smoking but it also has all the items you love about Las Vegas!! I have a lung condition and had stoped coming to Vegas because of the smoke!! Very happy with the choice of non smoking.
50,rooms were comfortable plenty of eateries hassle free and service staff were extremely friendly and courteous. Great location with plenty of shopping around. Will stay here again if i return to Las Vegas
50,This hotel is luxuriously decorated. The room Incredible. Plus everything that there is to do in Vegas can be done at the Park and in style. Food drink gaming shows pool shopping and on and on. We arrived with our friends and made new ones.
30,I was not thrilled with our room it was to small and it did not have a refrigerator it’s always nice to keep drinks cold. I personally would not go back. To many children walking around and screaming not good
50,Me and some girlfriends stayed at Park MGM to go to the show downstairs at Dolby. This was our second time for the same event! Absolute incredible experience and will 1000% be staying here again next time we are in Vegas.
50,Staff was very nice and accommodating. The rooms are clean and the beds are comfortable. Housekeeping came by everyday when we were out and made our beds and provided us with fresh towels. I really liked the fact that the casino didn't smell like smoke. They have really nice restaurants such as eataly and Primrose. We ate at Primrose and we felt like we were dining in Europe. Very nice vibe. This hotel is also in a good location. Across the street from the ABC store. Almost everything on the strip is walking distance from it. Would definitely recommend and stay here again!
50,This place has it all! Centrally located to all great major attractions. Move about to the different casinos on the tram. Also great gaming and the rooms are spacious and hip. The smell is was heavenly. I stayed twice already.
40,Last minute trip for some R & R fun. We always have a great time in Vegas first time staying at Park MGM. Good location and many options for food. Ideal location for any T-Mobile arena event very busy the weekend we went.
50,I really like the cleanliness of the room  they don’t look old and they look new .. this is the 2nd time I stay here … they have everything connected and we did not have to pay for the train … I like the food options..
50,I had fun playing blackjack at this casino one evening. Dealer Rosemary was particularly engaging and cheerful and helped several new players gain a better understanding of the game which calmed their fears and made it more enjoyable for all. I also witnessed another dealer handle a rowdy customer in a stern yet courteous and professional manner. I look forward to playing here again. During my visit I attended a Bruno Mars concert which was amazing! The size of the theater the great sight lines and excellent acoustics further enhanced this talented artist's performance.
50,All my friends and family always stay here. This is our favorite hotel casino on the strip. We Absolutely love the food. We Love the rooms. The Beds are sooo comfy. Always clean. Every one is very nice
10,Mobile check in did not work. The garbage can had rotting fruit in it from a previous stay. Put the can out in hallway where it sat for the weekend. I could write my name in dust on the furniture as well as the comforter. Room was musty. No coffee maker or fridge in room. Bathroom was extremely small and cramped. Not at all what I expected.
30,Hard to believe that a hotel of this caliber and price point doesn’t provide simple basics such as coffee/tea in room. The bottled Figi water in room was $18…The location was great and the casino floor etc was awesome too we just found that the beautiful vibe didn’t carry over into the guest rooms at all.
40,Nice value for money. Eataly was a wonderful place to eat. Especially there were nice desert shops in Eataly. Easy to check in and out in the beautiful lobby. But the furniture in a room looked old. The bathroom was too small even though a shower booth was very clean.
50,We arrived for an Anniversary trip and were met with a very friendly front desk lady who helped check us in. We had a small problem with the sink not draining correctly and a maintenance man was there within 5 mins of our request. He too was friendly and polite. Our housekeeper made our stay. She arranged a surprise in our room for our Anniversary. All in all we had a lovely relaxing trip made all the better by the fabulous staff employed by this hotel.
50,I absolutely love Park MGM. The smoke free policy alone is reason enough to stay here but there are plenty of others. Rooms are beautifully appointed the location is fantastic and there are wonderful food options at every price point. NoMad library is not to be missed.    Check in and out is a breeze thanks to the mobile app. And one underrated point of importance is that the Uber pickup is easy to get to unlike most strip hotels.    It’s pretty much perfect! Park MGM has become my go-to spot for Vegas displacing all of my prior allegiance to Caesars properties.
50,Great place to stay  was close to all the other happening casinos there was great restaurants in the hotel. Rooms were very clean and comfortable. The whole staff was very friendly and helpful.will definitely come back and recommend to others.
40,very nice hotel in a great location on the strip with easy indoor walking access to the Aria Vdara Bellagio and other venues. Price is great if there isn't a huge event going on at the time. Rooms are nice clean and comfortable. Have great restaurants on the resort.
50,Excellent corporate retreat. Catering was delicious and accommodations for event were superb. No issues whatsoever.  Loved smoke free environment and all staff were friendly and kind.  Food was delicious throughout and we loved hang outs at Nomad.
50,I would recommend this property and would definitely stay here again it has become one of my favorites.  The casino layout is very convenient and the main bar is great due to friendly and knowledgeable bartenders.
10,I didn't like this hotel. There were no towels in my bathroom. They were in the closet. My safe didn't work. They put me in the farthest room from the elevator and i looked out at the parking lot with the garbage.
40,Stayed for a long weekend at Park MGM. Hotel was really nice. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Our room was very clean the beds were a little saggy but adequate. No refrigerator in the room. Overall the room was clean and comfortable. The casino is nice and nonsmoking. The property felt very safe We asked for and were given a late checkout and were not charged for it. The only thing that annoyed me was being charged $18 for a bottle of Fiji water from our minibar. I expected it to be expensive but that was ridiculous. Easy check in easy checkout. We would stay again.
40,It was very nice we stayed for two nights and it was enjoyable. We played many of the casino games and dining experiences. Side Betty’s was a 24/7 food place that was always there when we needed her.
40,Great friendly and welcoming staff. The hotel smelled very clean and fresh in the hotel. Very comfy beds. The shower was very nice and great pressure. Love the location it is pretty center on the strip.
40,Awesome clean and non smoking hotel/casino! The King room was adequate with a great bathroom. Friendly staff and Eatily is a fabulous expansive option for dinning. I would without reservation vouch for Park MGM
50,The service is fast to take your reservation payment but extremely slow to get and settle in your room. The bell folks were nice and delivered my luggage within three minutes of calling.  Security deposit is way 2 much money at $100 per night. Which was a surprise considering I thought they paid one flat fee of $150 for your time there. And they were slow in releasing it back after check out
30,For a hotel that is supposed to be smoke free the room smelled like cigarette smoke. Bed and sheets were clean and the bed always makes it easy to fall asleep. TV was nice and big but the food selection is kind of limited aside from LALA Noodle and the two $$$$.
30,The comps are few and inconsistent. However the overall hotel and casino is excellent. The staff is efficient and gives excellent customer service  the rooms are clean and we'll maintained . t  The overall non smoking atmosphere is great
40,I love the smell of the hotel when we first walked in. There is a self check-in and check-out which is nice. Plenty of security around so made me feel safe. Our room was a decent size for two people and a king bed. I wouldn’t mind it being bigger. Bathroom was decent too. Overall I would come back again. It wasn’t too far from Paris Planet Hollywood and NY NY. Also we discovered an indoor walk to Aria which was awesome when it’s cold outside. I didn’t realize Aria was that close.
30,If you want a quiet room don’t stay on the lower floors facing the T-Mobile arena. The shower head didn’t look clean. The shower leaked on the bathroom floor. I stayed on the 6th floor room 127. Elevators were quick. I liked Eataly.
50,This is the only smoke free campus on the strip. Really enjoyed the environment. Great restaurants on site. Easy access to Dolby Live theatre. Room was very spacious. Check in and check out is swift. You can by pass the front desk using the MGM app.
50,I treated my neice to a trip to Las Vegas for her 52 birthday. I was able to located Park MGM online. I had never stayed at this hotel before but it looked to be okay and the price was right. I'm so glad I made the reservation. We were very impressed by our experience!
50,The Monte Carlo has been transformed into a fabulous ParkMGM property. Rooms are great; food is excellent; slots are loose! The Nomad Bar is great as is Best Friend - Korean/Mexican Fusion by Roy Choi.
50,Everything about this hotel is awesome. Staff. Restaurants. Location. Salon. Pools are beautiful. Hotel itself is beautiful and non smoking.  Location is Great if you’re attending a LV Knights game!! You just have to walk across the street.
50,I was impressed at the ease of check-in as well as the friendly staff. The location of the venue to see Bruno Mars was also exceptional. It's always been my dream to stay at a MGM property in Las Vegas.
50,The location of Park MGM is really ideal. Grap something quick at the lobby store or across the bridge at ABC store. Having the tram right there is nice too. Nonsmoking unique restaurants and a decent size casino are a bonus. Favorite places to eat are Primrose for breakfast Best Friends and LaLa Noodle for dinner and Eataly any time of day.
50,Couldn’t be happier to stay at the Park MGM. Good fun dancing drink gambling food. Will be booking again for October. Hope to have the same type of good time again. Thank you for the great experience.
40,Best place to stay if you are a non smoker hands down. The walls are thin so you hear a bit more than you want to hear in a Vegas hotel however the staff were accommodating in moving rooms in hope for a better stay.
50,Great location great restaurants love that the entire place is non smoking. Food is a little pricey but it’s Vegas! Had a rental car and parking was free in the hotel parking garage with our MGM Military Veterans Program card. You’re automatically upgraded to Pearl status with this card so if your military I highly recommend getting the rewards card. Lots of perks with it.
50,The park m g m is in amazing location perfectly situated with all the things a person needs for your trip. The ability to use the tram to travel from this resort to many others makes it a perfect place
50,The room was so dark we didn’t even know how late it was 😂😂 dining was amazing the Italian market was amazing so much great stuff to look at and taste the slot selection was amazing enjoyed everything about it couldn’t complain about anything thank you
20,the room was not even up to par with a Hampton Inn. No coffee maker no refrigerator the furniture was cheap the bed was uncomfortable. the room was not serviced that day. Not what i expected from a Las Vegas primary hotel.
10,Average rooms. Not a lot inside room no fridge or coffee. Barely any storage. Rooms looked very old dated and even smelled like it. Staff was ok. Location was great for the concert we attended at Dolby which was the only reason we stayed.
50,From check in to check out we couldn’t be happier. When you have people in your party who are smokers that actually became happy about staying at The ONLY smoke free hotel in Las Vegas you are doing something right!
40,We liked the location and we loved that it is a smoke free property. Extremely convenient for us since we had two shows at the Park MGM… Bruno Mars at Dolby Live and The Secret Study magic show at Nomad Library. We were woken up by the EXTREMELY loud DJ in the TMobile arena before a Knights game. The bed was comfortable and the blackout curtains worked great. Would stay again but request a room away from the arena due to the potential noise. The best part of staying at Park MGM was the quick easy walk to the Aria hotel!
30,Fine service Ethernet is disabled in rooms now contrary to prior reviews. This made it difficult to work in the room since the Wi-Fi is appallingly slow. Otherwise the building room and staff are fine.
50,Loved the entire experience at Park MGM. Clean and comfortable rooms extremely friendly staff great location and a good variety of food and gaming options. Would recommend to anyone visiting Las Vegas.
50,Cleaniness was great  the staff was friendly and very helpful . Great environment  GREAT FOOD . Great entertainment great Value and will come back again and great location close 2 very thing !!!!!!!!!!
50,Very easy check in process on the MGM app. The staff is always friendly. The rooms are nice and comfortable. . Always a good experience. We enjoy being in a non-smoking environment. I love staying here and recommend it to all my friends and family.
50,Love that it's non smoking! I felt comfortable bringing my friends and parents to this hotel because its non smoking! And I super like that Eataly is im the hotel and has so many different food options!
50,Really enjoy the no smoking policy my wife is very allergic to cigarette smoke. Rooms are clean but do not have fridges or coffee machines. Also no fan in the bathroom area to remove excess moisture and odours.
40,"This was our first time staying at Park MGM - we usually stay at Bellagio or Caesars. The staff were wonderful and the casino was really good with a lot of options for slot machines. The location is great and the tram is a nice option to go to Aria or Bellagio. The only real ""problem"" (if you want to call it that) is that the room was a little dated. Overall a nice place to stay on the strip."
40,Mgm resort app is very misleading when it comes to the rules for Freeplay. I wish I had been told to present my card at all the restaurants I spent thousands at as my total free play with just gaming and the 4 nights stay added up to a total of $4 in free play that turns out is not accessible because $10 is the minimum to be able to use your free play on any gaming.
50,Would definitely stay here again. Non-smoking casino was great. Location was nice in that we could easily walk to or ride the free tram to many casinos. We rented a car right at the Bell Desk which was very convenient for our day trip to Hoover Dam. My only minor complaint is there isn't a lot of room to unpack in the room. There are four small drawers in the closet - but would have rather had a dresser. The shower was fantastic!
50,The Park MGM staff is #1 at every aspect of customer service. I travel the U.S. frequently and this hotel is my favorite. Every restaurant is great the lobby and concierge staff is exceptional. The facility and rooms are great as well. I will not stay anywhere else in Las Vegas
50,The hotel is beautiful the staff took great care of us and our room was spotless. I really appreciate that it is non-smoking. The location is perfect for an exciting and fun visit now to enjoy everything is Vegas has to offer.
50,The staff is great and the location on the strip is ideal! And it’s totally smoke free! Very easy to drive in and out or take the tram to Bellagio. Plenty of restaurants to choose from no matter your taste or craving.
40,I was kinda worried about this stay but it was overall very nice. I was here two nights. First night was peaceful and quiet. Second night had loud neighbors and vibrations in the building from a concert or bar (hard to tell what/where it was).  The room was clean. I saw one bug.  The bed was too soft for my taste.  The shower was fantastic.  The casino was nice and it was fabulous not to smell smoke.
50,We stayed at the Park MGM for the third time and we are so pleased. Very friendly staff clean rooms and smokeless casino. It is in the best location on the strip. We are able to go to several of the other casinos with minimal walking. We will be back!
50,A great place to stay ... not only is it centrally located it is clean comfortable and the service was the best. This was our first trip after my husband's disability and the accomodations were perfect and the staff could not do enough to make him feel welcome and comfortable. Dolby Live staff was particularly accomodating.
50,Had an amazing time at the Park MGM!! Went to the Bruno Mars concert and it was incredible!! This is a must do if you never seen his show!! The entire MGM staff was great!! From the front desk casino floor clubs bar sportsbook & housekeeping all top notch service!! The only drawback was the pregame festivities for Las Vegas Knights was not a good look...Booming club music at 8a after partying all night was brutal!! Prolly not Park MGM fault but was cool!! Great time otherwise!!
50,My friend Lilly and I went over to Park MGM to find some free bet blackjack since Aria was packed and over priced. We sat at a table with Katie and she was the best dealer we have ever had. She made our experience enjoyable because of her positive attitude and helpful Demeanor. We will make sure to look for her every time we go in to play at the tables and I think everyone should as well. Thank you Katie!
50,Park MGM’s smoke-free environment has converted me from a Caesar’s Rewards Diamond to an MGM Rewards Gold member. I’ll never again spend more than an hour or so in a smoky casino. The only complaint I had was the outside noise from Toshiba Plaza blaring into my room before 9 am on Super Bowl Sunday. Better soundproofing would upgrade the Park MGM experience but the pros far outweigh the cons at this hotel. Best place to gamble in Vegas by far!
50,Our first trip to Las Vegas was very enjoyable. The hotel is beautiful the staff is friendly and helpful and the cost was reasonable. Restaurants and Bars were very nice as well. The location on the Strip was great we were able to use the tram & monorail to get around town easily. The only odd thing was not having a mini fridge or coffee machine in the room something we've become accustomed to in our travels.
40,Room is fine nothing special. You’re almost guaranteed a decent view though. My only complaint which I’m sure is common is that the pool is only sunny for a couple hours. In this case 2-4pm. It’s a classic location and building I’ll probably be back.
30,We stayed in a suite and was disappointed in the amenities and lack of attention to cleanliness. Bed was comfy and enjoyed the smoke free environment. Elevators were dirty and one even had broken glass in it.
50,Loved my stay there. Will def be back. The staff was super welcoming and I really enjoyed that the hotel is non smoking. Had a small issue with the room which was taken care of right away very late at night. Thank you park mgm!!!
50,Do i need to say more? Rooms are always a vibe as well. Eatily has the best tasting food as well as the other food choices of noodles or the best friends restraunt. The park is the perfect central location and right next to CVS convenience store. I will always come here when I’m on the strip
50,Very nice hotel. The rooms are great. I also appreciate that this is a smoke-free hotel and there is no smoking in the lobby and gaming areas. I was able to Bruno Mars at The Dolby Theater which is located in this hotel. Received great service from the staff each day.
50,The hotel is smoke free . A nice change on the strip for non smokers and people with allergies. Rooms were good. Could hear the neighbors though. Also service in the room was spotty - we didn't get glasses one day and no bathmat one day.
50,We have been to the Park MGM many times the last year and it is by far our favorite hotel in Las Vegas. The rooms are nice hotel is in a great location for everything. We loved the spa restaurants and walked across the street to see George Strait last year. We have been there for super bowl weekend several times. I love the no smoking casino. Just a great place. My favorite!!
40,Overall not a bad hotel to stay at in Vegas. The casino is nonsmoking which is a plus to me. Room was clean and towels fresh with hairdryer and iron provided. Plenty of USB and electrical plugs bedside for charging mobile devices. No in room coffee pot for all you coffee drinkers! Hotel wants you going downstairs for that $10 Starbucks.
20,There were black hairs all over the back wall of our shower. We called housekeeping 6 or 7 times to clean it. 6 or 7 times housekeeping came to our room cleaned it but still left the black hairs in the shower. I finally called the supervisor of housekeeping. She came to the room I showed her the hairs and it was finally taken care of...the night before we left.
10,We arrived just after 11AM and was told that there were no rooms available. I told the gentleman checking us in that I paid for the early check-in/late check-out. I was told that he didn’t see it on the itinerary and that there was nothing we could do. He made no attempts to correct the problem or call a manger until I asked him to do so. I suppose I could take partial blame for this since I didn’t check the itinerary that was emailed to me but I didn’t think I had to since I called in the reservations and confirmed the information when I called back to add an extra day to our stay. We eventually made it to a room.  We went to the store in your lobby to the right of you check-in desk to find a sweater. I asked your clerk Crystal if there was another store in the hotel since I didn’t find anything there. Her response was “yes but it will be $60 $80 or $100”. I am not sure what is was about my appearance that led her to believe that I could not afford that price range but it was insulting. So I purchased what I needed outside of the hotel.  We got ready and headed downstairs to have dinner and pick up the VIP package for the Bruno Mars concert that evening. According to the email I received I was supposed to pick them up at the box office. We were told that the purchase could not be found on our reservation and there were no tickets at will call. We were then sent back and forth between box office VIP desk and to the venue with no success. At his point I was fighting back tears and made the decision to just see concert with out VIP access. Imagine my surprise when I gave the tickets to the attendant and was given my VIP lanyards. I believe your staff should be better trained so that no one else has to endure the stress I did.  Since I was never able to eat we ordered food at the concert we purchased a Mediterranean charcuterie board. We opened the bag of pita bread to find it covered in mold. We showed it to your wait staff she laughed. In her defense she did apologize over and over however it would have seemed more sincere without the laughing.  I would like to point out that the gentleman at the concierge desk was extremely helpful in booking our tickets to the Cirque Du Soleil show O. He was kind and thoughtful and helped me successful book my VIP package there.
50,This is one of the top hotels that we pick when we come to Vegas. We love the location and the fact that it is non smoking really make our stay more enjoyable. It is not a very big hotel therefore don’t feel as crowded.
10,The halls are dark and dingy the room walls are paper thin you can hear everything! It smells like dog poop. The furniture is old and dated pillows are lumpy. We were comped for 4 nights we took off after the first night and paid at another casino  Not a great start to our 16th anniversary getaway.
50,Park MGM is like a mini MGM Grand and it was great rooms were perfect size for me and the food there is great! Definitely eat at the restaurants there….I will be staying there again for sure…staff were great and always greeted you with a smile and said hi to you when they see you
50,My wife and I both found the Park MGM Las Vegas hotel to be clean recently updated and it is in a fantastic location. We plan to stay there again soon when we return for a Golden Knights hockey game (since the arena is right next door to the hotel).
50,Check in was swift and easy. Loved that it was non smoking. The restaurants were real good. I ate at PrimRose Side Betty and of course Eataly. Room was awesome for the price. Also the location of the hotel is centrally located to everything you need.
50,The hotel is great! Loved Eataly so much miss it everyday! There was an amazing employee Hank G. security. He is an asset to the hotel and made us feel welcomed and appreciated. Thank you to Hank and all the wonderful staff members you have at The Park. We will be back!!
50,Smoke free hotel and casino. What more could you ask for!? Loved the Italian market area. Next to T-mobile stadium with a nice out door sitting space/park across the street with lively restaurants that are a nice change of pace from the strip.
50,Park MGM is a very good location on the strip. The hotel is clean and well maintained the casino floor has a high activity level a large selection of slot machines lots of fun. And a friendly bartender staff.
30,Great location and centrally located to other newer MGM properties. Inside the Park MGM is Dolby Live staff and venue is top notch and there are other good venues near by. The restaurants are very good but the rooms are in need of serious refurbishment.
50,Park MGM is one of my favorite properties on the strip. We chose to stay a night as a quick getaway for the weekend and it really couldn't have been a better experience. Our room was superb...just the right level of class and coziness that we felt comfortable. The staff are friendly and helpful. The dining options in Park are top tier and Nomad Bar is easily one of the best in the entire city if you want superior cocktails without (much) pretention. Not to mention being able to walk the casino floor without smelling like I've smoked a pack of cigarettes solo is great too.    If you want to stay on the strip but you don't necessarily want the in-your-face-ness of many of the other properties give Park MGM a look.
50,Nice room  extremely comfortable bed great bartenders and good food options. Staff is friendly and room is nice with a comfy couch to lounge on . The only thing I would see changed is there is no mini refrigerator in the room.
50,Great place to stay. Location is awesome.  Rooms need updating. Good places to eat. Love that it's smoke free would like to see better blackjack odds. Lower table limits during non peak hours. More coffee options
30,Hotel is located in a very convenient location on the strip and has tram service to the Bellagio hotel room decor was ok but had no amenities such as alarm clock or mini fridge or coffee pot. Hallways are extremely dark but smell great
40,Happy with our hotel. Our room was exceptionally clean and amazing. I also like that it's non-smoking. I don't like the hallway. It's dark and creepy. It reminded me of the Shining movie. Need more light. But overall hotel is safe.
40,My husband and I really enjoyed our stay. Out room was very clean and comfortable. Eataly is such a great feature to Park MGM. Having a smoke free casino is nice. More waitresses/waiters needed in casino.
50,Two words….NON-SMOKING! Great restaurants bars comfortable beds great bell service. Best Friend is amazing. Saw Bruno in February and Silk Sonic in August at Dolby Live. Amazing venue. Love this place!
50,Short trip to Vegas to see Bruno Mars!  Concert venue is part of the hotel. Location on the strip is more in the middle still plenty of walking! Hotel was clean. Casino and hotel is smoke free which is a great plus.
50,We had a great time and loved the hotel and clean room! The whole hotel smelled amazing. We signed up to be rewards members and look forward to future savings and discounts. Wish we could have used the pool and hot tub but we arrived too late.
20,The hotel smelled like sewage/gray water. It's clear they're aware of this because they spray an aroma all over the lobby to mask it. Too bad they don't do that for the rooms! If you do stay make sure you get a stay well suite for the aromatherapy you'll need it.
40,The hotel is smoke free; which was great! The Eataly had amazing food! You could eat there your whole trip! The staff was courteous. But the room itself did not meet expectations…very outdated dark table with one chair low soft bed.
50,Excellent hotel recently refurbished and it shows. Room was spacious enough and well furnished. We had a Strip View though you are little away from the Strip it was still nice. Maid service was excellent and room amenities were fine except that there was not coffee pot furnished. We had read other reviews and were aware of this and brought a portable K cup machine though there is a conveniently located Starbucks as you get off the elevator and come into the lobby.  The hotel is in a very good location easy to get anywhere from there. Besides the food options at the hotel there are plenty of restaurants close by. New York Casino is right next door with a lot of food items.  Of course this is a Casino hotel but the gaming area is very good and non smoking as is the Hotel. The dealers were all friendly and knowledgeable and the waitress was always around suppling free drinks. The entire place is very clean and pleasant.
50,"Park MGM previously was the Monte Carlo which had become very tired. MGM dropped a boat load of dough into this and it is a very nice hotel. There are others that are nicer but for the value to cool factor this gets a ""10"". You have access to everything and how much time do you really spend in your room anyway. Great value great casino and close to everything. When I hit it big I may try some other hotel but for now Park MGM for me and my wife."
50,Before booking at this casino there will be a hefty resort fee per day and parking fees if using a car....love the location and non smoking stance.....no food court choices....just a starbucks....just me but I dont like starbucks had to go elsewhere for a morning treat
20,Extra bank hold which was part of our spending money no frig no microwave. Resort fees and the fee is taxed are really a scam. (Did not use. Phone wifi. Gym pool) Halls are so dark and depressing.
50,I would highly recommend Park MGM! Our stay was exceptionally pleasant. From the moment we checked in to the moment we checked out we found staff and services above the norm. Exceptionally clean well maintained rooms were well stocked and the service was 5 star.
50,If you want to see a lot of the strip in a short amount of time I highly recommend staying at park MGM it's center strip so you get all the main sights to see in a short distance great food options all around best friend is definitely top tier coming from a person who cooks food for a living you are absolutely missing out if you don't eat at best friend
50,"Park MGM has become our Home Away from Home. We especially enjoy the smoke-free element of the resort. We look forward to seeing the friendly staff and the personal touch of the team. Grisel De Leon has the personality that keeps us coming back. She is always welcoming brightens up the high limit slot area with her presence creates a personalize connection and has electric smile that will make ""The Park"" the only choice when it comes to our family. A recent experience cemented our commitment to The Park. We had to come to Las Vegas for my Grandfather needing a highly specialized and intense medical procedure. They were nervous about the procedure. We introduced our Grandparents to Grisel. She took time to listen and provided a great smile and shared caring words with them. WOW!!! She created a deeply personal and lasting experience that we will never forget! She is truly an asset to the team!"
10,The place smells like sewage in the hallway and it leaked into our room. I checked out a day early and the front desk said that I would get a refund when Expedia calls the hotel. When Expedia called the hotel they said that my status was still as checked in and I would not receive a refund.
50,Very nice hotel. No smoking allowed made for a very nice experience. Friendly staff. Very close to T-Mobile Arena and Dolby Live theater. If you're going to an event at either location stay here to avoid waiting in the long taxi/rideshare line afterwards. Con: Our room did not have a mini-fridge.
50,Everything was great but I did not like the queen bed that much it was a hard and uncomfortable but I stayed out so didn't sleep much but everything else was OK the food was good in most places it will be great for them to invest in a complimentary breakfast like it is bk home or like the hiltons do
50,Park MGM was THE best hotel I've stayed at in Vegas. The staff were truly nice and accommodating. Originally I was supposed to say for two nights and three days but my flight got cancelled and I had to stay for two more days. I had to check back in. When I arrived back at the hotel security guard named Brian saw distress on my face. He gave me his family and friends discount. Then the front desk employee was very nice and patient with me during the process. The restaurants were great and on top of that everything else was too! I will definitely be staying again at Park MGM.
40,Enjoyed. Loved the NON-SMOKING environment. Really enjoyed the concert in the connecting venue. DJ on the patio at ON THE RECORD after the show was AWESOME ❣️ Danced until 2 AM. Will definitely visit again.
50,Highly recommend. Non-smoking very friendly and helpful staff great massage and spa experience good food good drinks. You really can't go wrong. Our tour left close by and it was very easy to get where we needed to go from the location. But you almost don't need to leave.
40,Staff was friendly . Parking was very easy . Check in and out was very fast . Casino very clean . Love it non smoking casino . Hotel was easy access to the Vegas strip . Good thing there is a tram from the hotel to bellagio
30,The rooms are very disappointing no dressers no tub beds on low plat form almost to the ground. The decor was something my 8 year old daughter would decorate with. For an MGM hotel I was extremely disappointed an I had gone there for years but the remodel was a disaster.  It is a non smoking hotel now  but years a years of being a smoking hotel the rooms an halls smell of stale smoke a wish they would have replaced a removed the smell. Just not the luxury it use to be.
40,Hotel was in a great location. The room was very dusty but a nice size. We experienced the spa and it was amazing. The steam room is a must! Staff overall throughout the hotel was helpful and friendly.
40,This was my first trip to Vegas. We were nit sure where to stay. I am glad after walking around that this was a the hotel we decided on. One of the few with no smoking EVEN in the casino area. Never had to wait to long for anything. If I needed anything or had to ask for service or directions there was always a person willing to help.
10,Park mgm is a nice casino staff provided excellent service food options are good room was clean and the beds were comfortable. The only problem I had at the casino was that I was robbed on the casino floor during morning hours. I sat to play a machine and some guy approached me and asked me to get off the machine. Then when I went to put my $20 in the slot machine he snatched my $20 and ran off. I screamed security and security came after a few minutes to take a written statement. I have never in my life been robbed and to be robbed inside a hotel on a casino floor in public is very disheartening and I feel that casinos really need to do something about the number of homeless people and criminals that enter the casino just to create trouble. It is not fair to people that pay to come to Las Vegas to have a good quality time! I have seen over the years that there has been an increase especially after 2020 in the number of people just loitering around the casino floor. I really do not understand why outside (locals) are allowed in the casino when they are not staying there and the neighborhoods immediately outside of Las Vegas are very sketchy and unsafe. The casinos really need to add more security guards inside and outside of the casino or just close off the casino to people who are not staying at the property!
50,Great. Easy to get too. The room was a little bit smaller than other hotels in Vegas for the money. The resort fee was just another fee. Parking for handicap not well marked. The prices in the store were high much more than Walgreens across the street and the items were not marked.
30,Nice value at park MGM. Plus a non smoking hotel and casino!! Rooms are a bit below average but clean. No dresser/draws for clothes and a very very small closet. You can also hear every word your neighbors say. Good thing we didn’t stay in the room all that much. Check in was probably the best and easiest I’ve had in Vegas yet!
20,We stayed here for the Bruno Mars concert. But there was no nightlife or restaurants open after a certain time. The food that was available reminded of a casino in Laughlin. We had to travel to other hotels to find music/ food/ nightlife etc.
50,Upon visiting Eataly retail area we were greeted by Hank (security). He proceeded to notify us of a wine tasting that was being offered so we decided to partake. His authenticity and welcoming personality added to our wonderful experience. He is security but has a complimentary presence that encompasses his vast knowledge of wine and a stellar personality. Make sure you stop by the Eataly wine retail area and pick up a bottle of wine and get to meet Hank G!
50,The nicely appointed room was perfectly quiet and relaxing. I love the fact that this non-smoking casino is a bit smaller than most on the strip and that the lobby is away from the casino floor hustle and bustle. The rideshare area was very easy to access and all the staff that I dealt with were friendly and courteous. I highly recommend staying here.
30,The hotel service cleanliness and being smoke free were great. The rooms we subpar. The bed was hard and the pillows weren’t great. The rooms were dated. The hallways had really bad carpeting that was green and stained. It looked like there should be outlines of crime seen on the carpeting. The gym didn’t have handles for the cable cross over machine and over crowded. Unless I got free suite here I wouldn’t stay here again.
50,Clean room great staff loved my 4 night stay. Even reasonable table minimums set at 15 on a few tables more of the night than any other hotel...and it being smoke free in the casino was a great plus!
50,We stayed at Park MGM January 20 to January 22. We have stayed there many times and have never been disappointed. The renovated rooms are fine especially the renovated shower. The water pressure is excellent. We gambled some at Park but also used the location to hang out at NYNY and Aria. Check-in was a breeze. My friend was able to send me the code before she got there so I had access to the room at 1:30 PM. We did get key cards because the phone code was hit or miss.    We also enjoyed Eataly and had break at Primrose one morning. The coffee is excellent. We played some at the Center bar and were happy to see a good selection of games at the bar top. We would go back anytime.
50,This was an amazing stay for the Bruno Mars concert. Check-in was swift and we were upgraded to a high level floor away from the elevator. Everything was within walking distance. Eataly is a nice restaurant venue with plenty of options. We were pleasantly surprised by the Korean BBQ. The Salty Dog was amazing. All in all this was one of my best trips to Vegas!
20,I struggled a bit with this review - my rating is based on cost of the hotel and our experience. We were 2 couples 1 in in a king bed room and 1 in a room with 2 beds. I read reviews when I booked and am always wary of all the single review ratings but many Vegas hotels have mixed reviews.    The best thing about this hotel is it's smoke free including the casino. This is the main reason we booked it.    The wi-fi worked great. They provide and iron/ironing board. I didn't use the hair dryer so don't know how well it worked.    We paid for a room with a view of the strip but all we saw was the retail stores across the street.    It's an older property and the bathroom sink is stained and wear and tear is showing. Rooms lacked cleaning - there's a layer of visible stuck-on dust on the grill that heats/cools the room and goodness knows when the carpet was last vacuumed. You have to ask for your room to be cleaned and clean towels (we were here 5 nights) and they left us dirty glasses (pay-back maybe for asking for cleaning). I've not noticed this at other hotels - they don't use fitted sheets on the bed so the bottom sheet moves about (I don't want to see the mattress thank you very much). At this price point I expect more room in the closet.    We wanted breakfast in the dining room one morning and couldn't get a table half empty but evidently all the tables were reserved. We've done our share of travelling and I've never had this happen.    Our room was reasonably quiet. Our friends room had an adjoining door to another room and it was like being in the very same room with your neighbour you can hear every conversation. Noise from the hallway was like that in other hotels.
30,If they will improve the bedroom mattress it would change the character of the hotel. The prime restaurant Primrose should be open normal business hours. The VIP checking should improve on customer service.
50,I loved how clean this casino was. It is completely smoke free and that is amazing. You can sit and play anywhere in the casino and not have smoke in your face. The staff is friendly and helpful. This is my new favorite casino in Vegas! I love the MGM grand too but this MGM Park is better.
40,I went to Vegas to attend Bruno Mars concert and stayed at Park MGM because it was attached to the Dolby Theater. The location was great the amenities were good however the room  was lacking cleanliness (the bedsheets and the pillow case had a visible stain on it and it grossed me out) and the front desk was not very friendly.
50,Very clean Smoke Free Kind courteoushelpful staff. Great restaurants of all kinds Great variety of both slots and table games. I would highly recommend this Hotel/Casino right on the strip in the heart of Las Vegas. You wouldn’t regret it. I have been in ALL of them on the Las Vegas Strip so I can very much say from experience that it is TRULY one of the best
50,We stayed at the Park MGM primarily due to a Bruno Mars concert we were attending. It was a pleasant surprise that the entire resort is smoke free! Room casino Eataly restaurants shops and Dolby Live was clean. Will stay here again!
50,Me and my friends had a great time staying at Park MGM. It was very easy to get access to the others casinos also they have a nice Tram to go to Bellagio for free. The staff are super nice and welcome people!
40,Just getting back from a great stay at Park MGM. We stayed at this hotel while seeing Bruno Mars. The convenience of being able to walk downstairs to the venue was unmatched.    While it’s the tiniest bit dated the hotel is very clean and everyone is very kind! As other reviews have stated the hallways are dark but we found out rooms to be very clean. We upgraded our stay after our first night. Nothing particularly wrong with the first room but we wanted to splurge as it was our first time in Vegas. The transition between rooms was flawless. Front desk staff was very helpful and accommodating. Book the Nighthawk Suite! It is a great space for couples.
50,My wife and I spent the weekend in Las Vegas celebrating our 10 year anniversary! Our experience at the Park MGM was incredible. Really nice rooms great location on the strip and some of the best customer service I’ve seen in years!!! Outstanding experience!
10,Our room was used by someone before we entered. The bed and chairs were messy. Bathroom light was flashing on and off. They changed us to another room. And the new room was stinking with weed and cigarettes. Location and the pictures look good but reality for us based of the room was bad.
10,There are much nicer places to stay on the strip for the same value. I was guaranteed a late check-in and prior to my arrival I called twice to confirm when I was set to arrive and to have them note my estimated check-in time on my guest card. When I arrived they still marked me as a no show and did not have a room available for me. The desk staff acknowledged that it was their fault but did not do anything to remedy the situation aside from offering a more expensive suite (at my own cost). Horrible customer service.
40,Conveniently located on the strip. Easy access to many other major hotels. Toilet (flush wasn't working properly) and bathroom amenities could be better. Not a fan of the dark carpets and walls. Not much external noise except the screaming guests :) Family friendly and good restaurants nearby.
10,My husband and I travel to Vegas several times per year and have stayed at many different properties. This was by far our worst experience. The room was not ready so we could not check in until nearly 4pm causing us to be 30 minutes late for our dinner reservations at Hell’s Kitchen. The staff at check-in was rude and unapologetic demonstrating very poor customer service and no interpersonal skills. The room was small and dirty with a terrible view - although we paid extra for a view room. The hotel was way overpriced. Overall poor experience. We will not stay at this hotel again.
30,Nice hotel but room was still dirty from previous guests. Ordered champagne with 3 glasses they only sent 3. Very confusing set up got lost several times. Easy access to see Bruno Mars. Not enough inductions on how to get there.
50,Spent a weekend buddy trip at the ParkMGM. It was a good value for the room loved the smoke free casino area and like the location of the hotel on the strip. It was too cold to enjoy the pool but the gym and spa are highlights.
40,Very clean property.....staff was pretty friendly except for all the craps dealers. Rooms were pretty good especially for the low price. Good food options throughout. We loved the small size in terms of knowing your way around and not getting lost. However the small size limits the gaming options.
50,Room was clean and loved that it was smoke free. The restaurant was nice. Liked Betty’s restaurant was open late after staying up late. On the record after party was amazing! We had a great stay and looking forward to going back.
40,We are so happy our health doesn’t have to take a hit anymore when we stay in Vegas and that our kids aren’t breathing in toxic secondhand smoke. Major plus! The downside is that the rooms are pretty small and basic.
50,Loved that the hotel is nonsmoking. The staff are friendly and it was an overall great hotel. The Uber pick up is convenient. All of the food that we sampled was exceptional. The only challenge was walking to the monorail. It is a hike.
50,We had a fantastic time in Jan. 2023 staying in a 2 queen bedroom at Park MGM. There were 3 of us in the room and it was a good size for all of us. Love the non-smoking aspect of the hotel/casino. We also love the restaurants at Park MGM. On this trip we ate at Toscana Best Friend Primrose and La La Noodle. All were fantastic and so different. We also stayed at Park MGM in a King room in Oct. 2022 and enjoyed it along with Bavette's and Primrose. Love having Eataly right there as well.
50,Smoke free very clean and a great location. Nice to be able to walk to all mgm resorts or use the free teams that connect them. Would recommend park mgm. Staff friendly and rooms clean and comfortable
50,Very nice property and hotel. Food at Eataly is excellent. If the line at Starbucks is too long(it usually is!) just take the 4 minute walk to NYNY for excellent coffee and breakfast options. Rooms were very comfortable and the location is superb.
30,Older hotel disguised as new. Also they use one ply toilet paper. Gross. There was a smell all throughout the casino level and our floor (third floor). I did like the check in process though. We only stayed there because the concert we were seeing was there.
10,We arrived to the hotel around 11pm and found blood on our bed sheets upon check-in. I immediately called the front desk and asked for our bed to be changed. Housekeeping never showed up and we fell asleep on the couch waiting. I went to the front desk the next morning and was assured our bed would be changed immediately. We left to a wedding returned to our room that night to find that our room was cleaned but the sheets were still not changed! My husband and I slept on the couch again as a result of this. Absolutely unacceptable.
10,"Unfortunately our first room smelled like sewage. The second room was an ""upgrade"" but not really as the shower would not drain. Also the hotel would randomly smell like sewage throughout the day.    The beds are very low as a 6""3' man they barely reached my shins... and were extremely hard and uncomfortable. Definitely not the pillowtop we were told would be in our room."
30,Staff was friendly and helpful and I loved that it is a smoke free facility even in the casino. The common areas at ground level are beautiful.    Location was difficult. We stayed here while attending the LVCC and it was not convenient to the monorail. However the buses do pick up and drop off right out front. There is also a free tram available (accessed from Aria) to take one to the Bellagio should he/she wish to get farther up north a little quicker.    Our biggest “area of opportunity” was the rooms. Our whole company stayed in different rooms here and all had the same feedback: the walls are thin the beds hard and the sheets scratchy. That being said if your intent is to party hard and you only need a place to lay down for the night the price for these rooms probably can’t be beat on the Strip. Nothing fancy but they certainly serve their purpose.
50,Very well kept cleanness overall rooms are very spacious especially the room connections are also very convenient if you are traveling with a group of friends. Definitely one of my favorite places to stay.
50,Came with some friends to see Bruno Mars. Staff was super friendly and nice location of concert was so close to the hotel rooms. It was a great place highly recommend! Clean cute the experience was awesome!
40,Great stay. Friendly staff. Great location and great room layout. View was wonderful! Small casino but love smoke free! Everyone on the staff was friendly. Events were well coordinated and easy to enjoy.
50,from check in to check out a great experience. Great service at check in and easy access via cab to the entire strip - great experience. I will be back for sure. I was on business for this trip but would not hesitate to bring my other half
50,The front desk forgot about us he stated he would call us when our room was ready. Needless to say we went to the front desk and ask about the room the clerk stated I’m so sorry I been so busy. The employee that really brightened our day was Jasper he asked what brought us to Vegas. I told him I just retired from 30 years of service he said that was really great Jasper returned with a bottle of champagne for the wife/I to celebrate with really nice of him. I can say Jasper is a very special guy to have went out of his way to acknowledge my retirement. The customer service is very good at the Nomad we always stayed in Park MGM from now the hotel for us is Nomad thank Jasper
50,Great value casino food & entertainment. Feels new with their remodel. However they had to do it in a dated building so things like the rooms feel a little cramped. The design and what they do with that space is impressive though. Love the food options and most places feel very clean. The elevators need better cleaning and care. Also their mattresses are not good. We've stayed here a number of times and sometimes we get mattresses that have huge sinkholes in them. They are more memory-foam types so they can get really hot as well. The pool is our favorite because it is very chill in the early part of the day and gets upbeat and fun in the later afternoons.
40,We really enjoyed ourselves and hotel staff was really nice. The food was very good. I almost fell but manager on duty at the restaurant made sure that I was OK and he comp us a meal worth $50 Hotel security presence is seen and very appreciated.
50,Always a great time at the MGM Properties and we especially love the Park MGM and Aria for location dining and the casinos at both are perfect size without and easy to move around. Short walk between these casinos without having to go outside and the tram will take you up to Bellagio another MGM property where you can shop and enjoy.
20,Water turned off at 1:00 - 5:00AM Thursday morning and not allowing me to shower before my flight home at 6:11AM. Waited 30 minutes for help with my luggage from the Bell stand. Again no warning on Wednesday that the water would be turned off to make other arrangements. Until I arrived back in my room at 9:45 Wednesday night. I should have been told this was happening when I checked in. No offer to reduce my rate as they did not care.
40,We booked the package for the Bruno Mars concert which was AMAZING!!! Our seats were great and I'm looking forward to the next concert there.    Loved that it's non-smoking and Eataly offers so many delicious options. Plus it's connected to Aria so there are even more dining choices.
10,The rooms are very much outdated. Whole lobby when you came into. The front area. Smelled like sewer. There was also not enough coffee in any rooms. You had to go down and wait in the line to get just to get coffee in the morning at Starbucks. And the line was 100 deep.
40,Pretty good location and it’sNON-SMOKING! What an oasis in Vegas! He really is a fantastic restaurant facility that’s like a market place at the ground level. Great food fun atmosphere and a terrific little wine shop.
50,My wife and I stayed at Park MGM to go the Adel Concert. The Park was at perfect location to walk. At the same time we were able to stay within the Park since it was free smoking hotel. Park had a good selection of food and were able to gamble since it had a good selection of slots and tables.
50,I’ve stayed at Park MGM several times. They have great dining choices and entertainment. The location is good with walking distance to other great places to see. Overall this hotel has been a great stay every time.
50,Love staying at Park MGM. Rooms are spacious and clean. Casino clean and lively and the food options are delicious. perfect location on strip and so easy to Uber to and from. Park MGM has become our new home in Sin City.
50,Writing specifically about my favorite dealer at the table games there at the Park MGM Rosemary.    I had the pleasure of playing a few hands with her recently. I must say Rosemary truly stands out from other dealers I've encountered. From the moment I sat down at the table she made me feel welcome and at ease.    Rosemary was not only knowledgeable about the game of blackjack but she was also informative and helpful taking the time to explain the rules and offering tips on strategy. Her friendly and approachable demeanor put me at ease even during the more intense moments of the game. She was also incredibly kind always quick with a smile or a word of encouragement when things weren't going my way.    In a game that can be tough to handle the emotional swings Rosemary was a breath of fresh air. She made the experience enjoyable and fun even when I was on a losing streak. Her positive attitude and upbeat personality helped to keep the mood light making it a great time for everyone at the table.    I truly appreciate Rosemary and the great experience she brought to the table. I know that she brings a lot of happy guests great experiences and I would highly recommend her to anyone looking for a top-notch blackjack dealer. She is a true asset to the Park MGM and a shining example of what a great casino dealer should be. If you're looking for a fun and engaging game of blackjack be sure to ask for Rosemary at the Park MGM.
20,Such a disappointment The room was not up to par it look like it needs to be renovated or something I was not impressed at all I couldn't believe that they didn't have a coffee pot in the room it would've been nice if they could provide more
10,First day and a half the air conditioner was broken so they gave us $50 food and beverage. Next day Tv was not working. Stayed a total of 7 days and left with over 20 bed bug bites all over!!! Contacted hotel and no response!! The Park was our go-to hotel!! Never staying there again!
40,Small rooms for the strip but incrediblely welcoming incredible hospitality and maybe the cleanest property I’ve stayed at on the strip.  Would I stay again yes due to cleanliness hospitality and general ease of operating the property.
50,Great place to stay in Las Vegas strip  Smells great service is amazing rooms are clean and views are beautiful. Love that is right next to T-Mobile arena for any event. Great if you’re taking kids to stay here it’s a no smoking so it smells great.
50,NO SMOKING casino and hotel. Good restaurant selections especially BAVETTES Steakhouse Great steaks and sides great service and great atmosphere  Great location especially if you like to walk the Strip and visit other hotels and casinos  Attached to Dolby Theater so you can score cheap tickets by waiting to last minute  We got Bruno Mars center stage 7th row for $300 each
30,Although there were minor issues with the room Park MGM is still our preferred hotel stay due to the non-smoking environment and location. The convenience of the property to other hotels is outstanding.
30,I expected Park MGM to be a better hotel. The hallway was dark the carpet was stained in the hallway and there was trash in the hallway on more than one occasion. The room was just average and the shower didn’t get hot (the hottest it ever got was lukewarm). It’s not the worst hotel but I really only recommend staying there if you are going to see a performance at Dolby Live (so only stay for the convenience of having access to your concert venue). Other than that there are better hotels in the area than this one.
50,We were very happy with our stay. The suite was spotless and the beds were comfortable. Online check in was so easy. The rest of the resort is very well maintained and the staff is friendly. Also very nice that it is a non smoking facility. We visited other more expensive hotels and they were not as clean and smelled like smoke.
30,Staff needs to be in a better mood but beds and shower were awesome!  The new Park MGM is definitely a plus up from the old Monte Carlo but the $39 + Tax “Resort Fee” PER DAY is a ridiculous useless extortion.
50,We came to Las Vegas for a business convention and the Park MGM was the hotel selected for the convention. We were super impressed with the hotel. We especially appreciated that it is a smoke free environment. The staff were very friendly. The staff that served our meals at our conference were so hospitable and the meals were great! We were very comfortable in our room. There were a lot of places to eat without having to leave the hotel. We definitely would stay again! This is a high class hotel for a reasonable rate!
50,Concierge decorated our room for a bday surprise better than I could have even asked for. Then when housekeeping came in to clean the room they saw the balloons and banner and gave some snacks with a sweet bday note!! Great service!!
50,The location was good for myself and family services when used were good as well. All employees that I encountered were exceptionally friendly and courteous. The Bruno Mars concert was outstanding. When transportation was needed we never had to wait long for pickup or drop off. The only thing that would have made te trip better would have been winning in the casino!
40,Great location and smoke free!  Staff very friendly and very good food in the restaurants.  I was surprised that there was no mini fridge in the rooms for left overs and no coffee makers and coffee. Wasted lots of food. I would think “resort fees” would include amenities in our rooms.
30,I’ve struggled for years with the ridiculous resort fees charged in Vegas. But I really struggle with the fee when the pools aren’t even open AND I’m charged a hefty parking fee as well. I get charging the LA crowd to park but why a paying hotel customer?
30,My room was great. City view of the arena next door. Very calming well decorated was very comfortable to stay in. No signs at all this was the old Monte Carlo hotel which I also stayed out years ago.    ATM's charge you 9.5% fee; The sportsbook drinks are $18 for whiskey & coke; Resort fee is $40 w/tax even on a dead Monday night (I suggested MGM should only charge during Summer & prime periods); I asked for a Woodford Bourbon drink while playing a $25 table and was told only Jim Beam is available (low grade vs. high grade for those not familiar w/bourbons).    Overall I'd stay here again but play elsewhere.
50,The Park MGM has become my favorite hotel on the Strip - the rooms are affordable compared to some of the strip locations. The staff and employees were all incredibly helpful and friendly and I felt welcomed during my stay. I appreciate that the Park MGM is fairly centrally located on the Strip and is connected to Bellagio via Tram but also has easy Strip access for walking. I appreciate all the food options especially Eataly up front in the resort. The options there were wonderful! I really enjoyed my stay and look forward to returning!
50,If you want a budget friendly hotel right on the strip this is it. We enjoyed every moment. The food was great the location was great and an added bonus Bruno Mars was performing at our hotel. I'd definitely stay again.
40,This was my first time in Vegas with my grandma. Overall the stay was great. Park MGM is very close to all the surrounding hotels and places to get food from. The room was very clean and signs are very clear so you cannot get lost.
50,Great location. Nice room. A bit noisy use closeness to the stadium. Could hear crowd yelling. Good restaurants. The concierge was not very helpful or the least bit friendly. Small lobby area without any place to sit down. Overall I would stay again.
30,We stayed at the Park for a week & have stayed there every year since the change. It's always been a good place to stay not anymore. We came back from a show at 10:00 pm to find a stranger in our room repairing a light fixture. It was frightening to find someone in our room No one told us about this.
30,Sewage and draining problems in our room. We had to shower in ankle deep of our own dirty water for 3 days because drainage was clogged and did not flow properly. Very inconvenient when you are trying to shower and get ready. This delayed us to our main event.
30,We like the Parks boutique feeling. Staff is nice views are great spa-not a favorite. Make sure you dont have adjacent rooms.... you can hear everything next door. Convenient location if the show is in the hotel.
40,If you’re going to a show at the Dolby theater this is the best place to stay. It’s an elevator ride down to the theater plus it’s smoke free. You also have access to some amazing food & it’s a short walk or tram ride to the shops. They have a great spa as well if you want to relax. The only down side are the rooms. The bathroom showers weren’t very clean & the room was small. Also the hallway leading up to the room was dark & creepy.
20,Room was very dark. Was surprised to pay so much nightly and have no fridge or even a coffee maker included in the rate. I would not choose to stay here again. The only part I liked was that the property was smoke-free.
20,Checked in and found a half used bottle of lotion just sitting on the shelf along with other soap and towels. Skeptical of how through the room is being clean for the next guest. The hallway to the rooms are dim and scary i would totally turned around if im traveling alone. Very dissapointed in the quality of this MGM property and the additional resort fee and parking fee we are paying for this hotel
30,I bought the Bruno Mars package and due to availability was placed at the Park. I knew the King room would be small but it's not laid out very well. There's a single door for the closet and bathroom that's just ridiculous! Open the door coming out the bath and hit someone in the face standing in the closet. No fridge. No coffee maker. The reservations for the package needed two.more separate reservations for the days I added before and after the concert. None of the reservations matched in the app and we're a pain to manage. There has to be something better out there.
50,This was my birthday solo trip. I thoroughly enjoyed myself. The staff was exceptionally friendly the food was delicious and the hotel was beautiful. Not to mention the MGM rewards I received and could use for food and the casino.
40,We stayed here when it was the Monte Carlo and it still is a nice hotel. We were here for a concert at this hotel and that made it easy and convenient. The room was nice and clean and very comfortable.    The restaurant choices here are ok very expensive and the food is just ok.    Location is a little off the strip but close enough so you can walk. If you're going to a concert here it is the best place to stay!
30,Chose to stay here because hotel is connected to the Dolby Live Theater. Being January we couldn't use the pool area anyway but what a disappointment to find out that the fabulous pool area when the hotel was the Monte Carlo is gone. If you aren't into gambling there is nothing to do at this hotel. At the same time MGM has worked very hard to keep you at one of their properties the entire stay. You can charge to your room at virtually any of their resorts. Their Eataly food court is outrageously overpriced and service was not very good.
20,The rooms needs updating. The hotel rooms are not worth the cost. They charge a resort fee and they charge for WiFi. Not sure what the resort fee is for. The hallway was dark dark carpe with no decor. I guess the intent is to give you awful rooms so that you spend time in the casino. There were splatters on the bathroom door and the sleeper sofa had stains. I told the lady at the front desk about my concerns however they were never remedied. Will not stay again and I do not recommend.
40,Love the location and all the staff was super friendly. We love the smoke free casino and rooms but beds were not great. The only thing that would have made it better was better mattresses we even changed rooms because of the poor condition of beds in first room. They moved us to the stay well rooms which were slightly better but very firm so not that comfortable.
50,I’ve stayed at Park MGM in the past and everything seems to be more improved. Everyone working there was very friendly and helpful and the location is perfect. I have more trips planned there this year and I will definitely be staying there again.
30,Good location:  Next to Aria that you could take tram to Bellagio.  Rental car service - Avis just in the lobby beside bell desk.    Hotel & Room:  Hallway is dark and dirty.  Shower was clogged in our room. Switched to another room which was dirtier. The towels and pillow cases or whatever were in white are not in white. U could see dirt & stains.  Walls are thin. We could hear snoring coughing showering talking early morning & after midnight til 4am.
50,Great access to the Bruno Mars show! Nice range of prices on food selections. Our favorite food stop was Eataly! So many options to pick from! You really need to take a few minutes to look at all they have to offer. Plus this is a great location!
20,We have visited Vegas at least 2 dozen times. We stayed at the Park MGM because of the Bruno Mars concert. The hotel carpet was dirty rooms looked old and our initial room did not have a walk in shower.
40,Love this place and the hubby is fond of estala! FD staff was very helpful. I didn’t get the name but she was able to assist with my room reservation by adjusting the price for me. Wie will be going back again for sure but if the price is right 😆.
50,Everything was nice and clean. All the staffs help with checking in fast and where polite. The room service was nice as well to. The service and the food was good to and everything stays open late incase you want some.
50,Chose this hotel because it was non smoking. Came with 2 friends and we loved it. The open eataly market was our favorite part with fresh food and good smells every time we were down stairs. The staff was friendly from check in to check out. We used the MGM app for digital key which was nice to skip the line.
10,The overall app is horrible. The price rigging and gouging is horrible. The ONLY WAIVE resort fee if you come to the desk! How is that an added feature. Digital keys seldomly work on MGM properties. Now they are in the news for rigging prices.... MGM sucks overall with their scams.
50,First of all the entire property is smoke-free! We ate at Bavette’s The Library and Primrose restaurants. All were outstanding. All of the employees we encountered gave excellent customer service. The rooms have everything you need. The location is outstanding to get to other casinos. For future trips to Vegas this is the only hotel we will book.
50,A Trip to Las Vegas Staying at the Beautiful Park MGM is a lifetime experience. The casino experience was absolutely enticing specially playing at the High Limit Lounge. It was really a beautiful experience all the way thru. The foods were spendid. Eating at the EATALY Market was an experience that can not be forgotten. The pace is central location to all the surrounding casinos a very short walk to all the venues you want to see and experience.
50,The hotel was very clean and comfy. The whole hotel smelled amazing even in the casino. The location and restaurants were great and we would definitely stay here again. I had an issue with my card not working in the parking garage so I had to pay for my parking even though I’m at pearl status and get free parking and the hotel was willing to correct the issue after the fact. Top notch service at this hotel.
50,I would return to the park MGM the staff was very helpful we all of our needs. Great places to eat in within walking distance to just about anywhere you wanted to go. You do not need to leave the hotel to get to the Dolby theater if you’re going to a concert.
40,Our trip was based mostly on attending the Bruno Mars show at the Dolby theater. The show was awesome and the accommodations were good. It was nice that it was a non smoking hotel and a less busy and glitzy than the MGM grand. It was our first trip in 9 years and we were also celebrating our retirement. We were cautious with all that had happened with COVID and it was fine.
20,After staying here and not having a great experience the first time I decided to give Park MGM a 2nd chance and book a stay well room. This experience was not much different than the first: very thin walls uncomfortable beds and humid rooms.
50,I came to Vegas to gamble and see my 1st Circa Soleil show. And I had a great time. Met a nice couple from Colorado at hotel bar on my first day. The weather was cooler but I prepared for it. I enjoy wearing joggers and sneakers.
50,The fact that it was a smoke free casino helps out a lot due to my asthma so when I walked to other casinos and came back here it felt like a breath like of fresh air to me. On top of that the rooms were clean and they had very friendly hotel staff. I’ve stayed here twice already and I know for a fact I’ll be coming back again along with recommending it to others friends.
50,Our experience at Park MGM was exceptional. Service is outstanding and we especially love the amazing concerts at the Dolby live theater and the wonderful restaurants at this property. We stay here every time we come to Las Vegas and have never been disappointed..
50,At the nicer end of The Strip this hotel is smoke free and houses the Dolby Live Theatre. All of the staff here are so friendly and the hotel is close to many things. Eataly is in the lobby which houses many Italian places to eat with wonderful options.
50,You will be treated like royalty! From the moment you make your reservation to check out & adventures end you will be wowed! Friendly professional helpful staff safe clean & quiet guest rooms! The property is entirely smoke free! No better theatre than the Dolby. An experience to remember & repeat!
50,Always stay here. No smoking excellent staff. Easy to get in and out and convenient to walk to other casinos. Always room to play at the tables and the comps are great. Reward program makes it easy to return.
50,Friendly helpful staff. Great restaurants. Dolby theatre is great for events. Rooms are clean quiet and comfortable. Location is fantastic on the strip. Close to all shows and restaurants with a convenient free tram from the Park MGM to Aria / Crystal shops and to Bellagio. MGM points and discounts for all MGM hotels and restaurants.
50,Really nice to have an all smoke free location. Rooms are no frills but they do supply you with all the necessities. The casino is pretty limited with how many slots they have. Really great location for Dolby live theater as it is at the hotel.
40,Nice non-smoking casino. Wish they had a poker room. Easy to catch a tram to the Bellagio. Strip access is easy. Eataly (sp) was a nice place for a quick meal. Denny's is across the street for a good breakfast and the restaurant next to the Sports Book is a good place for breakfast.
40,The casino is awesome smoke free and lots of places to eat. The rooms are ok I found them to be dirty The walls were dusty. Overall 7/10. great location best friend and lala noodles are a must try....
40,Good location easy to navigate. Staff members are nice and professional. Old rooms with patchy renovation. Room was noisy all sounds from your neighbor come thru the wall. Cheap super low quality shampoo and lotion. No hair dryer it slippers.
30,Room would have been nicer if it was cleaned and maintained properly. Peeling wallpaper dried urine around base of toilet shower door didn’t close properly so water was all over floor sink was filthy and carpet edges were a different color from dust that hadn’t been vacuumed in quite some time
40,Rooms aren’t particularly luxurious but they’re quiet and clean the beds comfy. Love the location. Eataly is a plus too. Nice open casino floor. Digital room keys sound great but we had issues with them and had to get regular keys.
20,This is our 5th trip. We last came 2019. Prices have more than doubled. 11usd for a can of bud if not gambling. Spent 3000usd in 4 days all in MGM casinos. Checked out with a 540usd food bill and got 0. Apparently we didn't gamble enough. This will be our last trip. Atlantic city or lake tahoe next time. MGM is killing itself. Give them 3 to 5 years at this rate. Had fun and didn't mind losing but have been nice to feel appreciated upon check out.  Our friends in the NYNY had theor whole bill compped so the smug little host manager in the park is just trying to tick boxes and get a feather in his cap. We were a group of 8 and around 20 last time so thats a fair bit of revenue you just lost. I hope it was worth it.
50,Pleasantly enjoyed the Park MGM hotel. The make over really made a difference on this trip.  The room were updated: shower nicely done with a low curb instead of a high bathtub. The bedroom was spacious with a modern feel.  My favorite was the food court. It's open with food stations: deli and drink market wine bar seafood bar pizza pasta hot sandwiches and grilled beef. Felt like a picnic in NAPA valley with good food good wine and friends enjoying a good time. There's an array of tables in an open setting to choose. All constantly monitored and wiped/kept clean.
20,Went jan 2023. Stayed at Park MGM and used park nyny and Excaliber casinos. Had fun and spent 3000usd in 4 days. Upon checkout room charge bill for food and drinks was 540usd. Comps nil. Full bill charged. Didnt gamble enough apparently. 11usd for a bottle of but if you're not gambling. Everything is at least double what it was pre covid if not more. With casinos being so tight with comps I think rumour will spread and they are killing themselves. Plenty of other venues in usa to visit. Our 5th and last ever trip to vegas. Bring plenty of money and have fun.
10,The only nice part is it’s non-smoking. Otherwise this hotel is dirty and falling apart. We had to me moved and our second room was also broken in a different way and still dirty. It was a horrible stay and I’ll never stay there again.
30,I had room for four nights so upgraded to a suite for my 70th birthday. Check in was told they don't have any suites available. was told to read the fine print that says if available you can upgrade. The hotel was where the Monte Carlo casino was. The Park only four or five years old. They have many eaterys mostly Italian. Casino located next to New York. Still a very nice hotel. Stan H.
50,We had a great time.we we're getting away from home to see our grandson. the room was clean and staff incredibly friendly.The food at primrose is exceptional and service was always friendly and fast.the non smoking was the best part.
50,Best hotel in the strip in my honest opinion. There are a lot of restaurant to choose from and it is in the middle of the strip. The hotel is clean and it smells great due to non smoking environment. I will recommend this hotel to everyone and Ithis will be my number one hotel choice.
10,Worst day of our life when we visited Park MGM. Never ever go with your family they will treat you bad. No human value. Left the hotel with heavy heart. I will never recommend this place for anyone. Worst place to stay.
50,We loved this hotel because it was a smoke free resort and it was really clean.We had a really good experience here and it was a great location for us we were close to every thing we needed! Highly recommended!
50,It was a delight to stay on this gorgeous nonsmoking hotel. I was able to gamble at the slots without inhaling cigarette smoke all day and night! This is the best casino and the hotel rooms are gorgeous. I didn’t win much money but I had a great time in this casino with all the latest slots available.
50,We stayed for 4 days here in January and it was a very pleasant experience. Staff were always very courteous in explaining any questions we had and helpful with issues we ran in to. Our car battery died at one point in the parking garage and the staff kindly jumpstarted our car for us within minutes of us asking! Rooms were comfy although the pillows are very dense and fluffy so you might want to bring your own pillow if you prefer something a bit smaller/shorter for your neck. Overall room experience was good but the bathroom was not as clean as we would've liked upon check-in. We also experienced wifi and TV connection issues here and there. Casino and common areas were very clean. So glad to have stayed in a hotel that's smoke-free; it makes a huge difference to the air quality! Food at the Primrose was delicious and the portions are fairly large for the price. Eataly also has lots of great selections but I recommend looking at a menu prior to going as it can get a bit crowded. We really enjoyed being centrally located on the strip parking was easy and loved the tram access to Aria and Bellagio at the hotel. Would definitely stay here again.
40,Basic amenities like mini-fridge and coffee pot were not included. Careful don't pick up a water or chips and examine them for content as the minute you pick it up you bought it! Electronically censored. You then have to call front desk to take the charge off.
50,Hank Graae was a pleasure. He helped us no questions asked and gave us great advice on dinner and it was amazing. Will definitely come back for the great service we received! Also the eatery had such amazing food
50,Eataly is one of the best restaurants I've ever eaten at. Bar staff in friendly and make great drinks. Rooms are clean shower is fabulous. I would definitely stay there again in the near future. Mmmmmmm
50,It's nice and friendly and relaxing Trip and staff are friendly and helpful to and well enjoy eating and watching shows in Las Vegas and it's so nice is non-smoking place in Park MGM so clothes don't smell like cigarettes.
40,Its was our first trip to Vegas and I was very skeptical about the hotels on the strip but Park MGM all odds and made our visit a treat to stay there. Its the only nonsmoking casino and hotel. The staff are super friendly and helpful. The check in experience was pretty decent. The location on the strip of the hotel is its best feature and not many mention. It is towards the north end of the strip closer to MGM Grand NYNY on the north side and to Shops at Crystal (Mall) and Bellagio on the south side. There's a free indoor tram that connect the Shops at Crystal and Bellagio through this hotel.  It is considerably smaller than other hotels on the strip so pretty accessible.  Food options are limited and pricey pretty much like any other eateries in any other casino.  We usually ate out. There's no coffee machine or any amenities in the rooms.  The only thing is you have to cross the casino floor to get to any eateries or go back to the elevators to guest rooms - a minor inconvenience in my opinion.  There's a pedestrian bridge right outside the Eataly doors and so is the bus stand for the public bus called Deutsche. We got a day pass for $8 USD each to go up and down the strip which was well worth it. The buss pass could be used through out the city as well so we went once to the outlet shopping centre and once to the rent a car at the airport too.
50,This hotel is perfectly located has some awesome restaurants service was fantastic. I would highly recommend this to friends and family no smoking in the casino no smoking anywhere in the hotel the only one on the strip in all of Vegas for that fact.
40,Room was outdated had to pay to sit in sport book felt like they were making you pay for everything and prices were very high $10 for a beer is crazy. Also all restaurants during playoffs had a minimum food and beverage amount to get a seat
50,I had such a great experience at Park MGM!! The staff members were positive and helpful! The hotel is a smoke free casino and has an amazing clean smell the second you walk in. All the food options and shops and bars in this hotel are such a plus! ( highly recommend primrose for brunch!) I can not wait to go back to this hotel!
50,This is my second visit to this hotel in the past 7 months. I love Park! The rooms even the comp rooms are large comfortable and clean. The hotel is smoke free which is a plus for me and has plenty of food options I enjoy. It's large but not massive which means it's easy to navigate. Whenever I've had an issue which is inevitable it's handled. I visit Vegas often for both business and pleasure and this will likely be a staple hotel for me. It's my favorite and I've stayed here twice MGM Grand Mirage Planet Hollywood and the HIlton Vacation Hotel at the end of the strip.
50,Best hotel on The Strip. Love Eataly on premises. Friendly staff fun casino great restaurant options super comfy beds excellent location. Didn't win my millions but had fun trying. Definitely Recommend!
50,I stay here most of the time when I come to Vegas. I love that this a non smoking hotel and casino. Even though I had an issue this time around this was the first time and it was resolved. I will stay here again. The location is fantastic.
40,Did a staycation with family. Was nice that the hotel is smoke free. Clean rooms  great location and excellent value. Great eats at Eataly and many options at the Park . Las Vegas Golden Knights play home games next door. Buzzkill was the resort fee of $45.
50,The Park MGM met my expectations and more. A great location next to T-Mobile Arena and Toshiba Plaza. My room was awesome the casino was fun and Eataly was much better than I expected (much more than just a food court). Staff was super.
50,Amazing location. The free tram in the back was super beneficial! Great food selection especially Eataly! Rooms were comfy. We stayed in the standard room with two queen beds for 3 people. I would stay here again!
40,Good location food was very good we had a great breakfast the rooms are outdated color scheme is terrible but overall we had a good time location is great you can walk to all the hot spots no need for a uber.
30,Have stayed there before and it was a nice clean smoke free facility. This time room had issues; mattress was sagging there was no hot water In bathroom sink faucet and there was loud noise in room corridor at 3-4am. Place is starting to show its age. Hope management cleans up the place and keeps up with required upgrades.
10,While I appreciated that this hotel is non-smoking (what a bonus in Vegas) the rooms are utterly uninspiring. The room carpet - awful. The dark green hallway motifs - unpleasant dark dank.. It's SO NOISY. And the rooms - the beds are uncomfortable the pillows are sub-par and there are NO amenities in the room - no coffee maker no fridge just a small set of drawers in the closet! Not what is expected. I will compliment the wonderful housekeeping staff. And the shower was great.
10,The room I booked was not available when I checked in. The front desk person didn’t even care. The rooms were filthy dark dingy lacked amenities and did not truly give me the view of the strip. I will not be staying here again.
50,The Park MGM is a great place to stay to wine and dine or just relax. The smoke free environment was awesome and greatly appreciated. The air inside the entire hotel and casino was fresh. All the staff was friendly and helpful.
50,Beautiful hotel with amazing restaurants on Vegas Strip. 100% smoke free which was a breath of fresh air (pun intended) after walking through dozens of other casinos. It's the only hotel I would ever stay in again.
10,The hotel rooms were dirty the sink wasn’t draining and the towels smelled horrible!!! Don’t even mention the check in process that was a headache to just work out.    I don’t think I’ll ever be back again.
10,Dirtiest room I’ve ever stayed in in Las Vegas. I will not stay here ever again. I had switched out of two previous rooms and finally cleaned the 3rd room and shower on my own. Disappointed to say the least.
20,I appreciated that it’s a non smoking hotel but that’s about it.  Apart from that the hotel is dirty carpets on the floor are aged and smelly visibly dirty.    Although the hotel is non smoking there’s a smell in the room. Carpet was dusty could clearly see where they didn’t hoover bathroom was dirty (finger marks along the door) and could go on. Walls are extremely thin I was woken many times by neighbours pulling down their blinds their Tv music and so on.    Definitely not a 4* experience and would never visit again.
30,This was the first time we’ve stayed at the Park and probably our last. Dirty carpets & elevators. Rooms were nice size quiet beds were comfortable but just bland and dated. Casino is nice- busy when events are over at the Dolby next door.
20,Was hoping for better outcome and experience but I’ve stayed at other hotels for less money and yet better quality and experience. Location was probably the only positive factor I’m not one to complain about stuff like this but when I say I think it’s a must for the heater to work especially on a very cold night then that’s a reason for my bad experience/review.
20,Walls are super thin and the room is very basic… there’s basically a bed 2 chairs a table tv and some towels/soap. Thats pretty much it. You can request to have a fridge. But no coffee maker and no space for clothes other than couple of shelves in closet. Looks like a dorm room.
50,Park MGM is always our go to hotel for when we visit Vegas. It’s reasonably priced and smoke free. Eataly has a great selection of foods and Lala Noodle was delicious. We will be staying at this hotel in the near future.
50,Our favorite hotel in Vegas! Great location food and service. We love the casino and restaurant offerings. The staff is very friendly and polite. Interactions with VIP front desk and housekeeping was great! We will be back.
50,Loved the non smoking EVERYWHERE! Would have liked to have a coffeemaker/mini fridge/micro in room. Apparently there isn’t any in any room! Tempurpedic mattress was rather hard but the quiet in the rooms was great. Never heard a neighbor (except rude door slams!) Beautiful view of the snow covered mountains. Air Purifier was wonderful as well the water pressure for the showers! Not sure the Vit C infused shower was really working but it looked cool. Staff was great. Restaurants amazing within the property. You prolly don’t ever have to leave!
40,Enjoyed the location of the hotel and the fact the casino is non-smoking. Love Eately and other restaurants. The building itself is showing its age in the rooms and needs more updates/paint/repairs. Didn’t like that we would have to pay extra for a mini fridge to keep water in. The music playing all day at T-Mobile arena was loud.
10,Visited for business so it wasn’t my choice (I’m probably  Spoiled by my usual accommodations at the Wynn Palazzo and Aria)……Late check in Average room average mattress average location boring casino.
30,Rooms are good but carpets and beds are very old and overused. Its is a pretty basic hotel if you want to just come to relax in room. Not for family wanted to spend time relaxing in room. No coffee maker in room. No extra hand lotion soaps
50,I stayed at the Park MGM while in town for a conference. I was quite happy that the property was completely smoke free. It was quite noticeable and made my stay very pleasant. I also found the Italian market very convenient and the food tasty. The location was easily walkable to the conference center at the MGM.
40,Flew into Fabulous Las Vegas on a Tuesday and spent 3 days relaxing gambling shopping and squeezing in a round of golf with friends before returning home on Friday. Flights seem to be back on time but plan to spend at least 30 minutes to an hour to get thru security unless you are pre-screened and have a known traveler number (KTN). Rental cars average about $100 bucks a day in 2023 and a king-bed room will run you about $300 dollars a night during the week including resort fees and taxes. The online check-in at the Park MGM allows you skip the front desk and use your cell phone as your digital key for room access elevators and self-parking. We found the Park MGM and their partners (listed on their website) to be exceptionally welcoming and friendly and the common areas and restrooms are clean and are well maintained. The High Roller Ferris Wheel on the east side of the strip across from Cesar’s Palace behind the Linq was 30 minutes of fun and offers fabulous views of the Vegas Strip the airport and surrounding mountains. We discovered that food prices along the strip in the casinos have skyrocketed at about double of last year’s inflation rate of 9%. Having visited Vegas at least once a year over the past 20 years before Covid in 2020-21 it’s good to see people out and about having some fun again. Should a trip to this unique desert playground be in your future plan to spend about twice what it used to cost (from $200-$300 per day to about $500 a day now) to vacation in a 4 star hotel/resort on the strip.
30,Confirm room appearances and size before finalizing booking. Pictures did not match what we booked. Location was perfect though if going to T-mobile arena. The staff salvaged the experience. They were very helpful and went above and beyond to fix all issues we had
50,Well placed to all other casino and excellent services!    All restaurants are beyond what you requested and the cleanness visibly appreciated!    Kudos to the staff! We had an incident and the staff came to support us and help us … tks PalmMGM VIP staff!
50,Very comfortable room comfortable casino good location centralized good food walk anywhere to any direction excellent distance to T-MOBILE and ARIA. Excellent room rate and resort fee through MLIFE
50,Located near to tons of restaurants and shops this hotel/casino is perfect for foodies shoppers and gamblers! La la noodle was a favorite! The Mongolian beef and Singapore noodle were heavenly. Primrose was perfect for a satisfying breakfast or lunch..both served all day.    The casino floor is smaller than most but not overly crowded and they have a nice selection of games.    The hotel rooms are newly renovated and they are nice and quiet!    This is a non-smoking casino so the casino smells great and is super clean. Drink service is fast too!
20,The speakers from the stadium penetrate the hotel walls. You cant relax in your room at all. You literally feel the bass in your chest while laying in bed. Imagine being exhausted from a long day and wanting to sleep but being completely unable to find any peace in your room. Nothing else notably bad but I wouldn’t stay at this property again.
50,The AM valet crew was amazing and very helpful this is my first time I made a trip to Las Vegas solo & they made me feel comfortable. They really liked my date which made me laugh. The house keepers were very friendly and nice.
50,"I've stayed at so many Vegas hotels but have to say I'll keep coming back here because the absolute best part of this hotel is that it's NON SMOKING! The common areas are pretty. The casino is smaller. They still have a central bar area to meet friends. One thing they are missing is a poker room but otherwise they have every other game. The rooms are pretty basic. They are supposed to look a little retro but they do feel a little cheap. We upgraded to a large suite and it was just fine... Beds are comfortable. I really love two restaurants there - Best Friend. It's funky and small and the food is DELICIOUS. I also love Primrose for breakfast. All you can drink mimosas are affordable and dangerous. I don't recall much of my day after my last ""breakfast"" there. We had an amazing server too. I wish I could recall her name but she was full of personality with dark long hair and we loved her. I didn't go to the pool this trip since it's winter but did in the past. It's a concrete jungle but very comfortable with plenty of chairs and options - there is a party pool and quieter pools too. Ready for a trip this summer."
40,Hotel & room are nice but the rooms are not sound proof. It always sounded like someone was getting into our room when the neighbors were actually getting into theirs. You can hear every flush and alarm that was going on in the other room.    Our hallway was very dim. It needed a change of lights or add more lights.    Room also did not have a mini fridge to store leftover food or drinks to get cold.
50,Park MGM provides fantastic options with games reasonable room rates and amazing restaurants with the added benefit of a smoke free casino and hotel. Don't miss 5 star service from Lisa Aggie and Brian in Bavette's Steak House and other locations in the Eaterly and casino.
50,Clean bed sheets and bathroom are the most important things we’re looking for when we’re on vacation. We received what’s expected on this hotel plus in the vicinity of where the action. Plus we love having the trams available to go from one hop from one hotel to another and explore more of the area.
50,Everybody at the park MGM was great to work with I don’t think these people know how to say no. Check in was perfect I believe this lady could’ve been a comedian. She sure broke the ice after a long plane ride. When you’re checking in you know you’re at the right spot. That is a great place to stay
40,The room was nice and clean but did not have a fridge coffee maker or grab bars in the shower. The pillows were huge and heavy. One of the mattresses was tilted or worn down without support. We had to walk a long distance from the elevators to our room.
50,Very happy with my stay and the way this hotel is run. Friday check-in was super quick and check-out was instant. While nothing is super fancy like Wynn or Encore everything worked and was quite functional which I appreciate much more than fancy. I'm not a big fan of Eataly but I did like the Primrose cafe that's located in the main lobby. There's no poker room if that's your thing but it's a close walk to Aria. Overall highly recommend and will certainly be staying here again.
20,We enjoyed our meals on this property the friendly staff and our room was clean! We thought our trip was nearly perfect besides the broken guest elevator. Riding in the service elevator made me feel as though the hotel doesn’t take pride in everything it does. We left Vegas feeling recharged and refreshed. Until two checks were presented against our banking account. One for 5k and another for 4.8k made payable to an auto service and repair shop. As I recalled where my checkbook was located during our stay at the Park MGM we realized someone who accessed our room took a check. They also managed to have my husband’s signature. Our guess is from the hotel front desks or restaurants where my husband signed for our room / meals. We reported the incident to the hotel. We also reported it to the police in Las Vegas Chino CA (where the check was presented) and to our local police. We spent days on the phone changing accounts and blocking our credit files. I have zero trust in any of the hotel staff now as the crime that occurred had to involve people with access to keys and the hotel computer system. I also was reminded of a good practice; never leave your valuables in a hotel room.
50,The process was smooth from booking to check out. Easy check in and checkout process. Friendly staff. Nice rooms and great location! I enjoyed the restaurant and all of the amenities. I highly recommend a stay at Park MGM.
50,Staff are attentive and courteous. Great location and Smoke free environment on the entire resort . Eataly is a wonderful place to get a snack or entire meal. Casino staff are friendly and knowledgeable. Great service throughout the entire Resort...
40,Great value at a all non-smoking property in the heart of the strip. Eataly redefines the concept of a high-end food court. The Library restaurant is an amazing setting featuring layer cake styled chandeliers and wall to wall classic books. At least a forty foot ceiling.
30,Great no smoking. Very nice staff but they skip room cleaning every other day (they say to be green) our paid view of the strip was the top of a parking garage. T stair ants were excellent and the staff was nice
40,I think parking should be free and rewards should be available immediately as this would encourage more people to choose MGM rewards. I did love the fact that it was a smoke free casino that alone made this place our choice.
40,Came out with my girlfriend and her 2 sisters to do some shopping. Didn’t know what I was looking for or that I would find myself in Vegas for a night but my Platinum comps came thru on a moments notice. Love MGM properties but for how much I gamble I wish the casino floor was larger.
40,We traveled for a soccer tournament with my daughters team. We choose Park MGM because of the non-smoking environment. Staff were friendly and attentive. Room sizes are a little small but overall comfy and nice.
50,The hotel staff from the front desk to housekeeping were friendly & professional. The food court has many options for food. Park MGM is in a perfect location on the Vegas strip to other activities and restaurants.
50,11th floor over looking the fortress. fun with the sounds and action out the window before the game. all quiet by the time we went to sleep. room was clean shower had pressure. why are there never hand helds?
40,No resort deserves a 5 star rating if they charge those ridiculous resort fees for amenities that are bad (wifi) or useless (gym/local calls). But Park MGM comes close w/ a great location reasonably priced rooms and a nice clean resort. Being able to check in and out from your cellphone is really great as is the digital key but using the digital key on the elevator was pretty hit amd miss.
50,This was my first time staying at Park MGM. I had been to the street food court before and was impressed. The property is clean and well-maintained inside and out. The staff is professional friendly helpful and attentive. The rooms are comfortable and decorated nicely.
50,This hotel is lovely. Rooms are spacious and clean. Staff is professional and friendly. Convenient to everything on the Strip either by walking or an inexpensive Uber ride. La La Noodle and Eataly are delicious!
40,The air was fresh and didn’t smell like smoke most of the time. With the exception of some people still smoking in the casino. I personally would have liked having more dining options open later. But besides that they stay was wonderful
50,Overall great location. 2nd year in a row staying and the only thing that's a negative is that they need to add refrigerators to the rooms. Clean facility smoke-free premises is a big plus and location is great.
50,It is possible to go to Las Vegas and not come home smelling like smoke! Beautiful hotel nice sized rooms great service and friendly staff. Easy checkin checkout valet service… this may just be my new favorite hotel on the strip.
50,We were only in Vegas for one night. I personally loved the color and decor of the room! The check in was fast and they offered a $50 food or drink credit for a fraction of the cost which was great. I would definitely stay there again. Very close to everything we wanted to do.
10,The only good thing about this hotel is the Eataly which is a great place to eat but the hotel room was very dirty. And staff wasn’t friendly and knowledgeable at all. I asked the front desk to have someone to come and clean and they said it was already clean (even though I see chips and some food on the side of the bed).
50,Check in was smooth and quick. The rooms were clean and beds are very comfortable. We enjoyed the bench seat at the window. Nice big bathroom and large shower. The casino is non smoking which is refreshing from other VERY Smokey casinos. Park MGM is in a great location.
50,Really nice hotel and we enjoyed that it was non smoking. Eataly was a great bonus too. We enjoyed drinks at The Juniper too. The rooms were very comfortable and since we drove in we appreciated the convenience of the parking garage. We would definitely stay again.
20,I've been going to Park MGM since 2020 and I absolutely loved it. It's a smoke free hotel and casino which is the reason I continue to go. However this time I can see the attention to detail is declining. The restaurants closer to the casino floors were not interested in me ordering a meal. Our shower has horribly drainage couldn't take more than a 5 minutes shower without your ankles being covered in water. And worse of all the smell of smoke in our room when we checked in. Even the housekeeper made a comment that he can bring in an air sanitizer for the strong smell. When we address this with the front desk the clerk told us that since our rooms are comped this is what we had available. Overall this experienced really changed my opinion with the hotel. I will be looking to stay elsewhere in the future
50,Honestly this review is primarily for the housekeeping staff. I had lost $30 (my winnings at a game of craps) at some point in my stay but figured I had dropped it on the casino floor at some point. I ended up getting a call from Park MGM a couple days after my stay about an item that could be mine at lost and found. Turns out I dropped it somewhere in my room. They called saying I might have left some cash and turns out it was that missing $30. It could've easily been pocketed but was returned by their honest staff (and yes I did leave a tip for housekeeping before leaving). Who does that these days?? Makes me have some faith in people.
50,Non-smoking Casino. Nothing else you need to know. You aren't choking on smoke and ash like in most other casino's. Definitely worth staying at Park MGM. Pretty good location for walking outside to other venues and stores. Definitely reccomend!
40,The location of this property cannot be beat. The fact that it is a smokefree property is the saving grace. The common areas are fantastic with many dining options. Drink service was nearly nonexistent on the casino floor. As for the hotel the hallways are extremely dark and long making my wife uncomfortable alone. The room was smaller and basic. It did not have a refrigerator or microwave if you need those things. Additionally the shower design made it impossible to keep all of the water in the shower; we wasted a towel every day on soaking up the water from the shower. The bed was comfortable but very low to the ground. My biggest complaint was the temperature of the room. It was very hot and stuffy in the room when we arrived. We immediately turned the temperature to 60 degrees and the fan on high. Unfortunately the room never got to a comfortable temperature throughout our visit.
40,We go to Vegas at least once a year and this was the first time we have stayed at Park MGM. Great location and being smoke-free is a very nice feature. Room was quirky but clean. Bed was very soft TV was at an angle from the bed so difficult to see the screen. Bathroom had a tub with shower attachment. I didn't think there were any bathtubs left in Vegas due to water shortages. There was no chest of drawers to place cloths in but there was an armoire to hang a few shirts up. Room was quiet housekeeping unobtrusive. There appear to be two small pool areas Check-in and -out were easy fast staff pleasant and helpful. Elevators were quick. Would stay here again. Some excellent food and drink options
30,Check in and check out was amazing but we had got unlucky with the room placement and unlucky with neighbors. But other than that it was a nice location you could get on the tram that takes you to aria and Bellagio.
30,Hotel was okay. I don’t think the price match the room. The staff was pleasant enough. Water was kind of hard on the skin. Quality of sheets were terrible.    The casino was pleasant enough and the restaurants were okay.
50,Park MGM is smoke free the location is great. Tram access to multiple hotels rooms are clean. Suggest at the time of check-in confirm if you need to request house keeping direct or if it's automatic.
50,You could potentially stay in the hotel for all your meals but my fiancé likes Denny's for breakfast and it was located across from Park MGM. The bridge to get across was right outside. We had tickets for KA Cirque du Soleil at MGM Grand and that was across the street and within walking distance. We ate at LaLaNoodle at Park MGM which had delicious food. Overall my fiancé enjoyed his birthday week celebration.
40,"Stayed at the Park MGM over the January 6 weekend to see the Raiders Golden Knights and a show. I don't stay at Vegas very often but the hotel overall was clean and easy to get around. ""Eately"" was great for breakfast and had a good burger from the Side Betty Grill while watching a game at the at the Sports Book Bar. View of the Strip was adequate but as is probably normal with many hotels they are set back quite a ways and most of the view was of parking garages or roof tops before the strip. Rooms were clean and adequate but nothing special - fair for the price."
10,The room was nice but the staff was horrible ask them anything they treat you like crap had to walk over to another resort to be assisted because anything I asked the staff they just didn’t have time for
50,I’ll say it again a non-smoking atmosphere in Vegas and it is a dream. Good selection of food convenient location on Las Vegas Boulevard the rooms are smaller than other properties but the non-smoking amenities are a dream. I love this resort!
50,We love the location of this hotel on the strip as well as the nicely appointed rooms. This hotel was previously the Monte Carlo. The best part is that the entire property is smoke free. My only complaint is that the hallways are very dark.
40,Overall I thought it was a great stay. I think they could have done a better job with the room renovations and the lighting on each floor. The hallways seems dark and dingy. The rooms felt as if I was at my old grandmothers house.
40,Perfect location on the strip. Rooms are minimalist and sparsely appointed with few frills as well as being dated and worn. The whole resort is non-smoking and this was the only reason we chose the resort.
50,Friendly staff and I love that the casino is smoke free! The bar staff was very friendly. I highly recommend this casino and hotel. The parking is super easy to access. The elevators are great because there are many of them available by floor.
50,Decided to stay at the Park MGM. Location was great. The food in the Eataly was excellent. This is also a smoke free casino/hotel which makes a huge difference for the non-smokers. Enjoyed every minute of my week long stay!
50,A great location great service great restaurants and helpful staff from Guest Services to Casino. My Sister & I had not been to Vegas for 3 years since the pandemic . It was a wonderful reunion to celebrate my upcoming Birthday... We had a wonderful time! Thank you!!!
10,The main reason for the 1 star review is due to the outside noise.  During hockey games it's unbearable. We were out all day having fun and went back to the room early evening to rest and clean up for dinner and shows that night. There was a hockey game starting soon and they were blasting music outside the arena like club level loud. I don't see how anyone outside that arena could even hear each other talk. The outside music was literally shaking the walls in our room. Then when we got back that night they play a giant air horn thing outside all night.    Also... The rooms need massive upgrades. No fridge mini-bar is non-existent no Smart TVs. All things that should be standard at a vegas strip resort.
10,"Resort fees... apparently someone had to think hard to come up with the ""explanation"" of why they decide to grab an additional $39+tax per night from the guest: property-wide high-speed internet access (public spaces and in-room) unlimited local and toll-free calls airline boarding pass printing and fitness center access for guests ages 18 and older. Some of that is useless and some is what every other hotel in the country provides for free.  So if you're proud of your resort fees I am more than happy to give you a ""2"". Will recommend my friend or colleague NOT to stay at Park MGM."
50,Great service in a comfortable setting. Room was comfortable with a clean fresh scent. Great service at the sports bar by Veronica. All the amenities to not have to leave. Easy fast check in process. Thank you!
20,really work/rotten down hotel mattresses not good. you hear everything from the neighbored rooms people in the hallway and obviously from the strip.    all rooms are with carpet!!!! happy days for allergic people and you can imagine a general smell in the room due to the carpet    the baisin looks dirty and disgusting.    in Europe Park Mgm would rather be a low budget hotel from what it is. Def not worth price/money    happy me staying here for a week…🤷🏻‍♀️
30,The service and room were not on the level that I am accustomed to. The room decor looked dark and outdated and there was a large opening under the door where I could see the light from the other guest's room and hear their constant coughing. I had to place a towel under the door.No bath mat on my first night and the people answering the calls from front desk room service and housekeeping never said hello upon answering and made it feel like they were annoyed that I was even calling for assistance.
30,The hotel lobby casinos and restaurants are extremely good. However the hotel carpets are stained everywhere. The Park MGM side of the hotel is not as good as the NOMAD. The rooms are dated do not have a fridge coffee and any potential amenities are for pay not complimentary. There are much better places to stay from a hotel perspective.
40,Good hotel with great staff and restaurants. Loved non-smoking throughout. Convenient location to many other hotels and restaurants. Even has tram to get to other hotels like Bellagio further away. Eately area was very nice.
10,Amenities were similar to a motel as opposed to a four star hotel. No free water coffee machine nor alarm clock. Was very loud between rooms and with noise from the nearby T Mobile Arena being loud as well. Initial shampoo provided was not enough and I had to ask for more.
50,We met our son for dinner on Saturday night. We ate at Bavette's Steakhouse. It was wonderful! We shared a large porterhouse steak between the three of us. The steak was done to perfection and the flavor was amazing!
50,Love this casino! Clean/air is fresh and staff fabulous. Restaurants have great food..discovered sports bar and Betty Side bar/grill and continued to be impressed..rooms were spacious clean quiet. Great experience thanks Park MGM
20,There was nothing fancy or breathtaking at this casino. The service at Primso was excellent. Lala noodles service was good but the soup must have been old because it made me sick. Overall is was good.
20,The bed smelled like vomit. It wasn’t addressed after I went to front desk. Checked out 2 days early. Stayed at another non mgm hotel. I was very disappointed with the resort. Regret not staying at a different mgm property
50,It was a nice clean property and non smoking which was the primary reason we stayed here. Will come and stay again. The Casino is not as big as some of the others but the smoke free environment made it worth while for us !
50,I love this casino because it’s non-smoking. In the other casinos I can’t breathe and I can’t stay in the casino very long. The park MGM is a beautiful hotel and the rooms are very nice and spacious. There’s a lot of restaurants inside including Eataly. This is an area where it has a bunch of different Italian small restaurants and lots of eating space.  Bavette’s is the steakhouse which is outstanding. I had the filet mignon and it was absolutely out of this world!
50,Great assortment of restaurants. Great location with easy access to Aria and Bellagio. Would like to see a safer crossing to NYNY. Rooms clean and modern. Casino was a lot less rowdy when compared to other casinos probably due to lack of smoking.
50,Great resort. We appreciate the smoke free environment. Conveniently located. Very walkable to other venues. Staff associates were professional and friendly. Covered parking is a great deal at $18 a day.
50,We had a great stay for a family member’s 40th birthday. Hotel and casino was clean and we easily found a place to watch the 49er game. Food and restaurants were wonderful. We will definitely stay again.
50,We are very happy with our stay. It was very nice being in a non smoking casino. My wife is a double lung transplant recipient and a non smoking casino was an easy choice. Hotel and room were very clean. We ate at LaLa Noodle and it was some of the best food we have ever had. We will definitely stay there again.
10,Room had a very loud fan noise and uneven temperature. Upon checking out I was hit with unexplained resort fees which seemed like a gimmick. Overall I will not be staying at Park MGM again when I return to Las Vegas
50,Pros:  - One of the only casinos on the strip where parking is not ten miles away. Hotel lobby is right off of self-park garage entrance.  - Mica at the VIP desk was AMAZING. She provided wonderful guest service and made check-in a breeze.  - 100% non-smoking hotel  - Food options are great! I had Side Betty Cafe and The Crack Shack.  - StayWell rooms are nice and have their own scent diffusers.    Cons:  - Parking is $18.00 for 24 hours of parking. I wish it was waived for locals.  - I wish resort fees were waived for locals.  - The first room I was assigned at check-in wasn’t fully cleaned. (Mica was very apologetic about that and upgraded me to the StayWell rooms thank you Mica!)
50,Non smoking is the best. Food was very good. Friendly staff. I also like how the area between the hotel and New York has been done. Traditionally I have stayed at Caesars properties because of better hotel deals for Total Rewards members but non smoking won me over.
50,From the location to the amenities; the fact that it’s The ONLY smoke-free property on the strip. The view was exceptional. The Stay-Well rooms at VERY relaxing we didn’t want to leave!!! Highly recommend!
50,Our first time staying in a regular room at the Park MGM was just as nice as the larger room we had previously. This trip was totally vacation so we spent very little time in the room. We love being able to go to Eataly for breakfast. The prosciutto croissants are amazing. And we tried Bavettes for the first time this trip. We will definitely be heading back there as well.
40,I have no issue with the facility but the hotel charged a resort fee of $35/day and the parking fee of $15/day is too stiff and too much. There are many other hotels offer free parking. I always stay at Park MGM (aka Monte Carlo) but will consider other resort in the future trip.
40,Cannot beat the location as it’s pretty much in the middle of the strip. We had tickets to Aerosmith at the Dolby Theatre in the Park MGM as well as tickets for a Las Vegas Knights game at the T-Mobile arena which is located next door so perfect staying here. The rooms are very clean fair size with very comfortable beds. Our air conditioning worked great even though it was quite hot during our stay which we usually find alto be an issue in other hotels we have stayed at in Vegas. Overall the rooms were pretty quiet and we had maid service daily. There are tons of food and bar options close by.    We did have an issue with a second room we had booked for our son and daughter in law. Upon check in he had gone to the front desk probably 5-6 times as their room was never ready and it was almost midnight before they finally got their room which had two beds instead of the king size bed which was originally booked. Some of the staff were actually pretty rude telling him oh well consider yourself lucky if you even get into your room tonight! They also had to go to get their keys reissued twice as they were noted as “checked out” on their 3rd and 4th days of their 4 night booking. It was quite frustrating having to keep checking even though they had his cell number to text.    We would definitely stay at the Park MGM again due to its location and comfortable rooms.
40,Qualification: we used Las Vegas as a stopover between The Grand Canyon and Death Valley. It's not my cup of tea though is a very impressive place. If only it wasn't full of drunk awful people!  There that's me done.    The hotel was excellent from the ease of finding the car park to the quality of the room. All very nice. Hugely expensive food wherever you went (to be expected it's Las Vegas after all). No complaints at all.
40,MGM app enabled me to check in from the road and avoid lines. Mobile app didn't work on my husband's phone when I added him and was flakey on the elevators. We both needed physical cards. My Nighthawk suite didn't have a wet bar and I was told it would when I called. Not a lot of food options but great if you like Italian.
20,Non-smoking is nice and the casino floor looks good but the guest floors and hotel rooms were awful. The carpet was dingy and dirty the shower drained slowly so I was standing in a pool of dirty water the thermostat didn't work there was a sticky stain on the TV and it just felt like a dingy off-strip fleabag motel. I would not stay here again.
50,We go to Vegas every year but have never stay here. We loved the rooms and it was very quiet and smoke free!! Not too big and my son won a jackpot the first night!! The Primrose was delicious! We will definitely stay here when we go back in May!!! Our new favorite place!
20,The rooms are too small (we had an alleged upgraded room) the AC never got the room cool we found condoms and what appeared to be a hand towel with human fluids on it they do not offer the option of a fridge or coffee maker and the staff are not friendly. It’s also so loud at night they give you ear plugs.
40,First time staying here. I overall enjoy the experience. My main grips were the lack of a mini fridge too small in room safe and the experience using the digital key from the phone. I had problems with this and I noticed others did as well. I ended up just having an actual card key made.
50,Great staff prices are good when you consider location parking was easy bell desk folks are wonderful great food options. The no smoking was amazing! 10/10 would return again! Thank you to the staff at park MGM
40,The hotel is at the top of the strip and a good location. On arrival I thought the hotel looked a little tired in the hallways and lobby.  There are a couple of outside pool which were warm and had an attendant. The ground floor has a gambling area and tables which was large and took a lot of the area. There was a Starbucks and they had a market style area to purchase a variety of food burgers pizza fish all like little stalls. Quite cute. There was a sports bar and a regular bar  restaurant and a shop.  The room was ok. A good size with a nice bathroom and lovely sheets.  Again you had to pay the dreaded room tax. This is annoying because this goes directly to the hotel and is just an added tax to make money.  Sooner or later people are going to stop visiting as it’s costly.  Worth visiting the mob museum and old strip. You will need to get on a bus as it’s too far to walk  Good value for the price. However I have stayed in other countries for the same price and it included breakfast. We went to Denny’s opposite for ours.
10,The rooms were old and the walls are paper thin so you can hear every word spoken from the rooms on either side. The hotel is next to the T-Mobile arena which has a giant outdoor video screen that plays ads and music at high volume until the wee hours of the morning.
50,Very hospitable clean overall awesome resort! The staff is friendly restaurants are very pleasant to do business with. They are also thoughtful and will do their best to get you a table in a timely matter.
10,Shower was not working and a huge issue. No time to report before checkout as I had an appointment to rush to. Standard amenity has to function and did not resulting in being sweaty and dirty for my business meeting.
50,I love that this casino is a non-smoking casino. Throughout the casino floor and can breathe clean air. Every member of the staff are extremely friendly and helpful. I would recommend this hotel to family and friends.
30,I stayed at the Park MGM during CES and I honestly expected so much more. For starters on the second day - I found that the bed I’d been sleeping on was stained with blood. I was so appalled and disgusted and took a photo. I went downstairs to show the photo to the front desk and I was the staff person simply apologized and said she’d take off a resort fee. I don’t know about you - but for blood stained sheets - I was expecting a lot more in terms of a resolution. To top it off they don’t offer complimentary water and added it to the mini bar. What kind of hotel doesn’t offer water? Lastly of the other hotels I’ve stayed in Vegas - Park MGM had the least to see or do. Literally had to leave each night just to get a good meal and a drink. Very disappointed.
20,Had property stolen from my hotel room - AirPods on my nightstand were taken by what I assume to be housecleaning staff. Reported it but no resolution thus far. I had opted out of housecleaning and had a do not disturb on the door but my room was still accessed at some point during the day. Unacceptable. Make sure you lock up your stuff or keep it on you
10,A joke of a resort  no coffee makers no nothing in the rooms but a complete lack of design. Also housekeeping sucks filthy sinks and hair left from previous guest. No water stations and a very pricy gift shop
50,We had a great 3 night sat the PARK MGM... from the smoke free mellow ambiance to the great breakfasts the new years fireworks to to the amazing upgrade we had a most wonderful stay and celebration to the new year.
10,This place is disgusting and disappointing. The lobby looks nice you get to the room… looks like a garage sale of furnishings. Old grungy worn out. No refrigerator. No coffee maker. The mattress sinks like an old ship I’m sure we will all have back aches … NEVER stay here. All the other MGM properties are up to the reputation not this one!! Avoid
30,If you are a frequent Vegas traveler and like quality I say avoid park and try to stay on the NoMad levels. Park front desk clerks are rude incompetent and will tell you things that aren't true. This is not ok when you are a Platinum or higher member. The rooms on the Park levels are run down dingy filthy carpets and dirty sheets routinely. Be prepared for this if going for a busy holiday or during one of their busy concert times. You will deal with stressed staff and stressed accommodations/services.    If you must and have the opportunity go through a host I suggest Andrew or Michael Meservey. They are knowledgeable personable and straightforward. Can address all things or put you though to the right people. Avoid check-in if possible if staying at park and used the mobile app and avoid the front desk unless you absolutely have to. If staying on the NoMad side you definitely want to say hi to the front desk staff and get the whole experience.    Casino is smoke free easy to navigate great location easy walk over to Aria which increases options on Gambling and food. Aria is not smoke free<---.    It gets hectic there when busy you can encounter a run-down room but in summary it's a great place for rewards type people and beats Caesars rewards by leaps and bounds.
50,Nice Remodel of Monte Carlo for the price you can’t get a better location to TMobile or City Center. The staff we encountered was very courteous and took care of any request we had. Casino was clean not a hint of smoke in the entire place and that was nice because I brought my family this trip. I’ll stay here again I feel it was a great value and didn’t miss any amenities.
30,The hotel was a let down. The room is awkwardly dark with awkward placed lighting. The shower situation makes a mess everywhere as there is no division between the bathroom and shower floor. I wish the hotel can make it right
40,I have been always with mgm properties from the beginning n is been almost 5 years of service. Whether I have been to be Vegas or National harbor i like the casino n hotel both.  Also the rewards which you send frequently
50,The Park MGM is a good place to stay if you don't have a car  Almost in the middle of the strip. The mobil app is a good thing too. Our flights were delayed  We got there a day late. But our room was waiting for us
30,The eataly restaurants look better than they taste overpriced and frequently mess up what one orders. I did enjoy the great location. Coffee needs to be sold at a reasonable price. No decent restaurants for kids.
40,Stayed over NYE weekend. Hotel casino and food is nice. Food is amazing actually. Good staff. Cons. No coffee maker in room no fridge in room sheets weren't very comfy. Digital room key doesn't always work on door or in elevator. Quick charge mini bar. Super loud music for 3 hours pre hockey games that will shake your room. This started at 9am when we wanted to sleep in. Not cool. It was full concert level sound with no concert or people. Be advised. And we love loud music. Just not at 9 am trying to sleep. I get it its Vegas but this was excessive. Staff is great. Great location for hotel. Love smoke free everything. Casino is fun. Eataly is awesome! Just like Europe! The other places to eat there all 5 star!
40,PROS: The location is fantastic. Many attractions within walking distance and the tram to Bellagio makes it even easier. The food choices at Park MGM are also great especially Lala Noodle. We are there 3 times during our stay and loved everything. The beds are comfy and the water pressure is fabulous!    CONS: The casino is okay at best. Not nearly as many slot options as other casinos. The slots did not pay at all at Park MGM. No coffee maker or refrigerator in the room.
10,The hotel is a disaster is not remodeled as they promote on their pictures trust me.  So we arrived the day of our reservation and they said they had no rooms (it was 1am enough time after our check in time) si finally they gave us our two rooms in opposite buildings but so tired we went up to sleep. So one of our room doesn’t open with the key they gave us (we figured malfunction of the key or something… nop you’ll never guess the room was occupied we almost entered a room with guests sleeping inside! When we got to the front desk the kid (started laughing about it in a rude way almost making fun of us) we never tought that was funny) then we asked that if our next room would be 100% guaranteed that no one would be inside he answered CANT CONFIRM THAT and I said and could some enter our room just as we almost did he said yeah thats housekeeping fault cant confirm the manager of the shift was a maaaajor diaaster… the rooms are not okay the bathroom had pee stains in the floor!!!  We has to ask to make the room when we got at 7pm the second night cause they did not.  Dont stay there wynn encore resorts world not mgm.
20,The location was really good. The rooms cleaning was worst. The people who clean the room they are not changing towels they just redesign and put it back. The hotel is average hotel in compare to others. Front desk staff was so polite and friendly. The luggage keeping staff when I was there to drop off and pick up my luggages they look at you by purpose that why you not give me a tip(which I can’t tip them 2 times for just one luggage) that other thing make person uncomfortable.
50,Park MGM is one if our all time favorite MGM resorts on the Las Vegas strip. Clean professional and smoke free. Best Friend is an amazing spot for some great food. On the Record is a fun nightclub just steps away from the hotel room. Super convenient.
10,Treat you like dirt even if you have large wagers  Worst service I’ve experienced in decades  Eatily was average overpriced and over cooked.  Room service lost items from our room  Management doesn’t even have the courtesy to return phone calls or emails
50,First stay at Park MGM and we will be back! Love that it was non-smoking the aesthetic and design felt clean and the bed was rather comfortable (but really low to ground). I’m so glad there is daily housekeeping back!
20,The room smell horrible . There was trash hidden I. The cabinet under the sink . I called the 3 times to have someone pick it up and nobody came . I finally went ti the front desk to report it the following day and that’s when it was removed about 11 am the next day . The room had the most awful smell .
30,The room was pretty small and there were no refrigerators provided. The bathroom had a stand up shower which was not ideal for a baby. The digital check in was pretty easy to use and follow. However without wifi or data u need a physical key. Self parking was 26 bucks for 24hr parking no in & out so that was expensive. Only free for club card members Pearl & above. Luckily my dad was a Gold Member.
20,I got a text from some stalker stating my room number. He said he put money on my room & the hotel sent him a receipt with my room number confirmation number & my home address where my son was staying with a baby sitter!! Very unprofessional- they did change my room & credit me for one night (the cheapest night).
50,Good non smoking hotel to Stay.clean and neat hotel with good services. They also have the best Dolby theater . This place has good restaurants as well. It is in middle of strip. It also has tram service access to aria and bellagio resorts.
50,Love the location easy to walk the strip lots of options for food and beverage very easy to check in and out with mobile device love the smoke free atmosphere. Just wish the mattresses were a little more comfy.
30,As a MGM rewards member I have always enjoyed nice accommodations and great atmosphere in our hotel stays. I was taken aback with the quality of accommodations offered at this hotel. The first room was so lacking (stained carpet damaged furniture etc) I went down to the desk and needed to be assigned another room. While they jumped through hoops until they found a room this room still was lacking in quality (I felt this was more of lower end economy hotel- not what was billed).
40,HAD GOOD SERVICE THE ROOMS WHERE VERY CLEAN as was all of the hotel. this was for a family trip after Christmas and before New Years. Everything at the MGM's went great except the lines at the reward counter. they were way over the top to long
40,Really nice property with a great location. A little further from Bellagio and the other casinos but still in walkable distance. Hotel is surrounded by New York New York and MGM and other properties. Also lots of restaurants and shopping stores close by and in walkable distance.
40,This is a 2-way review.  I enjoyed my stay at Park MGM the rooms were nice and clean. However I didn't feel the staywell room was worth the upgrade.  (4 stars)    The Table Games are above average here me and my wife preferred that casino over most of the others on the whole strip.  Dealers Mike S Kevin & Francisco were great dealers hospitable nice and helpful to those who needed. Those 3 guys alone made our trip even more enjoyable.  (5 stars)
40,Great location & friendly staff Rooms have SUPER comfy pillows. Connected to Aria and Crystal Mall easy access to Cosmopolition & Planet Hollywood with bridge walkway but very limited rooms w/bathtubs which have cracked paint and older.
50,Great hotel and enjoy the fact that is a smoke free resort. The rooms a big and the bathrooms very nice. Staff at the hotel are very pleasant. Just wish that they would bring back the $1 roulette tables.
10,Every thing will cost you an arm then a leg and you’ll eventually have to sell kidneys to buy water food and let’s not forget that you have to pay to park at the casino you chose to sleep at. But not to worry maybe you’ll win it all back!! Good luck!!
40,As very sensitive non smokers my wife and I were ecstatic to stay at a100% non smoking hotel and casino. That aspect of why we'll be back 100%. Where we wished it was better: Beds are moderately comfortable not great. No poker tournaments/rooms in the casino. $15 minimum bet tables are the lowest you'll find (and even those are 1/2 the time with $25 min tables being the norm). Could it be better? Yea but non smoking was the killer feature of the hotel. A++++
40,Nice hotel carpet could be replaced rooms could use some updating. Beds and pillows were comfy. Nice central location to everything. Nice casino and amenities nice parking garage good restaurants good staff.
50,Park MGM is the best hotel casino in Las Vegas. The non smoking makes it a fantastic place to bring your family. Especially if you bring kids or elderly adults to stay. The non smoking environment is fantastic. Also the dealers are always friendly as is the staff members.
40,Hotel was beautiful. Loved that hotel and casino are smoke free. Great location on the strip. Rooms were nice. Nothing exceptional. No refrigerator which isn’t ideal. Maid service cleaned only once while we were there. Changed out towels but that was it.
50,Park MGM is hands down the best hotel on the strip. Love that it is non-smoking resort. The Eataly section at the front of the resort is a great place to get some great food and/or drink. Staff members are all very friendly!
40,Great location on the south side of the Strip. The staff are friendly and helpful. The rooms and bathrooms aren't anything incredible but they are good sizes and are most everything you need for a room in Vegas. Mine was lacking a mini fridge though which would've been useful. Although they may have provided one if asked.
40,Hotel in a great location on the strip. It has lots of restaurants and has the only smoke free casino. The hallways is a little dark though. The contactless check in and out is great. Refrigerators in the rooms would be great too.
50,Had a great time at the Park MGM... most importantly it's a smoke free hotel and casino... great atmosphere food entertainment and staff are very friendly and helpful... BIG thank you to Catherine Heng-Liberty our Host who went above and beyond for making our stay so enjoyable!
40,The size of the casino was just perfect easy to find your group. Music was on point for our age group loved it every night. Tho I didn't win big the machines paid enough to keep us playing without breaking the bank. Food at Eataly was Excellent also Toscana was very accommodating our 1st night when we didn't have resv. anywhere they took us in immediately food was exceptional.  I will never book thru a 3rd party for you cannot change anything about your room last minute that stinks.
10,We check -in around 7ish found out sink looks like used we ignored then found hair nearby ice bucket I suspect check the bed both had stains one from make up and the other blood stains. The side sofa was looking dirty. It was horrible experience. End up calling then they move us to higher floor but hallways are dirty dark looks like horror movies. Was scared going to casino.  I had some pics to share
30,The hotel & casino were clean and I appreciated that the casino did not smell like smoke but our rooms were very small. We thought our rooms would be better since we purchased a Bruno Mars package which was not cheap.
50,This hotel is really clean and the rooms are excellent. It’s located right on the strip and it’s close to every thing. I love that no one is allowed to smoke at this hotel and I feel way better bringing my family here to stay.
30,We were so blessed to be able to ring our New Year’s in enjoying one of our favorite artist! We choose to stay at the Park MGM so we didn’t have to worry about transportation. Our accommodations though fell short of our expectations. Our room was very old and I expected a more updated room. That didn’t stop off from enjoying our time in Vegas! That was the first time we stayed at this hotel and not sure we would stay there again.
50,The hotel is in a great location! The room was spacious and clean the only inconvenience was that it didn't have a refrigerator. I loved the Sportsbook and the sports betting machines throughout the property very convenient!  Will definitely stay again.
10,I will never come to an MGM property again after being racially profiled at your hotel made me feel so depressed and sad inside thinking that this type of behavior still exist in today’s world. I will never come back to your property.
20,Otherwise skip.  Way too many options nearby at the same price point that are materially better. This hotel is purely event-based location.    Do try Lala Noodle - that was outstanding. And Dolby Live is A+
40,Great option for those who like to breathe! Nice casino nice rooms good bar service good restaurant options. Primrose for breakfast and Lala Noodle were tasty dining options. More Italian food in Eataly than we could ever get through. We'll be back.
30,Decent hotel for the price. Small room comfy bed no fridge or coffee maker. Really foul musty smell through the hotel and the room smelled like old covered up smoke. Casino was nice. Eatery was amazing.
10,Don’t buy package. It’s over priced. 150 food credit you have to be deligent to make sure the dinner receipt reflects it was charged to room. Manager said it was but it was charged To my credit card and we received no food credit.
10,We purchased the Bruno Mars concert package for New Year’s Eve via our MGM REWARDS membership. The room accommodations were unacceptable for the cost of the package. There were only 2 Desk clerks to check in the huge crowd so the wait was long. Room service was 1.5 hours late and food was inedible. Will never stay at this property again!
50,This non-smoking casino makes all the difference in the world to make your stay enjoyable! The Eataly food court has some of the best drinks and snacks on the strip. We especially enjoyed the Old Fashion’s and Lemoncello spritzers.
40,Clean smoke free hotel centrally located on the strip. Plenty of restaurants a speakeasy and perfect for attending events at Allegiant Stadium or T-Mobile Arena. I would gladly recommend this hotel to family and friends.
50,What an amazing New Years experience in Vegas. Park MGM did an amazing job can't say enough great things! The staff was very friendly and helpful. Bruno Mars live!! The smoke free environment was the icing on the cake!
30,I booked a strip view double queen. The room was a decent size for a 2 bed but the view was slightly obstructed and the AC wasn’t really working so the room became stuffy quite quickly. The closet barn door doubles as the bathroom barn door.The pool left a lot to be desired and what’s with the 2” space between lounge chairs? I was practically on top of my lounger neighbor. Which led to them being covered in my lunch when the wind blew my plate over onto them…the waitress was too busy to listen to me explain the wind knocked over my plate. So I had no food replacement and no more time to wait to try to get some sort of resolution.They should’ve kept the Monte Carlo lazy river. The QR code ordering system was awesome but kinda takes away from the experience a bit. The location is great. Wish there were more food options. Eataly was so crowded and busy and long waits for a quick yet expensive bite. The chicken place was crazy busy too for a Sunday evening. Loved the tram system to Bellagio. If I was seeing another show here again I’d stay here but otherwise I’d probably book elsewhere. Miss my Monte Carlo.
50,Good hotel!! Great location and customer service. I was disappointed that there wasn’t a mini fridge and microwave in the room. The bed and pillows weren’t the best either. I love that the hotel is a smoke free property!!.
40,Always stay at Park MGM for our trips to vegas. Love that it’s nonsmoking central to everything if. Eataly is downstairs finally tried Best Friend which was good. Also tried Side Betty and their cheeseburger was really good! Only wish there was a mini fridge to keep our leftovers in. We had no way to store our leftovers from Best Friend and Eataly so we had to throw our food away and felt bad. Also the pillows could also be a bit better there was no neck support.
30,A nice room with basic features no refrigerator or microwave but clean and good location. No dresser in the room but how much do you really use them if you’re there longer than 4 days that may be annoying. Average for location and price it’s a nice room.
50,I highly recommend staying at the Park MGM. The hotel is updated smoke free and in a prime location for all of the Vegas attractions. The shuttle to the Bellagio was super convenient on a chilly night out. Housekeeping was prompt front desk was super helpful and the feel of the hotel was warm and welcoming. We dined at The Crack Shack for quick service and Nomad Library for a sit down dinner. Both were delicious. Nomad Library had great table side experiences and live music.
50,I love how easy it is to get around and accessible to nearby stores and properties.    Eataly is clearly the highlight and provides a lot of great options all throughout the day.    Sportsbook was fun but I had to go to NY NY to get my printouts. There’s also an unwritten agreement that if you earn a comp drink ticket per $100 spend. Sometimes I felt like I was pulling teeth to get a ticket. I think it’s a missed opportunity to wow gamblers. Seems like the overall mindset is to automate everything which allows for a bad guest experience that can’t be corrected immediately.
50,Although it was probably one of the busiest weekends the lines were short and moved fast. Primrose cafe was also quick. Our room was clean and stocked. The front desk staff was very helpful explaining charges.
50,There is nothing more to say about Park MGM - it is the ultimate place to stay when in Vegas because of all the great things it has to offer. But most importantly - being a non-smoking hotel says it all for me.
50,This resort was very clean smoke free friendly staff and very comfortable. It would have been nice to have Starbucks or a snack store stay open later but that is in all hotels. I would 110% return here.
30,We are not really impressed your Room services and check-in and out services. The experience was okay. We were put in standard room. We called the front desk for housekeeping services but no one came.
20,Overall not very satisfied. For the price you are paying you would expect the room to be nicer Than what it actually is. Location was good on the strip no doubt but beyond that it was not a pleasurable experience. Room was dirty and uncomfortable to be in.
10,Just Ok room look run down. Location is not great spend your money at a better property! I was called at 1:00am and woken from a deep sleep and was told it was a room check. Location is really not ideal at all. It’s too expensive for what it is! Spend your money else where
50,Happy Holiday memories from Las Vegas made with our family and friends new places to explore and food ventures various shows to see granddaughter enjoyed the PRINCE Review Michael Jackson next time we're there
20,Location is good staff needs improvement. front desk specially they have no clue what hospitality really is. Even if you turn down requests there’s a way to do it. I did like the location was quite central.
50,We have stayed many places in Las Vegas but only stay at the Park MGM now. Hotel and staff are outstanding. Great having a smoke free environment. So many places to eat. Lots of benefits for Military as well.
30,I must say when I entered the room I was extremely underwhelmed. This was a standard king room. The room was dark and minimal. The strip view was quite nice....There were no bath towels in the room on arrival so I called down and some were brought up. The next day housekeeping took these towels and didn't replace them! I spoke to the front desk who sorted this. They also took the used glasses and never replaced those either! Housekeeping was then minimal for the rest of the week. The bathroom was pretty small but the shower was good. Having stayed in a lot of hotels on the strip I would say this is near the bottom. Great casino and hotel but the rooms are just not that good. This was a 'green' room perhaps the 'red' rooms are better?!
30,Hotel was clean modern but the maintenance and house keeping section was so poor. I asked several times for room service and no one cared. I spent long time behind the line to ask for a simple request.
40,The location is the biggest positive. The rooms are clean beds are very comfortable but the furniture in the rooms are lacking. The rooms are a long way from the strip. Food options could be better.
40,Loved the location of the property and the fully renovated rooms and non smoking makes it a great stay for us. Connection to Aria for tram access to Bellagio and Eately inside the property is a huge bonus. Only complain is that the amount of EV chargers on location is not sufficient to satisfy all the EV clientele
50,We enjoyed our short stay at Park MGM visiting family for the holidays. Every staff member we encountered was extremely nice. The rooms have plenty of space and we’re clean and remodeled like a boutique style hotel. The casino is smoke free which is great for families and the location on the strip can’t be beat. We will stay here again.
50,My husband and I had a very nice stay. We really appreciated the non-smoking atmosphere. The room was very nice and we felt like it was a good value. We also enjoyed eating at Eataly and Primrose right in the building. We do wish there had been a microwave and fridge but it wasn’t that big of a deal.
50,Best Friend and Eataly are great spots to eat and On the Record might be my favorite club on the Strip. It's a small space with a speakeasy karaoke and a patio with a double-decker bus so it's super unique.
50,Very pleased with my stay at Park MGM will definitely return in future Vegas trip especially with the MGM Rewards member benefits of free parking and special room rate. Very happy with the food quality at Eataly as well.
50,Just got back from our stay at the Park MGM. The lobby casino and main floor area where amazing. Clean smoke free and Eataly was a great section (though very pricey). The rest of the hotel hasn't been updated as the carpets were old and dirty but our room was great. Would definitely recommend this hotel. It's place on the strip was nice too.
50,Good choice for holidays .great location in the middle of everywhere. Plenty of choice restaurants and dining. Asian restaurants around and near shopping spots. Staffs are friendly and helpful. Sky train to go other casinos across.
50,Great state. We had a wonderful time and a fantastic experience. The hotel was great. The casino was great and all of the staff was great. We plan to return in the future. Eataly area was awesome. Hotel central to the strip.
30,The staff is friendly and nice but I got some misinformation at times. I expected the room to be a little nicer. No fridge cuz it would have been $35/day for one. It’s not one of those bright and beautiful places.
30,Great location and convenient hoping over to other hotels  The mattresses in the room were too too soft and sunk 1-11/2 feet when I laid down. Me and my family still have back ache and not fully recovered.
20,We put the 'Do not disturb' hanger on the door (since my kids need some sleep) but the house keeper still knocked the door 3 times in a single day and one of those was at 2am!!!    I expected respect for simple guest requests at such a Hotel but was really annoyed and disappointed by what happened.
10,I booked a suite for Christmas week. I thought a smoke free hotel would be clean but it wasn't! The room smelled so bad we asked to be moved. We were told we would have to wait until something became available which took 6 hours. The carpet and sofa had several round stains that smelled. By the number of dogs on the casino floor we are assuming it was dog pee or poop stains. We even saw dogs pee on the casino floor several times during our trip. As we all know Service Dogs are trained they stay by their owner they don't bark pull growl or pee on things. I'm sure not everyone is honest and pays the clean up fees for their pets. Their should be cameras in the hallways and if pets (NOT SERVICE ANIMALS) are seen going into the room the customer has the $100 per night added to the room. So many people lie and pretend their dogs are service animals to avoid the fee. I'm assuming because the hotel doesn't know or care about cleaning up after the pets they aren't enforcing the per night pet charge. I'm a Noir and a loyal MGM customer Park MGM treated us horribly. It was a very slow day when we checked in and the people in VIP couldn't of been lazier.
40,We like the smoke free hotel and casino. The employees are friendly and helpful the hotel was very clean and plenty of security personnel to keep homeless out. they do need more cocktail waitresses it was difficult to get a beverage
30,My son and future daughter-in-law were marrying at The Little White Chapel and the entire family stayed at the park MGM for this joyous event. We were just disappointed in the room cleanliness when the staff would come and make the beds and not clean the rest of the room leaving it Dusty and bathrooms untouched. One of the family member had a room where the bed nor the room ever got touched
10,Why is the newest hotel/casino on the strip one of the crappiest? Want to get charged for your child picking up a snack for 10 secs? Come here. Want to have a shower that doesn’t drain? Come here. Want to have a tv that has no sound? Come here. Want to absolutely no option of late night food? Come here. Do you want no drawers and a 1 ft long rack to hang your clothes? Come here. The smoke free environment is JUST NOT WORTH IT!
50,We spent a lot of time in this casino. It was refreshing to be smoke free and the dining options were great! It was also conveniently located near shopping with such conveniences as Target Walgreen’s and CVS.
30,We arrived at night getting off the elevator the area and hallways are dimly lite. You need a flashlight to locate the how to turn on the lights and where to turn them on. Rocker switches are archaic.
50,Stayed for a couple of nights right before Christmas. Room was perfect with a view towards T-Mobile (perfect for me). We went to a Knights game had a great breakfast and dinners loved Eataly. Enjoyed walking the strip up to Bellagio and taking in Crystal's and the Bellagio conservatory (Beautiful!) and fountain.
40,Giant casino hotel on the Las Vegas strip. The only smoke free casino and hotel so far! Great place for allergy sufferers!    But...    It is also dog friendly so beware if you are allergic to pet dander!    We paid extra to have a Las Vegas strip view. Excellent views from our 21st floor.    Room service was prompt. Amazing considering the size of the property!    Shower had good pressure with lots of consistent hot water.    Bathroom and closet door is combined in a single barn style door. Weird because a person leaving the bathroom can hit a person with the same door who is trying to access the closet!    Convenient check out. Just dial 0 on the room phone!
50,The Park MGM is a nonsmoking hotel and casino plus it has an Eataly! It is a perfect combination. Nice hotel and excellent food. What more do you need. Easy to get around because you are close to a monorail stop. I highly recommend.
40,Love the place due to its atmosphere and how close is it to strip. If you want no problems stay within the hotels as much as possible. Problem is outside homelessness near strip pretty scary with each character on full display it's disgusting in 2022.
40,Very well located hotel with easy access to the strip. A bridge just in front of the hotel allows us to easily cross the Strip.    Very courteous staff at reception. The young woman who served us was very nice and smiling. Unfortunately we do not remember her first name. She was at the VIP counter on December 23 around 2 p.m.    Very nice and big rooms. We slept so well. Bathroom and nice big shower. Discreet helpful and smiling chambermaids (18th floor).    Concierge Kevin Guerrero responded to our emails regarding a guided tour of Allegiant Stadium and how to get there long before we arrived at the hotel. He was so kind and patient. We wanted to go thank him but he was absent the day we went.    Excellent LaLa Noodle and Primrose restaurants and what about EATALY and its excellent food counters and all those products from Italy.    We will return very soon and it will undoubtedly be the hotel that we will choose for all our future trips to Las Vegas!
40,Nice clean hotel no smoking. Just had an issue when it came to lack of late night eating options in the hotel. We had to go out on the strip for a good late night snack. Parking was an issue when there were hockey games streets were blocked off for that traffic.
40,Overall good experience. 100% the best thing this hotel has going for it is the absence of cigarette smoke. The staff is extremely gracious and helpful. The restaurants are all amongst the best. Very highly recommend Lala noodle and Best Friend. The rooms are average the beds are too soft. Temperature control is difficult. The casino is small but nice would like to see greater variety of table games and more tables open more frequently. Overall had a great trip and would stay here again primarily because the 2nd hand smoke in Vegas is too much to deal with at this point
50,A quick birthday trip for my nephews 21st birthday. He wanted to stay as close to the rest of the family as possible so we booked at the The Park MGM Las Vegas. It totally exceeded all expectations. Everyone we encountered was kind and helpful. The facilities were well-kept and clean. I found it was easy to maneuver through without feeling overwhelmed. Our room had everything we needed and everything worked well. The hotel is in a Good central location to the other MGM properties. We also took the monorail from the Park MGM to the Bellagio which was very convenient. I would definitely stay again.
50,Park MGM continues to offer clean comfortable accommodations.  The tram to nearby Aria and Belagio is so convenient.  Eataly is a fun spot with great meal choices. The Dolby Theatre is great being attached to the Park. Fun to just saunter out of the theatre into the casino.
40,Hotel was very reasonable price to stayed 3 nights because of good location eatery and lala noodles were great and also 5 minutes ride free train to bellagio hotel. Room was fine but their MGM towels and bedding was so comfortable. Will definitely back to their hotel again.
50,Always a pleasant stay. Rooms are clean and comfortable and plenty of delicious food options. Smoke-free casino is extremely comfortable to gamble in and nice to be able to walk through without smelling like an ashtray.
50,The hotel staff was friendly food verity and quality was excellent and I love the smoke free casino. Would highly recommend this property. Being close to the hockey arena and easy access to the rest of the strip was great fun.
40,Non smoking environment was the best. Very family friendly. Very easy to find parking and just short walk to the lobby. The Italian eatery has lots of selection. Location is great when you walk out you are right on strip.
30,It had been years since we were in Vegas so wasn’t sure what to expect. Room was small dimly lit as were hallways. Elevators were fast. Food options were few and very expensive. Housekeeping was hit or miss
20,It took me 3 phone calls for them to fix a broken lamp bedside the bed with exposed wires. It also took me 3-4 trips to the front desk to discuss key not working on their self park garage getting assurance that the key will work only to find out after I complained that when you check in using APP that you also use your APP for self parking. For Front Desk not to know this is beyond terrible. I had to pay twice to get out of garage and attendants at garage were questioning me when they should know themselves. They even watch me pay when they could have let me out totally disgusted with my stay there and will never go back at Park MGM. I might try ARIA but maybe Caesar’s will be a better choice.
20,There’s not much special about this place. The rooms are reminiscent of a Hilton garden inn. I could hear the conversation in room adjacent to mine. Of all the Vegas properties I’ve stayed this year (Bellagio Venetian Monte Carlo Vdara) this is the most lackluster.
50,We had a blast at Park MGM. Staff always kind and great drinks! I usually have better luck but not so much on this trip. But that's ok because I am usually a winner. My favorite casino to visit since it is a non smoking casino!
50,Good hotel great location. Recently renovated. Best Friend and Bavettes are both must eats. Eataly is alot of fun too. One of the better experiences you will have on the strip for the money.    There are several great places to go within walking distance as well.
40,The service was good. Very friendly.  I took my 14 year old dog during the trip and she felt very comfortable like our home. Definitely want to come back next time.    The casino is little bit smaller than other larger hotel but I can go to other casinos.
40,This place has a nice view with a couch a comfortable bed. But the rooms don't come with refrigerator or a microwave or coffee maker. We didn't find anything for room service if you didn't feel like leaving your room for a while. Overall it is pretty.
50,Excellent introduction to Vegas strip with amazing Italian restaurants. The room was very clean and quiet at night. This was what I was looking for as I was passing through and It was close the car rentals and airport.
10,Casino is smoke free and clean. Eataly provides lots of delicious choices but is grossly overpriced even by Las Vegas standards. Rooms are dirty and dated with virtually nowhere to put your stuff. We moved rooms once as the first room had an extremely offensive odor and had stains all over the carpet. While room #2 did not smell it still was filthy. And what's with the garage sale looking best up table in front of a nasty fake velvet couch?    Worse yet you're expected to sleep on the most uncomfortable bed you'll ever experience. A mattress on a 20 year old fold out couch would be an improvement!    Terrible room design and to top it off the walls and ceilings are so thin you will literally hear even the littlest sound made by your neighbors. The night we stayed apparently some parents left their kids including an infant alone until 3 am! Stuff being thrown against the walls and being broken and loud banging on our door and our neighbors doors then crying and screaming that went on and on. Front desk is completely worthless and simply does not care. The place is one giant contradiction. AVOID THE ROOMS and you should be fine.
50,The Park MGM is a wonderful non-smoking casino resort that is located by the NYNY resort. The staff is great and makes you feel welcome as a special guest. It is walking distance to many casinos easy access by car and near the 15 freeway.
20,Hallways are very dim with bubbled/loose carpet. Room and Bath was not very clean. Decor seems outdated unless you know they are going for a retro look. Billing error on final bill. Good thing is Nonsmoking facility - including casino.
20,We hoped to have a nice night in a suite but the rooms were very dated. Ceilings were less than 8 foot in places. They say no smoking casino but they didn't stop people. Room service messed up our order and so we waited almost an hour for the right food.
10,The worst room I have ever been to in Las Vegas. It’s ridiculous what type of disgusting room you give to your clients who are paying customers. With that in mind I expect a much better outcome from a hotel with this high-end luxury standard. Below zero if it was possible. Thank you.
30,The location is perfect for walking to almost everywhere that fancy your needs. The rooms are average and it does show it's wear. I couldn't tell if there was some sort of reside in the bathroom sink or not. I tried scrubbing it off and realized that the sink was showing the wear. MGM definitely hit the mark when it comes to check-in parking and other services. Be warned that if there's a sporting event in the area parking is a nightmare which obviously can't be helped. It definitely was disturbing to see minor sitting at the slot machines while their parents were no where to be found. Security needs to pay more attention to this! Overall it was a decent stay but there will always be drawback.
50,Clean comfortable friendly staff great for the price. It was easy to use to tram from The Park MGM to The Bellagio. We had a great time even though we didn’t spend a lot of time in our room. We had a view of the strip.
50,The view from my room was excellent nice location and the staff was very professional and polite the casino was different with no smoking allowed overall I am very happy with my stay and looking forward to staying again at the property
30,"The rooms are outdated. The walls are paper thin. THERE ARE NO MINI FRIDGES of any kind! C'mon this is the 21st century even Motel 6 has mini-fridges. This makes for a very dry thirsty stay. I was also was part of the Amex Hotel Collection where I got a $100 credit towards numerous places to eat and drink on the property. I was told at checkin that I just needed to use my Amex that they had on file and they would credit my charges up to $100. I didn't even use the full amount and they are not giving me the credit because they said I had to ""charge it to my room"". That is not what I was told and I have paper work given to me by them that doesn't state that as well. Now I have a dispute going. What a pain. Also the property is within steps of the T-Mobile arena. Stay away if the Vegas Knights are playing!!! Only good thing was every employee that we came in contact with was very nice."
20,Eataly is Excellent but the rest of MGM Park is not worth it. Found the room cheaply done. The hotel restaurants outrageously priced and the staff ordinary. Except for Housekeeping. They did a good job
50,Love non smoking hotel! You can easily get to Caesar’s for concerts TMobile belagio for dining or just stay at park mgm and enjoy smoke free facility. Nice pool! Love non smoking wish more would do same!
50,Enjoyed location on the strip and the smoke free casino and bar. The room was perfect and quiet. Every staff member I dealt with was very friendly and helpful. Definitely will to Vegas and stay at this hotel
20,I'm a Gold MGM Rewards member and at this property that means little. Other MGM properties will upgrade me the Park MGM never does. The property boasts some of the cities best food outlets. Who doesn't love the Nomad Library or Eataly but the beds at this hotel are awful. Even in their Wellness Rooms which have memory foam mattresses the beds are so uncomfortable. I don't know how you make a memory foam mattress uncomfortable but they have. Pillow are equally as awful. A hotel is only as good as the night sleep you get and it's hard to get one here.
50,This was my second stay at Park MGM and it likely won't be my last. I love the location of the hotel and that it's a bit smaller and less casino focused that the other hotels in Vegas. It also has amazing food and bar options right on site.
10,Rooms are outdated! Rooms are smelly! There was an “emergency” repair with hammering and drilling that woke us up at about 2am! Their best option intially was ear plugs and a $50 F&B credit! We eventually asked for and got our room changed to a different floor and the night comped.
50,This was a very welcome change from the smoke filled casinos where you could breathe and see without burning eyes. On the plus side the staff was enjoyable and took the time to explain different craps philosophies and rules while gambling. It was a great experience with this friendly environment.
50,Good food good people. Had a good time. Room was clean and they extended my stay for free when my flight was cancelled. Smoke free environment allows you to breath and casino smells good. Would recommend
50,Very nice sweet hotel to stay. The shower room is very clean love the hot water. If the noise isolation could be done better that will be much better. Plus if included shampoo in the bath will be great
50,If you looking for a clean. SMOKE FREE casino to play and stay this is the place. It 8s a middle-of-the-road the hotel good size rooms with decent amenities. The l9cation is great near a lot of the MGM hotels and Tmobile areana.
50,Great hotel easy check in and out only thing I would like more fast food access. Also don’t let me stay up so late. Lol. Went to bed at 5 am Loved the easy access check in and out. Parking was great. La La Noodle was awesome
10,Do not stay here. Casino lobby are nice non smoking. But rooms are old dated and dirty. Noise in dark dirty hallways all night. Location is fine old Monte Carlo property. Best thing about property is Eataly.
40,The hotel is located in a great are on the strip. The view for me was great. The room was small and certainly designed for no more than two people. The room appeared very clean and fresh. Housekeeping was efficient. The hallways smelled a little. A more contemporary color other than brown would be nicer too. Overall really good experience and I will definitely stay here again if the price is right.
30,The wall between rooms are thin. We can even hear the neighbor opening/closing curtains. Unfortunately we had a bunch of early 20s people stayed next to us. They had parties two nights in the row (at least 10 people in the room with loud music). We had to call front desk 3 times they sent security up but only told them to lower their voice. It's vegas not sure why people can't party at the club.
10,Park MGM should really either completely renovate this property or sell it because it’s not doing anything for the MGM Brand or Customer Experience. The rooms are dark caves with surface mounted wires running across the walls and ceiling. The bathroom and closet share the same barn door. The bed is uncomfortable at best.
40,Our stay at Park MGM all is fine our room is very big are very very very very very comfortable. I do not recommend anything at the Italian food court all of our food was very disappointing there. Customer service was excellent however staff very friendly
50,Great strip location. Non smoking hotel is a plus. The only complain is that the room door makes loud noise when closing. Hard to sleep when you can hear doors closing loudly. The room was clean and check in and out was a breeze. Reception staff was friendly.
40,The stay well suite was an amazing experience! I slept like a baby! It's one of the most comfortable hotel beds I've ever slept in. The shower was so soothing. Perfect after a vegas night! Well worth the upgrade!
20,"Mediocre experience. I was expecting a high end experience with MGM flair; I did not realize this was just the Monte Carlo with new branding. This was not a ""luxury"" or high end hotel and both my daughter and Mom were disappointed. Since we travelled during Christmas the room rates were super cheap so at least I didn't spend a lot on the room. Would not recommend to anyone"
50,Wonderful hotel that is pet friendly and non-smoking. Always enjoy staying at an MGM hotel. The hotel was clean and they have friendly staff. The location was on the strip and close enough to everything you need. I highly recommend!
50,Great location smoke free environment easy check in and out. Very friendly staff. Nice casino area with plenty of games and card tables. Parking structure is large and very easily accessible. Highly Recommend
50,I recommend the Park MGM because it’s non smoking; although a lot of cigarette smoke does blow in the doors or the north entrance and the valet door because the Park allows smoking right outside the doors. There needs to be a 25ft smoking rule outside the main entrances allowing the casino to be truly non smoking!
10,I would avoid this place if you can. They are a rude and unhappy bunch. I would rather stay at Piccolo Pete’s on state-line. Spend the extra few dollars and go to one of the hotels that does it right.
50,Great place to stay the check in was late that was the only issue other than that no complains the location it's great the room was perfect for the price. i would definitely recommend it to my family and friends I would stay here again.
50,This hotel feels very clean bright and cheery to me. The rooms were nice and I loved the non-smoking casino floor and the many restaurants to choose from.    One of my reasons for choosing a hotel over an Air BnB is for the gym access. This hotel had a pretty decent gym.    On the first day I got to the gym around 7:40am on a Saturday and easily snagged a treadmill. There were eight treadmills but one was out of service. The treadmills (the brand is True) were nice and were supposed to sync to my Apple Watch but I could never get that part to work. They also had wireless charging pads for phones which was great. It would have been nice if it was connected to TV (maybe it was and I couldn’t figure it out?) but it wasn’t a deal breaker.    The gym seemed to fill up by 9am that Saturday but the (working) treadmills were only filled up for a few minutes before someone ended their walk/run.    My Sunday workout was strength training. I got there a little earlier that day maybe around 7:15am but the gym filled up by 8ish. (Giving times for anyone who likes to avoid the crowds!)    There were two sets of heavy dumbbells (30 pounds and up) but only one set of light dumbbells (20 pounds or lower). I’m glad no one else needed the lighter weights since i likely would have had to wait for the tens or fifteens. (That’s happened at other hotel gyms before.)    At the end of my workout I peeked into a door marked office (it was wide open) and saw another set of light dumbbells there. I don’t know why they weren’t out in the main gym area. The office/closet also had some medicine balls that I wasn’t sure why they were tucked away.    There is a small area off to the right of the gym (actually just right of that office/closet) where one could do yoga or Pilates. I did some of my floor strength work in there. The gym has very thin very worn mats that seemed like their time had come. (There was a thicker mat but those thin ones are really ready to be retired.)    I didn’t use any of the strength machines but I did use one of the two weight benches.    The gym was stocked with hand towels a water dispenser and plenty of wet wipes to wipe down the machines. There were also plenty of ellipticals (I didn’t count how many but I never saw them fill up) and stationary bikes.    Overall I’d give the gym a thumbs up.
10,The rooms are horribly designed and not functional at all. There really is no real door to the bathroom and no desk under the T.V. but there is one in the middle of the room. The housekeeper really didn't clean our room the first night and the towels were very rough. The bath products were terrible.
50,Very nice and peaceful hotel for family occasions. The food and beverage family are very accommodating. Truly PARK MGM is another home away from home. I just hope more food places is open late . And bar should have appetizers menu atleast.
20,The make-up mirror is the worst! If you can't provide something that works get rid of it.  No exhaust fan in the bathroom?!?!? Are you kidding?  Leaky shower door seal...water all over the floor.  Dirty men's underwear in the safe! Doesn't anyone check the safes to make sure they're empty when the prior guest leaves???  Ladies ponytail holders and bobby pins on the floor near the base of the bed. Who vacuums???  No refrigerator??? Seriously??  No coffee maker??? Are you kidding??  The television was significantly smaller than the frame affixed to the walk.  This room was a disappointment from top to bottom. It looked like the cheapest room at Motel 6.  On the positive side the casino renovation was very nice (too many progressive slots though). Water pressure in the shower was great.  Eataly was nice but WAY over priced!
50,A quick trip to Vegas for golf and a Golden Knights game was the perfect stop at Park MGM. Easy in-and-out along with a quick walk across the street for the hockey game. Highly recommend the SMOKE FREE Park MGM to anyone staying in Las Vegas!
40,Wonderful smaller casino very clean and welcoming. Beds were comfy and room well appointed. Great shower with amazing pressure! Non-smoking property is a wonderful change and made playing there very enjoyable.
40,Based on just 1 night stay. Check in and check out was quick hotel and room was clean. Really liked that the entire hotel was smoke-free. Overall had a good experience. Would consider staying here again the next time in Vegas.
50,Clean environment. Fresher air quality. Incredible staff: very helpful friendly kind and understanding. Checkin and Check-out process was extremely easy. Various restaurants to choose from and food tastes amazing.
30,Park MGM is a nice hotel the Nighthawk Suite was not a great value as there is no mini fridge the water pressure in the shower sucks and the TV's take minutes (yes minutes) to load up to watch. Visit Eately it is a cool Italian experience.
50,Lovely stay. Staff was awesome. Room was nice. Love this being a non smoking casino/hotel. Easy access to Allegiant Stadium. Only con are the resort fees. They always seem excessive for what doesn’t feel like a resort.
50,Another great trip to the Park. This was the first since the plague and we felt right at home as we always do and we’re thrilled to see the high standard of service remained consistent. Updated rooms were refreshing.
30,Room was given not cleaned and when it was reported to front desk they just blew it off as if it wasn't said. They also frequently bill for the room snacks when none of them were taken and you need to file a dispute to have the charges taken off
50,Beautiful Hotel/Casino In the heart of this trip I used the free tram more times that I can remember it’s a beautiful property with lots of art work everywhere the rooms though nor large  are very comfortable and well appointed every member of the staff went out of their way to make my stay memorable
50,"We had a great time at Park MGM. We got better than expected rooms even for a basic ""Two Queen"" room on the 17th floor. The VIP desk is well-staff and well-informed to help MGM Rewards guests. Convenient location with a free tram that (slowly) takes you from the Aria (follow the indoor causeway) to the Bellagio."
30,We have stayed here twice both times were for concerts nearby. Location to venues (T-Mobile Arena & Dolby Arena) is fantastic! No car needed. EATALY food options and having the large Starbucks inside the hotel are an added plus. The hotel’s on-location Fed Ex shipping store gave options for shipping out Christmas gifts we purchased. Rooms were clean quiet & comfortable— nothing special—but we spent minimal time in our room so that was fine. We stay here for the amazing location to the music venues. Walk out the door and T-Mobile Arena is RIGHT THERE!
30,It was a good experience overall except our room condition as mentioned in previous slides. I hope if I come back again I do not face the same issue I faced during my trip. I enjoyed at casino and had good time. However I had to stay out of my room cause of faulty air conditioning system.
50,Lots of great food options. The rooms are a bit small as it is a older building. Rooms are nice and updated. Monorail makes it easy to get around to other casinos. Bavettes in the MGM park is a must try on the strip service is excellent.
50,The Park doesn’t look like anything fancy from the outside but once you get inside the Italian theme will impress you. The cocktail bar made great drinks. We ordered delicious sandwiches for lunch from the Eatily. The smoke free facility was a welcome change (even the casino was smoke free). The elevators were very fast with minimal wait time. The room was simple & tastefully decorated. Pillows and the bed were comfortable. I was very happy they had plenty of USB outlets & an an outlet on each night stand. The long sofa & conference table in the room was a pleasant surprise so we had plenty of seating space and didn’t have to sit on the bed. The TV was mounted in the wall but swiveled out. It was easy to angle from the sofa or bed. It’s a beautiful facility with friendly staff.
50,Great staff great location super clean room! Casino is great too and had great tables games and low minimums early in the day too. Pillows and bedding were super fresh and comfortable. Shower and bathroom also A+!
40,Great place with excellent staff. Just needs your slots to pay out. Even small pots but pay out. I love the non smoking casino and the great restaurants. Housekeeping is on their game. I hope you pay them what they are worth
50,Location was great. This was a girlfriend trip and we all had a great stay. Food was great. Did not win any money but overall we all had a magnificent time. I would suggest more of a night life like a band or some kind of live music for grown folks.
40,I always enjoy staying at Park MGM; this stay could have been better if the room was cleaner. The staff and casino is pleasant. The Casino is smoke free which is always a plus. You can’t go wrong with the location
30,Service was very average not particularly friendly mostly indifferent. Paid for a suite…huge room but not as nice as we’d expected for the price. Carpet was hideous. Room was very clean I’ll give it that. Great location if you’re going to a Knights game
40,My room was pretty well maintained and the staff was great but to my surprise there was not microwave mini fridge or bathtub in the room. I don't think I have ever stayed in a hotel in Las Vegas that did not have any of those!
50,Had an amazing trip. We love staying at the Park MGM. No smoking Hotel definitely A PLUS. Friendly service and staff. Suite are nice and clean. plenty of slots to pick from. We are mostly roulette players. Dealer are So friendly and love when they remember us from last trip.
30,AC was broken outlets didn’t work water pressure was low - had to use spa just to get ready. Hotel property was nice and amenities were great but it was hard to feel comfortable and be in the room with so many issues.
50,Very laid back and great for hockey fans looking to be at the center of it all. great casino and great rooms with a variety of great food! Really makes you feel like you’re on a getaway. Makes you feel welcomed and so many nice people to meet
40,Staff friendly rooms extremely clean great views great slots choices and amazing food options. Only reason this didn’t get a higher rating was because of the annoying parking garage the app or key did not work for me. Also house keeping had woken me up on my last night stay  when guest services was advised they apologized and that’s about it.
10,If you can find another hotel DO IT! Definitely wasn't worth the price and the stench was even in the room. Really was an uncomfortable stay and I'm just relieved it was just for 2 nights. Bc of the events going on this weekend we couldn't find another hotel unfortunately. Do yourself a favor and DO NOT STAY HERE
30,This hotel is conveniently located on the Las Vegas strip. However it is a renovated old hotel so the decor really shows that. Fairly low ceilings. Older looking rooms. The rooms are extremely sparse. They don’t even have a coffee machine. I think if you’re travelling to Vegas on a budget this is a hotel you might want to consider. If however you’re hoping to experience Las Vegas rooms that you see on shows this is not the place to stay. I have to say though that the beds are quite comfortable. The shower and the water pressure are excellent.
50,Short trip but exceptional service. Great value and casino experience was pleasant. Not drowning in the overpowering smell of smoke! Rooms were clean and spacious! Quiet atmosphere; a great place for those trying to escape the hustle and bustle of the Vegas crowd!
50,We loved that this was a smoke free casino! It made me want to stay on the floor for a longer period of time! We loved the location on the strip’ everything was easy to get to. The restaurants and Bar in the Park MGM were all awesome as well!
50,Clean room. Check in was super easy. No lines to wait in at all with electronic check in. The Eataly area had so much food to choose from. The rib eye was to die for! Pizza and salads were great. We will be back.
50,Our room was cleaned daily which is a plus. Checked in and out with no issues and a minimal wait time. I liked the variety of restaurants and gaming options. Close to other points of interest on the strip.
50,We just returned from our first trip after many to Las Vegas staying at the Park MGM. We typically stay at higher end resorts but decided this trip to stay at the Park MGM. The service was fantastic the staff was friendly and accommodating the room was clean as well as the rest of the hotel. Our room was quiet which is important to us. The shower was spectacular as well. Location is nice and easy to get to various parts of the strip whether by walking or by the tram. Give it a try you won’t be disappointed.
50,Loved to be able to breathe without smoke. Tables were good. Good energy empployees. Francisco on the roulette table was awesome. Love that there are tvs to be able to watch spots wile playing at the tables.
50,Been staying here since the preview days when it switched over from Monte Carlo. Love the hotel - not too big but not too small. Non smoking casino floor is the best part for me. Food options are decent. Staff is friendly hotel is clean. Location is ideal for me. Rooms are nice. Just wish you didn't hear your neighbor opening or closing their blinds every time if you happen to be in your room - not sure why that is even a thing.
30,Rooms not clean. Bell hop was rude. I guess he expected me to tip him when he took our bags to the back to hold for 30 min. Little did he know that I would once I cashed out my chips. Didn't have cash on me. Gave the tip to his partner when we picked up our stuff. I would've asked for better accommodations but I didn't want to make a big fuss.
30,The room was dirty. We found debris on the floor. The drinking glasses were filthy. The Primrose restaurant food quality was very low. I've stayed at Park many times on the past and had no issues I'm not sure what changed.
50,Modern rooms pool and hot tub open during off season and close to other bopping MGM properties. We had a great time !! We loved playing between the park and NYNY which was right next door. We had strip view and a nice stand up shower!
50,Park MGM is my favorite in Las Vegas. It is clean has been modernized upgraded and expanded all to the good. And the entire facility is no smoking which is a plus for me. I walked in other resorts and the smoke smell is horrible! And Park MGM pumps in a fragrance which is great. I highly recommend and will stay there on my next trip to LasVegas.
50,Loved the smoke free environment. Reasonable weekday prices. Close to other great restaurants casinos and the tram. Rooms were updated especially the bathrooms. Definitely Would stay again for sure.
40,Great place for the weekend. Not a big fan of the green color. The beds area very comfortable and water pressure is fantastic. The location if very convenient for professional football and hockey and other casinos.
20,My recent stay at the Park MGM was observably mediocre.    The staff was rude the rooms were cramped & uncomfortable and the non-smoking policy make one feel like they're staying at a daycare instead of a Las Vegas Casino...    There are many other hotel options in Las Vegas. Do yourself a favor and avoid the Park MGM...
40,We love the Park MGM. Great atmosphere rooms are modern and nice very good restaurants and The Eataly section is very cool! However if you have a mini bar in your room avoid it like the plague unless you are independently wealthy! We picked out a bottle of Fiji water then checked the price list…$18.00 for about a 16 oz bottled water! Looking through the rest of the price list was equally unbelievable. If you are thinking of something from the mini bar be sure and scan the QR code for the price list! There is a store in the lobby where the prices are much more reasonable for drinks and snacks.
10,Not sure why my first post was deleted... Our experience was pretty terrible from the start. Our flight was cancelled & rebooked for the next day so when I called to cancel our first night I was told we would be charged zero compassion for the situation we were in. It was a Monday night not a weekend anything. Fine it is what it is. Next day when we finally arrived we had booked a strip view room but none with a king bed were available so Dustin put is in a room with 2 queens. That wouldn't have been a big deal but the room was filthy. Empty beer bottles nut shells slippers & beds that looked slept in in the living room dried up contact lenses used tooth brush etc in the bathroom. Called down to the front desk explained what happened were told they changed our room cards gave us new room number told us we could go straight there. Tried keys wouldn't work went down to the front desk. We were given new keys to the new room. Went up to the new room it was also dirty. Hand/face prints on the windows drink rings around the couch some substance on the couch that looked like snot splatters all over the mirrors in the bathroom and living area stains on the pillow cases. Called front desk again was told they would send up the housekeeping supervisor. We waited. In the mean time we're unable to shower and get ready to meet up with our friends. While we waited a maintenance guy came into our room without knocking. No idea anyone was in there. He left. Still waiting another housekeeper comes into the room without knocking again no idea we were in there either. Not the housekeeping supervisor. We call down to the front desk again we're told that no one put in a call to the housekeeping supervisor and that they will do that now. Housekeeping supervisor (Lissett) eventually shows up we show her the issues with the room she gives us a $25 drink credit & let us know the front desk would be calling to advise on next steps. Front desk called (Brenda) advised they were going to move us to an upgraded room but that it wasn't ready at the moment. We explained that we were waiting to go meet our friends she said to go & when we come back to call down they would send someone up with the keys and to move our stuff to the new room. When we came back we called they sent someone up we moved rooms. Great. Finally got to shower & get ready for our night out. We'd left the room but I came back up to get my jacket see our door wide open & yet another house keeper in our room who again has no idea someone is supposed to be in there and says this room is due to be checked out. Didn't check my ID or ask anyone and just let me take my jacket. I literally could have been anyone and taken anything. At point we've been dealing with room issues from 9:30AM and this is now 7:30PM ish. We went out & decided to deal with this in the morning because we were sick of it at this point. Go out get back to our room I check the MGM app & it says we're checking out in the morning (Wednesday). Great except we're supposed to be checking out on Saturday. So after going out until 2 we now needed to set our alarm for early because we now need to make sure they don't check us out first thing. We decided we needed to speak to a manager at this point because we have never had an issue like this in any hotel we've stayed. In fact I've never even left a review before. So after a long night out we get up early and head down to the front desk & ask for a manager. Ace comes over to speak with us we go through the whole speil again & he fixes the reservation gives us new keys and offers a $150 food & beverage credit. Doesn't explain that it doesn't show up on the bill at all or that we need to keep track to know if we've used it doesn't explain what it includes or doesn't include. Whatever at this point we're just happy that we don't have to deal with the room issues again because it's taken up a ridiculous amount of our vacation at this point. At checkout on Saturday we decided to go to the desk to checkout and spoke with Lexi the night auditor. We decided not to do mobile checkout because we were concerned that the food and beverage credit wasn't used properly & we were correct. The only thing that showed was our Starbucks charges but no others which made no sense as we had used it other places turns out they're on our bills they didn't get applied to the food and beverage credit we were told they would take off 2 nights of resort fees to cover the difference. Unsure if this actually occurred because we weren't given the proper print out at the time and the app doesn't show our stuff now. This hotel messed up multiple days of our trip was terrible at explaining things including how to use the free play credits I had or that I needed a pin so I had to go to the rewards desk multiple times. We have been to Vegas numerous times between us and our friends over the years and have never experienced anything like this gong show. We honestly don't even know what we were billed for at this point or how much we've been charged because nothing is adding up. We have multiple charges on our card & are completely confused. We had been told by several friends that this was a great place to stay so had high hopes. Huge disappointment an incredibly frustrating & honestly stressful experience. We will definitely not be back to the Park & will tell our friends and family the same.
10,My room smelled like sewage. I went to the desk and the associate didn't seem surprised to hear the complaint about the smell or offer an apology for the inconvenience. I was moved to a different floor my reservation is for a king but apparently the only thing available in the entire property (??) is two queens. No assistance was offered in moving my luggage to a different floor. Just disappointed in Park MGM as a whole. Is this acceptable sewage smells in guest rooms? It's given me a headache because the stench was so strong. Frankly it has ruined the start of my trip.
40,Stayed here for my friends wedding at a off strip location. The resort is pretty central to wherever you’d like to go on the strip. Plenty of places to eat at the resort. Enjoyed having a smoke free casino.
50,No Smoking casino is a big plus. Great location and Eatly is convenient to grab a quick bite. Easy walking distance to Aria and free tram to Bellagio. The sportsbook is nice and they have great concerts at the arena next to the casino.
30,I really wanted to love this place...but....  it started with check in..The woman who checked us in was very annoyed with the couple of questions we asked her and acted like she didn't want to be there. I felt like they put everyone who stayed at this hotel in the same tower on floors 23 to 28 because there was always a loooong wait for the elevators going up and down and then everyone tried to pack into one elevator like sardines. Finally got to the room after waiting about 15 mins. The elevators are dirty along with the hallway. Garbage everywhere. The room was ok. 2 queen beds which I felt were pretty low to the ground. A sofa that had some questionable stains on it. No mini fridge. I suggest that you bring slippers because the carpet is so gross/black and dirty. The bathroom was semi clean there were some hairs in the shower (not mine) and the sink was stained with I don't know what. I called housekeeping for more towels but after waiting for an hour and a half we had to go dinner. Towels never came.  The casino is smoke free which is great. Eataly is great. Lala Noodle is great. 3 star review for that.  I was so excited to stay here but now I think we will just stick with Caesar's properties as this hotel was disappointing.
30,The beds are extremely comfortable. Room is very average. Clean but no frills. There is not a refrigerator in room which I tend to expect. Casino is ok. We only eat once at hotel. New York New York across the street offers a lot more. And make sure you don’t book on arena side during game day. Fog horn blasts are loud!
30,Check in through mobile app was excellent. The room we had didn’t have a closet so it was hard getting out luggage out of the way. Not a lot of tables open durning the day. The limit on the tables were a bit high.
50,Had a great time with Flora and Jean at the blackjack tables! They kept me laughing all night and made me want to keep coming back for more. I also enjoy the fact that it was a smoke free resort. Great place to play.
50,I am surprised at how nice this hotel was considering the very fair price of rooms. Dining gaming drinking and Eataly make Park MGM have a ton to offer. Hotel casino restaurants and front lobby are centrally located so you don’t need to walk 20+ minutes to get around like a lot of other resorts on the strip. Met a ton of friendly staff all around who made our stay fun and welcoming. Everything was very clean and housekeeping was always prompt. My favorite stay in Vegas yet was thanks to Park MGM!
20,Bathroom had many issues. Sink was clogged and had hair and black liquid come up from the drain. The carpet was sticky. Toilet lever did not work properly and the would only flush intermittently. Overall the room I stayed in needs a lot of work done.
40,I did leave something in the room still waiting on the item being returned. It is a forever voicemail. I wish they would have a dedicated person to help. The bathroom and closet door is a barn door so it is not sound proof and definitely can lead to a few embarrassing moments if you are looking for privacy this might not be your place. I do love the non smoking. That is the greatest thing about this hotel.
50,We have been staying at The Park since 2018 and love it. Now that it is completely smoke free we love it even more. It is a great location if you are attending an event at TMobile. As with most of the Strip properties there is a resort fee which I am not happy about but most of them charge it so what are you going to do. I enjoy The Park and when it is warmer weather the pool is great too.
50,I love this hotel. Excellent service. Convenient location with easy access to the Aria Tram. Lovely modern decor with a variety of art/photography. Best part? Smoke-free throughout ... yes even the casino.
20,What can I say the place was ok it was close to Eataly which we hit up a few times. It was mid strip so we could venture up or down visiting other properties. I was in Vegas for work and stayed a few extra days it's not a place I'd vacation.
50,Pan was by far the most energetic and kind BJ dealer. She helped us bring home the bacon and we had such a great time! Table games at MGM Park were so relaxing and even the pit boss was having a grand time with us! We will definitely be back!
50,Our stay at Park MGM was great. Took my wife to Vegas for her first time and she enjoyed her stay at Park MGM.staff was very friendly and helpful. Rooms were clean and quiet. The restaurants were very clean and well staffed.
50,We love that this hotel is non smoking and my husband liked the spa area.  We also love the selection of eateries they have and how close the Park MGM to everything. We also took the tram for the first time it was easy to locate.
30,Our room smells like sewage. For three days we smelt it. I called the desk. They said they had no more rooms. The maintenance guy was nice. He gave us a voucher for dinner because they knew there was a problem.
40,I had been to Park MGM and eaten in the “Eataly” area (if you like Italian it’s great). This was first time to stay. Liked it better than other MGM properties. It was Cleaner than the others and the staff was super nice. The location isn’t bad either especially if there is an event at T-mobile
30,Room was great. MGM rewards desk person was not helping me with my free play. Wi fi was not working. Front desk did not care if it was working on not. Front desk gave me another 800 number to call for wifi issue. It took 4 hours or so to fix the issue
20,Room smelled bad small couldn’t sleep much at night took forever for cocktails server to bring our drinks casino host not helpful at all. Disappointed over all. I prior going back with Caesars Entertainment.
20,Don't go by the MGM brand. The hotel lacks basic amenities:  1. No refrigerator or microwave  2. No bath tub  3. No free overnight parking    Rooms and cleanliness is average. No great restaurants as well in the hotel. We almost always went to Aria nearby for lunches and dinner.
50,Everything was fine  My Husband and I have an Awesome time with our Business Partners. No issues at all. I liked the bed mostly! I would most definitely recommend you all to everyone we know. We will be back again.
50,I have stayed here before and the Park MGM has become a favorite destination with its generous sized casino and non-smoking policy. The guest rooms are very comfortable as well. I would like to see more dining options but they do offer a few
40,We enjoyed our stay overall. The room was a little underwhelming but fine. I didn't like the bed I prefer a much firmer mattress. I enjoyed the smoke free aspect and the casino size. Pretty good restaurants but limited choices. Quick walk to additional at Aria.  Check in was a breeze using the mobile option and well as the mobile key.  It's a really convenient location and easy parking for self parking option
50,First time in Vegas. Although I went to see Aerosmith and Steven was sick so the concerts were canceled we enjoyed our trip anyway. MGM Park--I will stay there every time. I enjoyed the smoke free environment the quieter casino and lobby area. Easy to get around with Uber. All hotel personnel were extremely friendly and very helpful. Room was quiet and very clean. Shower was excellent!! Will recommend to anyone who asks where to stay in Vegas.
30,Park MGM's location and staff are the two biggest reasons I would consider staying here again. The staff was super friendly and hospitable in every interaction we had. The location is nice because you're within a 15-minute walk of either Bellagio or Mandalay Bay with plenty of stuff in between.    However we were really disappointed with a few things on the property and it's enough to make us question staying there again. On the last two nights of our trip there was no place inside the hotel to get snacks or drinks to take to the room after 10 p.m. The store in the lobby was closed and the tiny store inside the casino was also shuttered. Even a Holiday Inn has a small place to buy soda and candy bars from...    There was no refrigerator in our standard room but you could rent one for a daily fee. The ice machine on our floor was broken and because you have to scan your room key to get off on a desired floor you can't just run down to the floor below. When I called the front desk they were helpful and delivered ice in a plastic bag for me. But with no place to keep it cold obviously it all melted in about 30 minutes...    The hallways are extremely dark and dreary. It feels like something out of a horror movie.    If you're a gambler the casino itself is basic and probably the worst gaming property on that side of town (we played at every MGM property aside from Mirage). Not many newer games and a limited variety of what they do have.    If you just need a place to crash each night you can do a lot worse than Park MGM especially considering the price. But if you want any sort of elevated experience in your stay I would recommend a different property.
50,Great place too stay. If you value your stay stay out of any CESAR'S PROPERTY ESPECIALLY THE FLAMINGO as I must write 200 characters. The Flamingo refused a handicapped person a seat. I was told to walk to the casino. I was then told
50,We stayed at Park MGM for our second time and it did not disappoint! Clean safe and incredibly friendly and competent staff! Location is excellent also! Many restaurants on-site and great casino bar!
50,Great service in a clean smoke free environment. Eataly is good could use more food selection but what is there was very good quality and taste a little pricey. Casino was clean good drink service at the machines. Would go back
40,We enjoy staying at Park MGM and/or Nomad for several reasons.  1) SMOKE FREE Resort  2) Good clean rooms  3) Great staff. MGM has been very good to us since we started going to Vegas about 10 years ago.    Only reason I gave a 4 out of 5 is because I would want to save a 5 out of 5 for places like Aria and Bellagio but Park/Nomad is much better place to stay than most resorts on the strip.
20,Poor housekeeping (vacuuming picking up trash making the bed). Broken bedside lamp and outlets leading to tripping hazard for cords going to medical equipment. Repeated follow ups with front desk required to obtain promised food and beverage credit. Parts of hotel showed their age (carpets in particular). Very disappointed.
40,Very nice hotel and great location. The staff was helpful and very friendly. The room was adequate. The bed was comfy. It was nice that the pool/hot tub is open year round. I loved the location close to T-Mobile arena where we attended UFC also close to shows many restaurants and fun attractions. I will be back!
40,I chose to stay at the Park MGM this visit to Vegas as the property is non-smoking. The rooms are pretty basic and simple which was fine for us as we don't spend a great deal of time in our hotel room. They are very clean and updated and the property is lovely. If you are looking for a more luxury Vegas hotel however this might not be the best option for you but we really enjoyed the property and our stay so we would definitely stay again!
30,It was an ok stay even we booked using American Express Travel . They was trying to overcharge me and try not to provide me with the benefits I am supposed to have with Platinum American Express Card .
50,Friendly staff non-smoking many options for food....great hotel! Wish some of the table games had lower minimums during the day but all-in-all. There is no coffee in the rooms and they are the new 'style' of rooms we see often now. I plan to stay here again!
30,"This was our second stay at Park MGM. We received an upgraded room to a Nighthawk Suite this time and were excited to see what the room looked like. Unfortunately the room looked similar to our previous standard room but larger. It had an additional TV and mini couch in front of the TV. Other than that no big deal. Since we didn't watch any TV on our vacation the additional ""2nd TV"" made no difference to us. So besides being roomier nothing special.    Positives:  - Bavette's Restaurant was GREAT. A must go to. It is a higher priced restaurant but well worth it!  - Casino is non-smoking. Perfect!  - Convenient location. Can easily get to other hotels quickly.    Negatives:  - Fitness center is small and limited  - Casino had issues accepted our MGM reward cards. MGM customer service desk was horrible and rude.  - Primrose restaurant was disappointing. Customer service was poor and very pricey!  - Overall customer service that we experienced was poor. Unfriendly and unhelpful. Only Bavette's had superior customer service.    This will probably be our last stay at this hotel in Vegas. We much prefer Aria."
30,The main reason it was a 3 star score was that it was a huge hassle to get into valet because you had to exit out from the check in driveway and drive around and re enter to get to valet: and the bathroom was dirty.
20,The hotel was clean and ok and on the strip the rooms are very basic and small. The check-in young lady took my anejo patron unopened alcohol bottle and never returned it to the lost and found. Not many choices of restaurants and it is supposed to be a smoke free hotek but it used to be the Monte Carlo and very smoky before they remodeled It still has a dmell to the rooms.
30,The hallways and carpet need brightened up. Dark green is drab old and depressing. The rest of Park is nice bright and vibrant. But the floors are dark. Also make the parking free. Put something nice on roof of casino so Views are better.
40,We originally decided to stay here because we were seeing a concert at the Dolby Live for Aerosmith. When the concert was cancelled we just kept the reservation. Staff was friendly and helpful. Amenities--casino is small but has just about everything you would want. Eataly was very unique. We booked the nighthawk suite. Room was very spacious and clean. A couple of issues that reduced my review by one star. Room is dated. Lighting has exposed wires tacked along the ceiling. Carpet is very old--needs replaced and furniture is out of style. Bathroom includes limited essentials and no exhaust fan or heat light. And the view was terrible. Paying extra for a suite you expect a nice view. I had 7th floor in the back with only a view of the taxi stand. Overall a nice stay. Casino and restaurants are very modern I do not know why they have not done basic room upgrades.
30,I stayed at the Montecarlo few times in the past because I liked the location and affordable rates. I was thinking that the recent remodeling would bring an upgrade in the room amenities and customer service but that wasn't the case. Some improvements yes but they could have done better. This place seems also to attract a very red neckish clientele ;)
50,Upon checking in we were told no rooms were ready despite paying for early check-in due to a large event the night before. We were told to wait and we would receive an email or text when our room was ready. After an hour or so of killing time and spending money we didn't want to spend we returned to a new check-in assistant who wasn't sure why we were held up and got us in a room straight way it was a twin Queen rather than King but a room is a room to us- a majorly frustrating start. Despite this initial hiccup we went on to enjoy our 4 night stay at Park MGM.    The rooms were lovely and modern large clean and practical with all the amenities you'd expect. We were on a low floor but had a great view over to NYNY and the T-Mobile arena. The hotel itself isn't our favourite for gambling (or drinking come to think of it) but we always really appreciated returning into the smoke free environment and would recommend it on that basis. We made good use of the free shuttle to Bellagio which is a big plus for this hotel in my opinion.    This was our third time in Vegas but our first time enjoying a pool day which we found very relaxing and the great food and drinks at this pool bar also helped. Overall I'd not return but I will certainly stick with MGM properties as I like the atmosphere and high quality rooms we have experienced. I'm hoping other hotels will follow this smoke-free example as this was a huge plus point for the property.
30,Nice Hotel a bit more of a budget choice that some of the nearby casinos. Still really nice though and great location. I wish the casino floor would have been bigger but the inside connection to the Aria was great.
10,The room was smelly stuffy and the shower water pressure sucked ! We checked out early and transferred to the Cosmo best decision ever. Honestly it’s worth spending the extra couple bucks for the comfort especially if you’re staying for a couple of days
30,Overall property was fine like usual had an issue with the room that made me doubt that the linens were clean the issue was not resolved and I was not compensated appropriately in my opinion. I always stay at this hotel and was very disappointed.
40,We picked this place because it’s smoke free and I (Jill) has asthma. But we loved where it was located on the strip. Loved the restaurants and the back “Eatily” (Italian themed area). The staff was amazing. The room could use an upgrade especially the window coverings. So hard to lift both coverings and loud. We could hear when the rooms next to us lifted and lowered theirs and I’m sure vice versa. And BIG bummer there was no coffee in the room and the Starbucks downstairs had very long lines in the mornings. I need my morning coffee! Downstairs bars could have used a little more entertainment aspect about them. But they were nice. We had hoped for an upgrade since it was our 35th anniversary and both our 60 birthdays but they said none was available. Not their fault but we loved our upgrade ten years prior when we stayed at the palazzo casino down the strip. But it’s the chance you take. All and all we loved our stay and will be back. The smoke free aspect wins us over!!! Most important to us I could breathe.
50,The rooms were large clean and quiet. The beds and pillows were comfortable. All of the staff we encountered were very friendly and helpful. Check-in process was quick and easy and room was ready on time.
50,Second time staying here!! Location is fantastic DolbyLive is in the hotel smoke-free casino and room a nice (nothing stellar about the rooms but it’s Vegas and you’re likely sleeping if your in your room so I don’t need super fancy)
50,Eataly is awesome.  Smoke free casino  Friendly staff  Hotel is across the street from TMoblile Stadium so perfect location for hockey games.  Good variety of bars and restaurants from casual to high end.  On the Record nightclub is fun - check out the speakeasy inside if you can find it 😉
50,Amazing dealers and floor staff. Specifically PAN! She was an incredible dealer for us that made the gambling experience the most fun we have ever experienced. She was so friendly and would visit just to see her again! Another dealer named Janet was awesome as well. And Ian the pit boss at the time really cared for the dealers and the players at the tables and our experience. We love Pan!    Tim B
40,We were at the Park MGM during NFR. It was much quieter and pleasant than the other hotels we visited like Caesar's and the Bellagio. I had previously stayed at the MGM Grand and I liked the Park MGM way more. It is easier to navigate not smoky and generally more mellow. However the trade off is there isn't much there. I enjoyed the Fitness Center. I did not enjoy our room. It didn't have a closet (instead a wardrobe) the shower was terrible and we had a crying baby next to us the entire time. That being said... we did not complain. Frankly I just didn't have time. The app is poor too.
50,I have a conference in early December every year at the Park MGM & the Monte Carlo before then. I like the rooms and the customer service that MGM Resorts provides. But being smoke free is the main reason that I come back again and again!!
50,Great location friendly staff and so much to do. Property is smoke free which I didn’t think matter until I stepped in other casinos. The mgm rewards desk was very accommodating. Also loved that you could order all food on the app to have ready for pickup
50,"Im more concerned about my tier credits barely budging after I've spent a lot more on this trip than my last. I'm confident that I should have been gold after this especially since tier credits were ""doubled"" during this time period."
40,Parking was a challenge as we arrive during an event. The door for the closet doubles as a door for the bathroom. Bed was uncomfortable. The escalator was not functioning when we left. We were unable to find an elevator had to carry our luggage up all the stairs. On a positive note the staff were all very nice and friendly and helpful wait times were short at checkin. We usually stay at the Excalibur and I did not feel that the increased cost of the room was worth the money.
50,Comfortable beds clean and spacious rooms nice views of the strip. The entire resort is non-smoking and it makes all the difference. Good food available from Eataly but it is ridiculously expensive and the employees are not friendly. We spent $60.00 on 2 coffees 2 breakfast sandwiches and 2 pastries for breakfast 😳. Seems unreasonable.
50,By far my favorite hotel and casino to stay at while in Vegas. Great hotel with tons of restaurants. Great food service rooms and amenities. We stay here just about every time we come to Vegas. You could spend a weekend in Vegas at the Park MGM and never have to leave your hotel. There's that much to do.
50,Very nice rooms excellent staff The Italian food court/marketplace Eataly was amazing! Nice smaller size casino great speakeasy at On The Record overall on our top 3 stays in Vegas we will be back!
40,Reasonably well done for a remodel and I would return due to amenities and location. I was disappointed that we couldn't dine at Babettes due to availability. Rooms were average and some technical issues with the electronic room keys with our phones.
50,Perfect spot to stay to catch the game. Short walk or trolly ride to the stadium. Upscale but affordable. Clean! Great restaurants inside no smoking casino! 200 characters is a dumb minimum. Will stay again.
30,Finishing up a 3 day stay at Park MGM hotel. The staff are all wonderful and helpful. Absolutely love the non-smoking casino and will probably gamble only here when in Las Vegas. The rooms have very comfortable beds and pillows but the hotel really failed when it comes to soundproofing. Walking down the hall you can hear every tv that is on. In my room I can hear tv on either side and when neighbors open/shut their roman shade it sounds like it is right next to me. Really too bad that when they remodeled this hotel soundproofing wasn't a priority.
50,great location directly across from the hockey arena great amenities and best of all no smoking! Be sure to get reservations for breakfast or you’ll be headed to the strip. our room was relaxing had a great view and was quiet. Easy cab rides to the football stadium and thomas and mack. The tram is a short walk to the Mgm grand to get out to the convention centre. a quick trip to the airport
30,Very nice hotel. Good location. Lala noodle was great and had an amazing steak. Size of room was a little small. Our maid did a great cleaning job. Loved that it was pet friendly. Went to “on the record” and had a great time but couldn’t sit anywhere without having a reservation.
50,I visited the Vegas area to watch the New York Rangers Hockey game versus the Golden Knights. I have previously tied making a game but the traffic is tough to navigate on game night. Staying at the Park MGM made this a 100% better experience. Highly recommended if you are taking in an event at T Mobile Arena.
40,Enjoyed the stay only didn’t understand how or why I was being charged for a movie I didn’t order besides that I had a ball and would recommend people to stay there and I also love the fact it’s smoke free
50,The room was great awesome bed! Hotel staff was awesome. And NO SMOKING in the casino! So nice to not have to smell smoke on the casino floor. Lots of great restaurants and the live entertainment in the NoMad bar was really great!
50,Hotel is a great place to stay. The beds sit lower to the ground that i prefer. The hotel is within close walking distance to many things to do and places to eat. the staff was very helpful with any questions we had.
30,Loved the fact that this facility is entirely smoke free including the casino but for over $300/night I expected more from the room. Nicely laid out but bathroom needs sprucing up and no coffee machine. Hallways to room pretty dingy.
10,I especially chose this hotel for a strip view room and location but the room is really mediocre and the view is just a claim (seeing a corner of the strip only). Even though the Italian Eatery provided a lot of food options at night (not opening for breakfast) the evening traffic in the hotel is surprisingly very low compared with other casinos. I was wondering why the business was so bad until I saw the check-out charges. I was charged with $120 resort fee at the time dropping my key but my credit card was posted $288 after coming home. There is only $18 a day (I stayed for two days) for the parking. You don't even know how they would charge so much and what they charge for. Nobody has time to go back to argue with the hotel. I have been traveling for a week staying in 5 different hotels. This is the only hotel overcharging afterward. I will never stay in this casino anymore and won't recommend anybody staying in this hotel
50,We enjoyed our time at the Park MGM property. The shows casino and variety of restaurants at great. It's a huge property and would take days to enjoy all the amenities and different show options. It's beside the T Mobile arena if you are looking for a room after a show.
40,Hotel was nice but room was hot with no success fixing it. Attempted to get a fan or AC fixed but ended up having to go buy a fan myself. Was told a fan would be provided twice and that maintenance would come but neither happened
10,"We had checked in to our room that night and we experienced bad odor though by the very next day it would have gone away but no smell was still there called front office they said they will send someone up to check on it no one came up to check called the very next day still no one came figured by now smell would have gone away called for the very next time still no one came to check on us  smell have gotten so bad that for the next couple of days we just stayed out of out hotel only went back to take a shower and sleep odor was so bad it smelt like some one had taken a big old ""cow dump"" on our pillows wouldn't recommend to anyone"
30,Very average hotel for non Vegas. For Vegas super below average. Rooms size of a courtyard Marriott - small bathroom one sink  toilet in same room shower only - think your downstairs home bathroom. Rooms small and spartan - def way way lower than MGM and MGM is lower than the nice hotels like bellagio Venetian  Wynn etc.    Entire bank of elevators broke last night for about 3 hours - u had to get in a long line and use the service elevators. So all 6 elevators broke? Never seen this at any hotel ever in world.    Casino nice - no smoking! Restaurants very average. Overal this is a very minimal hotel - ok for cheap rate if u can get it or on points but prepare to be super underwhelmed. Someone said the rooms here r way better than across street more fun NYNY. Hard to believe that unless NYNY rooms r just awful.
30,Great location and a non-smoking property. Loved the Eataly restaurant area. Able to walk anywhere from this property. Unfortunately rooms are old and tired. No fridge or coffee maker was disappointing
50,Location was excellent. The hotel casino and room all extremely clean. We had the best sleep here with no noise and the blackout curtains. Loved that it a non-smoking environment throughout coming from NY we didn’t realize that smoking still allowed indoors in NV
30,Restaurants nice casino busy rooms need updating staff average. Tram did not work and there was no sign stating this. Reservations needed at most restaurants but you can get on a wait list. Close to airport.
30,For the Price the room could have included a Keurig and pods. Without it getting coffee in the am was a 20-30 minute trip to hit the lobby Starbucks and pay their $$$$$$ for a cup of joe and return. Not to mention trying to work the Card reader and Elevator button while holding two cups of coffee.
50,Best experience to visit Las Vegas and have a smoke free environment - alll restaurants and the entire casino - unheard of anywhere in Las Vegas. From a health standpoint - this is huge. Will never stay anywhere else!!
40,We had a very enjoyable stay at the Park MGM the room was bright and modern and all the facilities and services were very convenient. I had not stayed here since the renovations and rebranding as was pleasantly surprised. The location is good particularly if attending an event and the atmosphere is very upbeat.
10,Room is small old clogged sink broken phone shades were alot of work. Room needs a refridgerator . The hotel would not upgrade me and thats the first because every hotel upgrades a high roller... standard room sucks.
50,Park MGM is one of the best hotel in Vegas. While prices are lower than many the smoke free environment makes gambling and eating the best place to stay. The food is top rate particularly Primrose and La La Noodle. The work out facility is large and supports all types of exercise - they even have a separate room for yoga.
50,Very satisfied with staff and facilities. Eataly is a unique experience - great selection of delicious italian foods. Primsose restaurant is great for breakfast and lunch with a good selection for either meal.
50,The Park Mgm is in an excellent location on the strip. The casino is one of the few I dont get lost in. You can get from one end to the other in a straight line. Bavettes Nomad bar Best Friend Primrose and Eataly were all great places to eat. Definitely worth it.
40,Have a very cool check in without standing in line Love the phone door key also can make real card from phone. Bed in room very comfy love the nonsmoking hotel awesome . Very good breakfast  Easy check out on ohone  great experience
50,Staff is friendly. Property is non smoking super clean and fun. Pets are allowed and they have a nice pet area within yards of the property. Several wonderful restaurants to choose from. Bar service was superb.
10,Our room was awfully setup. The TV was to the side of the bed and not straight in front.    There is not much to do shop or eat in the hotel. Not many card tables open throughout the day or night. We spent more time at other hotels.
50,Absolutely loved the Park MGM. The entire property had a great vibe. I was especially happy that the entire property is smoke free. I will definitely be staying here next time i'm in Las Vegas. Highly recommended.
50,Hotel is absolutely beautiful of you have an event at the T-mobile arena like we did it is perfect. You just walk across the street and also located close to the m&m store coke a cola and Hershey store.
30,Aerosmith cancelled their show on Friday and the band and MGM knew that the Monday show was not going to be held. They held back info to keep the rooms full really soured me on the whole Vegas experience.
30,Rooms were a bit over priced. The machines are beyond tight. Never saw one person even hit one hand pay. The table games looked like a blast. The staff was very friendly. Eataly is the best part of the entire stay. All you need to eat on Italian.
30,Room was smaller than expected. When checking in at check in time was told room wasn’t ready. After being persistent that I needed my room because we had a concert to go to they found one. If I was not persistent I would not have gotten my room. If you are going to concert at T-MOBILE easy to get to.
30,Hall ways were very dirty and overall the room lacked coffee machine mini fridge etc. To get coffee in the morning the starbucks line was over an hour long every day. We had no interaction with staff because we did the self check in from our phones got our keys that way etc. Room was located very close to the T Mobile arena and we were there to see George Strait. I wouldn't stay at this hotel again.
50,Everything from the time we arrived until checkout was perfect. Staff was very friendly and accommodating. Rooms casino and restaurants are very clean and comfortable. Employees will do whatever necessary to make your visit a great experience.
30,Lobby was nice but the beds just sank when you sat on them. Carpet was very dirty and stained. Just didn’t seem worth the price. Really wish the room had a refrigerator and coffee maker. Lala noodle was amazing tho highly recommend.
20,"Went to see Aerosmith. Fantastic show. Dolby area is awesome. Unfortunately the Park MGM Hotel not so awesome. Limited dining options and most close at 10:00 PM. Food and drinks very expensive. A burger at the Grill is $18.00. You can go across the street to the Hard Rock Cafe and get a better burger and fries for $12.00. Two drinks plus two shots were $71.00. Bottled water in the room was $18.00. Those prices are crazy. Especially when they charge you $50 a day for a ""Resort Fee."" Only stayed there because of the concert. Way better places to stay on the strip with more attractions better food and better prices."
40,Park MGM was a wonderful fun trip for busines and fun. Non-smoking rooms were clean and fresh everything worked shower pressure was AMAZING (like a firehose) and the elevators were always uick and available even when swamped busy with NFR cowboys all over the place. The meeting rooms were well stocked clean and bright. The casino floor was wide open with lots of room in between machines and tables. However the tables were few and only certain games were available at certain times. We had to walk over to the Aria or New York New York to be able to play at 10:00 am - 2:00 pm wihtout having to wait for a Pai Gow or Three card poker table. I think there are only 4 tables open before noon not including blackjack. Disappointing. The stars of the show were the dealers and the pit bosses. They were not only engaging but genuinely loved working there (I asked them).Flora one of the pit boss was SO FUN to be around and alough constantly busy with the floor always remembered our names and happy to see us. Jane another dealer joked with us remembered us helped us with game questions and must have had us stay there another 4 hours becuase of her demeanor. Hopefully they will add more tables in the future when we visit again. Thank you and Salamat to the casino dealers and pit crew
50,A Beautiful Property. We love a non -smoking Casino. Very clean our suite was absolutely beautiful. In Room dining very prompt and delicious! My husband and I stay at Park MGM every November for our Anniversary .
50,Rooms are nice and beds are so comfy! The whole hotel and casino are 100% smoke free! That alone makes this a feat spot. The fitness center is top notch and opened 24 hours. Good options for food here but it’s vegas you can find what you’re craving anywhere. Close to the T Mobile area and they also have Starbucks in lobby area and they cost more but you can use your stats there
30,Rooms are very small. Strip view is seeing 2 neon signs across from convention center roof top. TV and guest portal on TV extremely slow and frustrating. Lack of many guest services on TV - poorest system I've ever seen! Will probably stay Bellagio Mirage or Venetian next time - much better!    Not MGM fault but Aeorsmith concert cancelled last min. It would have been nice if the hotel helped a bit on consideration. Trip was primarily to see them and hotel choice was based on this concert.
40,If I could get comp rooms with no resort fees (I'm MGM Gold status) I'd stay here every trip. I love the convenience and location of the Park MGM    Okay......it has to be a minimum of 200 characters huh? Well an ABC Store is right across the street LaLa Noodle's Beef Brisket Noodle Soup is one of my favorite things to eat in Las Vegas. You can get a kick ass clam chowder bread bowl next door at NYNY for $7. And T-Mobile Arena is about 200 yards away.
30,Hotel room does not have a fridge. Room did not feel clean - hairs in the bathroom dust on the shelving of the bathroom sediment in the drawers. Some rooms (like the one I stayed at) is directly across from the Arena. Black out curtains were useful.
10,Rooms not updated looks like the 1989. Plumbing in bathrooms drains backed up. No refrigeration. Storage for clothes look like college dorm rooms. Cocktails waitress in Casino rude. I requested cranberry/vodka she handed me one already on her tray watered down and just walked away.
50,Had a great time and it was mostly made possible by the friendly staff and great service! This is my go to spot to have a great time in Las Vegas. Make sure you sign up for the rewards they make the experience even better. They also take great care of us older Veterans.
20,Every restaurant in this place was high and the food was not very good. The beds and pillows were great. That is the only good thing. The halls are dark and dim. The slots were really tight. We booked tickets for a concert that was canceled. They did nothing to compensate us and the concert was the only reason we came here
50,Good accommodations and a good location to all areas we like to frequent. Did make the trip to vegas to take a friend to see Aerosmith for his birthday and they ended up cancelling the show. Am aware MGM has no control over that but still annoying and expensive trip for not.
40,Great place for a weekend trip. We enjoyed the non-smoking in the casino as well as the proximity to other locations on the strip. Nomad library was a great spot for dinner as are Bavette's and La La Noodle.
50,I very much enjoyed my stay at the Park MGM. The staff were always nice and accommodating. The smoke free environment really helped improve my enjoyment. The room was clean and water pressure in the shower great.
50,I thought it was excellent value for the price. The room was simple but suited most of my purposes and there were amenities in the bathroom that aren't always provided average level hotels so that was a pleasant surprise. I have gold loyalty status and was placed on the highest floor. Not sure if the room was an upgrade but regardless I found it spacious for my eight night stay.    I thought the lack of a fridge was really poor decision making. I was prepared to pay money to have a microwave in my room but there weren't any available even at a cost. From a sustainability standpoint it was disappointing given the huge sizes of the meals at the in-house restaurants - it felt awful to waste so much both from a money standpoint and food wastage standpoint. Please consider being more responsible in this respect - decreasing portion sizes would be an alternative way to approach it if you couldn't possibly invest in fridges as a standard inclusion and microwaves to borrow/hire or place one on each floor for communal use.    Primrose - difficult to get a table right away even if arriving at different times in the morning. I ended up dining at the bar every morning just to get a seat. The service was accurate friendly and prompt. I ordered assortments of sides for breakfast here and the portion sizes of those were fine.    Casino - it could be difficult to get a space at roulette and some of the staff were cranky including the drinks ladies. That dampened my enjoyment.    Best Friend - I didn't make a reservation and thought I would try my luck on a Friday night. I was able to get a seat at the bar immediately and tried the chef's tasting menu. It was great but an obscene waste of food - see fridge/microwave situation above.    NoMad Bar - I went for brunch and was not able to book online the indication was that there were no tables available so I thought I would try through a concierge and it was no problem to get a booking. When I was there it was over half empty so you may want to consider checking your online reservation system in case that's turning people off. I didn't love the musician's choice of songs but dropped a tip in his bowl anyway - he didn't acknowledge me - made me sorry I bothered. My bananas foster pancakes were delicious and service was good.    Side Car Betty - attentive service and great value for money especially for Vegas. I really enjoyed the barbacoa pork nachos.    Lala Noodle - tasty quick and good service.    Bavette - also tasty quick and good service. I did think it was a bit expensive for what it was and definitely disappointed to have to waste so much food which was more of a pain given how expensive it was.    Spa: made my appointments through the concierge and got massage facial mani pedi and haircut with blowout. I found it all to be very good and liked that there were good snack and drink options in the relaxation lounge.    Usually I like to try different hotels in Vegas for the novelty factor but I know this is one I'll go back to.
40,"Went to see Aerosmith concert and wanted to be close to venue so decided to stay at hotel. Eataly was great as well. Decor of hotel wasn't in true ""Vegas fashion"" but it was fine. Room was spacious enough for two people and bathroom was good size. Beds were super comfy. Dolby Live Theater was amazing....not a bad seat in the house! Primrose Restaurant was delicious....Jillian was an excellent server. If you want to see bling for the holidays walk over to the Bellagio."
40,We stayed the weekend here and had a great time It is perfectly located next to T-Mobile where we saw George Strait. Food was good and this resort is smaller than some of the biggest Casinos which it nice
50,Love the location being close to everything. Bed was very comfortable. Best thing was it being completely smoke-free. It was so nice being able to walk through the casino without the stronghold cigarette smell that takes your breath away.
30,The rooms are small and our window was shattered. The floors needed new carpet. Actually the whole hotel needs updated. Especially for what you pay for a night. The concert was cancelled and the hotel didn’t seem to care.
40,Went to Las Vegas for a family birthday celebration. Loved the property location the Eatily was amazing. Had some trouble with our room but staff was responsive and our needs were met. Would stay again for sure!
40,the room is ok. i thought it would be a lot nicer since the hotel got a refresh. but part of the room is still old. i would suggest you guys adding frig to all your room since most of the other hotel offers that
40,Close to everything you'd need in Vegas easy access to the freeway and airport. Eataly is great for food and I love that it is a NON-SMOKING hotel/casino. Slots are fun and the only place I ever win.
10,"I didn't have high expectations for the hotel given that it is the old Monte Carlo and the last time I stayed there the carpets were rippling and caused me to trip and fall in the hallway. But I did have some expectations that the renovations were done well and not simply ""slapping lipstick on a pig"" but alas the renovations were subpar. Not to mention my room looked like it was straight out of a 1970s porn who thought an 8' long red velvet couch was a good idea in a casino. I can only imagine how dirty that thing is!    The ways in which the renovation were subpar include red paint overspray on the bathroom ceiling (I hope it was paint otherwise it was blood) paint bubbles on the dresser and nightstand inadequate ventilation in the bathroom inadequate air handler in the main room lack of refrigerated mini bar and a wooden table that looks like it was a reused afterthought from a 1990s hotel room which did not fit the ""1970s porn"" vibe of room."
40,Thanksgiving gathering.  That was very special event made so by the Park MGM..  With a group of 16 we were able to do many things together and independently..  This is my 3rd stay at same location. I am intending on future stays at the Park.. i Love this place..
40,Good location very good cleanliness good amenities. Gambling ok.  Friendly staff. Solid meeting room facilities. Not a lot of pomp and circumstance. Good sports bar with betting opportunities. Nice taxi service to airport.
30,The wait to get things fixed in the room was insane. This may have been due to staffing issues but Our room had issues with sink and shower draining and Tv not connecting it took over 5 hours to get someone to fix the tv issues and the sink and shower never were taken care of. Normally we are pleased this visit not so impressed with a few adjustments Park Mgm would be back to great again.
50,We truly enjoyed our stay at Park MGM. The location was perfect and the entire resort including the casino floor was non-smoking! The restaurants affiliated with the resort were of great quality and we particularly enjoyed Primrose and Eataly!
40,We had a awesome time at Park MGM We eat at a lot of the restaurants and we didn’t experience any problems at all Primrose the best breakfast in town And La PIZZA & LA PASTA for dinner was absolutely delicious. Best of all NO SMOKING
10,They charge the high Vegas prices but didn’t deliver! The Winn is so much nicer and cheaper with so many other offerings. Resort world is a million times nicer! The hotel was so dirty and in need of vacuuming. The maid never cleaned our room during our stay.
20,"Disappointed with room. Bed was old. TV is on side wall not facing head of the bed. Stupid. Furniture was mediocre. Lighting was poor. Digital key using phone did not work easily. I had to go up and down in elevator multiple times before key worked. Should have gotten a room key card but the line was so long every time I checked I stuck with my phone. Non-smoking aspect is best part of whole place. Restaurants are not great. Eataly needs a translator to read menu and it is VERY slow. Couldn't get a ""regular"" breakfast anywhere. I was there on an offer so I should be more appreciative but I never pay for rooms in Las Vegas..I gamble enough to warrant free rooms (nothing is free! 🤣) I justify my gambling $$ by not paying for rooms and food. I will stay somewhere else next time unless they give me another great offer and a different/better style room!"
50,Enjoyed this beautiful non smoking hotel and casino!!! Good food!!! Great gaming!!! Clean and large rooms…I very much enjoyed the food at the Eataly and shopped for Christmas gifts for friends. I also like that it’s central on the strip
50,A smaller casino area than others but being a non-smoker and sitting in a smoke free environment was worth the walk from where I was staying. Now that I know I may stay here next time. Park is also a short walk to a free tram ride that takes you to Bellagio.  Lots of walking required no matter where you go in Vegas. I averaged 6 miles a day.
50,Everything was amazing. We will definitely be back. The beds could be a little bit taller. But they were extremely comfortable so it was ok. Rooms were clean and spacious and perfect lighting. Will recommend to ev.
50,The hotel was a pleasant surprise clean nice rooms friendly staff great location. The fact that the hotel is non smoking is such a plus. The Primrose has incredible food and drinks. Our waiter Carlos was absolutely phenomenal.
50,"We were very pleased with our stay at Park MGM. All the services were made easy to use (""user friendly"") from booking check-in travel and parking our stay thru to check-out! Excellent location to venue also (Dolby Live)."
30,Room walls are paper thin. Could hear simple conversation from the next room. Housekeeping missed our room. Had to call them late at night so that we could have our room cleaned. Had trouble with my cell phone “key”.
50,Service good  clean hotel  I would like to go back and stay at Park MGM again. Convenient for me to go eat at downstairs and close to Aria’s hotel  New York hotel.Service excellent Customers service excellent
50,Everything was excellent from a seamless check in/checkout to the cleanliness of of the room to the wonderful pool/bartenders and servers. Most importantly to me and my wife SMOKE FREE!!! We will be back!
50,I started playing the myVegas app on my phone in late June and got enough points to get 2 nights at Park MGM with only the resort fee+taxes by August. Booked the rooms for Nov 29/30. So easy to get to Park MGM from the airport; Awesome Bell desk and easy mobile check in. I even made my own physical key just to have one for the elevator. The Best Friend restaurant is amazing and you can make reservations online and the Side Betty Grill is ready for you late into the night. We won on the slot machines and my brother is great at Texas Hold 'em so he played at the Aria which is connected right to the Park MGM. We took the tram to Bellagio and loved every minute of the trip. We even went to the Ka show also at great price from myVegas rewards. The trip paid for itself. How is this place real?
40,Went to the Aerosmith Dueces are Wild concert at the Dolby Live venue at the hotel/casino. Once I found it the sound system made for an excellent concert experience - but finding it wasn’t a straightforward task as the signage was seriously lacking.
40,What a treat to walk around a casino and not smell cigarettes!! Very friendly staff and clean room was also appreciated however it could have been more sound proof. I wish I could have used the spa facilities. I would stay again.
50,Great hotel great food options fantastic location. The food area called Eataly is incredible. A super selection of several Italian food & drink options. All very high quality. Very close to lots of other hotels and attractions. Plus a walk bridge right out the door to navigate to the other side of The Strip. That's a great option.
50,thank you accommodating our dogs to your hotel! They had just as much fun as we did!! We like the fact we can go from one casino to the next and not have to stay in the cold for very long.It was a quick trip and we enjoyed it.
20,The staff at MGM Park are clueless and of not help. They don't even know there own property of what is open to eat and what is not!! Just asking a sample question they had no answers. As far as the casino floor there where never any cocktail servers on the floor for drinks. You had to go find one yourself. The customer service at this property is a decrease. This property is nothing like the other properties that I have stayed at.
40,The staff is very attentive and helpful. Great selection of restaurants. Bavettes is one of my favorite steak houses on the strip. Lala Noodle provides tasty Thai cuisine at an off strip price. Mama Rabbits is my go to bar; be sure to say hello to Jonathan (my favorite bartender) Close to everything. Slots seem to be very loose. Service is always phenomenal.
50,Very lovely hotel in a great location on the Strip. Conference rooms were spacious. Food was very good. Friendly staff and atmosphere. Loved the Eataly section for dining desserts coffee and shopping.
50,This is the renovated Monte Carlo. They did a great job. I love the location the size the ambience. This was the first time so I'm curious to explore more that the hotel has to offer. I will be returning hopefully to try the suites or penthouse.
50,I liked the location so close with the place I want to go. Good customer service staff are friendly and accommodating. Food from the Eataly was really great. I love the panini’s pizza and of course the choices of desserts!!
30,Nice and very clean except I did find in closet of my room  Staff did give me a refund on my stay  I wish the mold wasint there to begin with  Staff did offer to switch rooms but I didint want to deal with having to pack everything back up and unpacking all over again
50,We were able to drive straight in parking lot park car go in hotel and check in room without having to go to desk or anything else. The concert was in the same building so no more driving required! Everything we needed was right there!
50,I was redeeming a birthday gift from my family after telling them how much I disliked the MGM Grand following my last stay. They said try the Park it’s better. They were right. I enjoyed almost everything about the hotel. The only drawback was after hours dinning/snacking.
50,Great location we went to a Golden Knights game and Aerosmith concert. Just had hip surgery so walking isn’t fun so having everything close by was perfect. Had a lot of fun waiting for the game with all the outside entertainment.
30,I was checked into a room that was occupied already. Had to go get different room all while trying to be on time to concert. It was super frustrating and yhe new rpom was way up and way down the hall where i had asked for my original room near the elevator
30,Asked for connected rooms as I was traveling with children from initial booking. I was told check in personally instead of MGM app so I could get better assistance yet they weren't able to accommodate my request. Would have not booked Park MGM.
50,It was my first trip to Vegas and the time at park MGM was amazing top notch amazing food and restaurants and close by amenities it should be on your bucket list as one of your destinations to visit
40,Nice hotel staff were attentive and friendly. The rooms could be more updated as the colours scheme looks very gloomy. Shower head was excellent really strong pressure.  The key usage for the elevator was slow to identify and you have to hold the key to the sensor for a few seconds which slows the process for everyone using the elevator at the same time.
50,The Best place to stay in Las Vegas!!    💯 Smoke Free    Excellent places to dine!  Easy access and easiest checking/check out!  Coffee and any amenities within a few steps either Starbucks or specialty shops!
50,My family and I took a trip to Vegas for Thanksgiving because we wanted to try something different for a change. We loved the comforting feeling you get right when you walk through the doors. We all enjoyed our stay and would most definitely come back.
50,Loved the check in experience using the MGM App. Walked right past the big line and straight to my room and used my phone as the room key. Room was very nice. Everything was clean and new. Had strip view but you mostly just see the roof of the hotel as it is set far back for the strip itself. Great restaurants. Loved Eataly and Best Friend. Will try Bavette's the next time as other guests said it was great. Great spot on the strip near everything.
50,Our immediate and extended family met in Vegas for a 21st birthday. We got a total of 8 rooms 1 of which was a suite so we could all have space to hang out at the hotel before going out. The rooms were clean and the shades are dark so sleeping in was easy! Housekeeping did a great job keeping our rooms clean. Key cards only work for the floor you’re staying on which can make meeting up with people on other floors more challenging-so if you go with other people just request to be on the same floor. The hotel is clean nice selection of restaurants friendly staff and good location to zip around to other hotels. Overall loved our stay here and would definitely stay here again.
50,Easy Check-in/Check-out great location tons of food options (loved Eataly) lots of entertainment options with Dolby Live and T-Mobile Arena right there. Room was clean and we had a nice view from the 18th floor. If you want a mini fridge there is a nightly fee which is ridiculous. Over all we would stay here again.
50,The hotel was clean staff was friendly and the selection of eateries was awesome. We would definitely stay here again. Love the fact that there is a back way to the hotel and can completely avoid the strip to get to and from the hotel parking.
30,"We have stayed many times at the Park / Monte Carlo and like it because it is centrally located on the Strip. Its nice that the complex is now smoke free - the old smells are gone and you can enjoy sitting anywhere without a smoker sitting beside you thinking its their right to be able to blow smoke in your face. We find the choices for eating here are not great - expensive and too trendy so we usually eat elsewhere - other than LaLa Noodle we gave a pass on everything else.  Rooms are basic but you are hardly ever in them and the redo a few years back was refreshing. Still our ""go to"" property in Vegas."
50,We did not have to wait too long at the bell desk. There was enough staff to attend to us. The food and menu selections at Lulunoodle are delicious. A little pricey but worth every penny. The Eataly is my favorite spot to hangout for lunch and/or dinner. The pizza selections brings back memories of my Italian trip. Overall the experience was great.
20,Some other's personal stuff and luggage are still on the bed when we go into the room. Restroom & room are obviously not ready yet. We called from the room to front desk to request another room. When we go out ran into the last guest they were trying to get into the same room......kind of awkward. It was around 3:30pm when we check in.
50,The one major down side of Vegas used to be the smoke. Park MGM has finally addressed this problem. From the staff to the property food options and location on the strip / in the heart of the activity this is simply my new favorite place to stay.
50,MGM park is a nice hotels for families. They don’t smoking which is a plus since we have small children. The Italian food court serves really good food. The location is great. Only issues if there is a game  traffic is a little tough.
50,No smoking smell decent crowd. Perfect location. Many food options available. Beautiful property. Staff is very friendly. Nice & Clean rooms. Got room on 22nd floor awesome view. Eataly is nice place to try authentic Italian food.
50,Excellent location. Smoke free. Variety of slots and table games. Great service at sports bar. Nice choice of dining spots. Especially enjoyed La La Noodles. Proximity to T Mobile Arena is a major plus.
10,Bathroom had pubic hair all over on the floor shower and sink. You can hear even normal volume conversations from people in adjoining rooms. Don’t assume you’ll get your room is ready text…you likely have to go to the desk multiple times. Would avoid the hotel. The casino is nice. Really enjoyed Primrose for brunch.
50,The Park is the only play I say at in Vegas. Great environment Great food Great staff Great pool Great rooms and more. This is a strip hotel that is free of chaos. Its super relaxing and a great choice if youre looking for that sort of thing in a Vegas trip.
10,As someone else recently mentioned--the rooms do not look as advertised at this allegedly 4-star hotel.    They're awful.    I’m here on business travel. I arrived late last night but there was no one around to help me with my luggage. The front desk reception representative didn’t suggest how I could even get a cart to load my luggage. But I was tired and decided to handle it so I could get to bed. Once I arrived to the floor. I struggled to push my luggage on the 70s-era carpet in the very dark hallway. And I mean VERY dark. That’s an issue for me as a woman traveling solo. It doesn’t at all feel safe.    The room is similarly dark and dated with lighting fixtures and ugly carpet from the 1980s and an ugly green couch from the 1970s. No desk but an old scratched wood table and chair in front of the TV. I woke up the next day to find that this room doesn’t even include a coffeemaker–even Hampton Inns have coffeemakers and more modern in-room amenities. I’m working on East Coast time and really needed the coffee and breakfast so I decided to bite the bullet and pay for the overpriced in-room dining. I hung up after holding for 10 minutes.    And I was so tired until I didn’t realize that the sink was dirty!    I want out of here. I’m angry that my organization is paying this outrageous rate plus a resort fee for this dump. I’m trying to work and attend a conference at the same time and I don’t have time to deal with this. But I tell you this for sure: I will never EVER consider this place when I return to Vegas on my own time. Or for business. Absolutely unacceptable.
20,This was my first trip to Las Vegas and I was anticipating a wonderful hotel experience. We chose the Park MGM because of the proximity to the T-Mobile Center. Wow! Not impressed. The hotel is very dated with low ceilings and dark corridors. Our hall was so dark we had to use our cell phone to see the room number. We had upgraded to what we thought was going to be a nice room but it lacked amenities and was dirty. There wasn't a fridge or a coffee maker. The windows had finger prints and smudges on them. It looked as if a dog had pressed its nose to the window of a car. The decor consisted of an uncomfortable low bed one chair a long window couch (that was very hard) and a beat up old wooden table for eating writing etc. The towels were scratchy and thin. The entire floor smelled--possibly sewer. The only positive thing we found was the Primrose restaurant and the close proximity to the Eataly. I will say the employees we encountered were very pleasant and helpful.
10,The rooms DO NOT look as advertised. They're horrible. Not worth the $$. The pictures online show gorgeous looking rooms instead you walk into something that is dingy dirty & depressing. The bathroom was not clean there were stains on the bedding. Every wall was painted blood red - seriously Freddy Krueger would've been happy to have the room I was in. And my room was just above a club so there was no sleeping until after 4am - this was after getting back to the room a little after 2am.
40,Overall it was a great stay and concert but for the quality of the room we’ve stayed at cheaper places with better rooms and in room accommodations our room was musty no coffee pot no micro wave and no mini fridge
50,Check in and out was fast and I did it through the app. My room was clean and nice. The casino was fun had every slot and table game you could want. Juniper bar was very nice and the drinks were well mixed. I had a great stay and will definitely be back.
30,First time in Las Vegas went to see Aerosmith so decided to stay in the same hotel as the concert. A little trouble getting to the room but was fixed by the front desk. Got to the room and was dusty and they left the cleaning rag in the middle of the headboard. Not sure if they half cleaned it or where about to clean it. Lots of gambling to be done at the ground floor but was more interested in the concert. Besides getting bland pasta for dinner and over priced the rest was a good experience.
40,Great location to everything. Park MGM is convenient to bus routes is safe great stay.  Unfortunately Vegas has become 'KID CITY' and no longer sin city so the number of whining kids makes Vegas no longer appealing regardless of hotel experience.
10,Not the best at Nomad. Knowing ahead of time that this area is older would have been helpful. I am aware this is Vegas everything is expensive but the room service is outrageously priced for what we received.
40,We booked last minute and were attracted to the boutique hotel feel of this property. Good location rooms are ok for the price very good in fact. Felt it could be a little bit cleaner. This is not a luxury experience but decor is well done. Perfect if you want a more chill time. Bonus is casino is non smoking. We had a terrible experience at the Nomad Library it is beautiful but the food was awful by far the worst steak of my life I am still unsure it was beef but wine list is incredible however I wouldn’t recommend for anything more than a drink.
40,Park MGM is a pleasant hotel to stay at we were on the 5th floor and I was surprised with how quiet the room was. We could not hear people walking overhead or in the hall. Love the fact that the hotel lobby is smokefree it smells so much better than other buildings on the inside. Only downside is we did not have a fridge in our room. Rooms feel a bit dated but overall it was a nice place to stay. If you are wanting something a little more special I would choose the MGM Towers instead.
50,Smoke free 100% a draw for me. Love the atmosphere and the staff. Great time. Gambling could have been better but that is why they call it gambling. It was fun and relaxing either way. Food at Tuscana was amazing.
50,Great experience at Park MGM from the time we arrived until the morning we left. Professional friendly staff second to none. The front desk were great when we arrived the staff at the restaurants we ate in were spectacular. We loved the fact that Park MGM is a non- smoking facility as well.
20,Charged $40 dollars for early checkin when room wasn’t fully ready. Dirty utensils and straw at top of headboard. The snack/drinks wasn’t filled nor reset upon arrival. After being in our room an hour the maid presumably let herself into our room stating she needed to refill snack/drink items. Hard to communicate due to broken English.
40,Location is good and it’s a non smoking facility but it was not worth the high price. Will not stay there again. No refrigerator in room- you have to pay extra if you want one. Parking is not free like many other hotels in the area. It is $18/night. Very chaotic during hockey games as T-Mobile is next door.
50,We received a great price at this property during the Thanksgiving week. The best part was that the whole place was non-smoking casino included. Thank you MGM for providing a clean place of entertainment.
20,I got a verbal confirmation when checking in the front desk for late checkout. I booked through Chase’s hotel and luxury collection for some extra stay credit. My late checkout was not input in the system and at the last day I was hounded by staff via phone accusing that I was in the wrong and was supposed to check out at 11. There was no accountability for this mistake and no one acknowledged any wrong doing. I am disappointed and I will never stay here again.
50,Very nice staff at front desk. Listened to my issue I had and gave me a room that accomidated my needs. I do have a disablitity and the lady took that into account when she asigned my room to me. Thank you for the care!
30,The beds are low and are not true Queen size i.e. two plus people will not sleep comfortably. The couches are hard and uncomfortable (no pull-out option). The bathroom toilet sits low and the dry towels are small and of cheap quality. You are not given complimentary water. The room has no microwave or mini refrigerator. The hotel charges $14 per item if you eat any food in the room - they don't tell you the costs. Parking in the garage is $18 a night - option to charge to your room. I will be honest and state you will be in a good location - various restaurants and Starbucks in the hotel. The hotel is close to the Tram. You can rent a scooter for $45 a day. The hotel is direct across the street from Denny's Target Marshalls M&M store and next to a mall with high-end stores (i.e. Gucci Fendi etc.). You are 12 minutes from the airport. Not the best hotel for a family.
50,Great stay with initial move in cleanses issues. There were hair on beds sheets and floors. Asked to be moved to another room but was denied. Maid service was scheduled and performed. Later my room was changed on request to be closer to elevators due to my foot pain.
20,Hello  When we arrive to our hotel at 4:30pm our room was still not ready. I completed our online check in earlier that morning. The hotel front desk told me our room would be ready at 3pm. Once we were able to get in our room we found our room with zero towels furniture out of place and the windows were disgusting.    Dont stay here...not one apology either
50,This hotel is it dude. You gotta stay here relax and gamble a little. The staff hook it up and will make anything happen for you. ANYTHING. Las Vegas has always been a great location destination and the MGM Park takes it to the next level.
10,Water 9 dollars  Lunch / dinner 120$  Deposit hotel 200$ plus 88$ plus 44$ for a simple room  People vaping weed . People drinking and yelling no good sleep . Primerose tap nasty water service animals no welcome they . yell at you if your service dog is thirsty. Go drunk because if you are sober it’s impossible to deal with the rip off . The lady Gaga store is nice. Little bottle of shampoo.
50,This was our first time to visit Las Vegas. We were thrilled to find that Park MGM is a smoke-free facility so we were able to enjoy the casino without the strong odor of cigarette smoke. The location was excellent. Almost everything was within walking distance but if you do not enjoy walking there is a free tram to the Bellagio. Rooms were a nice size and very clean. We would definitely stay here again.
50,We always stay at Park MGM. Best showers and comfortable beds. We love that it is non smoking Hotel. We always have a great one at BETMGM Bar. We really enjoy that the strip is literally outside the hotel everything is at walking distance.
50,Fun exciting every single moments staying las vegas park mgm was a gift and Thanksgiving award to our family I hope to travel again with this spectacular experience in the near future.. what a terrific experience it is
40,We always enjoy Park MGM particularly that it is smoke free. Having Eataly on premises is a delightful addition. The location is convenient  we can walk or tram from there without having to get our car. Staff is friendly and professional.
30,Good value great staff convenient location (mid-strip) tired rooms. Food at the Primrose cafe is good. Service throughout the property is excellent - attentive & caring.  The room we had 28th floor felt tired and was oddly furnished. Only one chair for the table. The room is a nice size but the furnishings make it feel like it's a room in renovation and they forgot.a few items.
30,Nothing fancy about this hotel. It is a good central location. The room was very stuffy turned the ac to 60 to maybe get it to 75. Had multiple rooms reserved for a family reunion celebrating a 40th wedding anniversary and a 30th birthday. The hotel did nothing...not even a bottle of wine. Parking was 26.00 a day. Hmmm Vegas is an expensive vacation.
50,One of my best memories of Las Vegas is the light fragrant floral smells when entering the hotel. Lately that has been lost to the aroma of (legal) weed in the entrance parking areas and even some rooms. MGM has a fresh air policy keeping a smoke free casino is not easy but they get it right.
40,We got four free rooms comped through MGM promos and then had to pay for three nights. I disliked having to pay a resort fee since the only thing we did was sleep a few hours and then shower/change for the day. Seems like the cost for Wi-Fi should be included in the standard room rates. We were under the impression that the resort fee gave us access to the spa/sauna but then found out it was an additional $50/person for basic spa access so am upset about that.  Room service was good enjoyed having beds made and towels refreshed. The pillows were very thick and would have wanted thinner ones but couldn’t get ahold of anyone to request them.  Had a problem with the AC couldn’t keep the room cool enough and had the thermostat at 62*. There was also a persistent sewer smell coming from one of the drains in the bathroom.  I attempted once to call the front desk and also a few times to speak to them in person at the front desk but the wait was too long so just went with it. Mostly irritated that we had to pay for three nights in this room and still had these issues and there wasn’t a timely way to resolve them.  Otherwise the casino was very nice. Their food court can be very crowded and the food tends to be expensive but it looks amazing. We never actually ate there.  Taxi process leaving was slightly odd; didn’t have the usual stream of them waiting for customers so we waited about 15 minutes. The nice part is the taxis and ride shares are at the same location and easy to access.
50,We live in Southern California so we travel to Vegas frequently. We prefer MGM properties and the The Park MGM has become our favorite for the clean smoke-free environment. We also love the location on the strip. Far less crazy than other properties We love to watch the crazy so we travel down the strip for that entertainment!
10,No in-room amenities- no coffee machine no fridge no microwave oven. Dark corridors. Rooms very old. Carpet very old. Partitions between rooms are thin; you can hear your neighbors. I will never stay again.
40,Really enjoyed my stay overall just had some sewage smell issues in the hotel hallways that would come and go and they don’t comp much or give many reward perks for gambling there. Had way more comps at other casino hotels in the past but definitely not a bad place if you are in town for any event at T Mobile since you’re so close to the arena.
20,There was a sulfer smell on our floor. The rooms were very basic and not what you expect from MGM and similar Vegas properties. For example the table in the room was scratched up and the carpet had stains.
50,Check in was super easy front desk staff were very friendly and happy to change our room to a better location.  Prim Rose restaurant offers a variety of food breakfast is delicious staff was attentive.  Eataly is a cool Italian themed section of the hotel that is cool and full of choices to experience a taste of Italy.
40,Overall we liked it. The self check-in and check-out the location was fantastic ability to get around was great too. The food was really good even if Las Vegas prices. You cannot have a meal for 2 under $100. With that kind of pricing it feels like usary not to have a coffee machine in the room. If you want to take some quiet time during your trip coffee and toast from room service will cost you almost $40. There's so much to do and so many attractions is that kind of nonsense really necessary MGM?
50,Park MGM Las Vegas is a great place to stay in the middle of everything. I really like the location and everything that they have available here. I really like their pool area. The staff here is very helpful and provides excellent customer service.
30,"There is a reason Park MGM is affordable: The hotel is kinda ""meh"" in general. The room was not what we expected in that some of the walls were red like fire engine red the decor was funky/eclectic not in a good way. The carpet was pretty dirty and there was some food-like schmutz dried onto the table and the leather chair looked like it had been there and seen much from the original Monte Carlo days. Also the shower pressure was really high with no way to adjust it lower.  Parking was good though not free--but be aware that event attendees at T-Mobile Arena also use that garage.  On the plus side the beds were pretty comfortable which at least made it a functional choice overall.  On the PLUS plus side the casino is smoke-free which we both loved. The staff was friendly except for one surly BJ dealer who made a face when presented with some match play coupons but wasn't entirely unfriendly. The restaurant hours were a little hard to figure out because the QR codes steer you to the MGM website and there you hunt for the hours of operation. We only ate at La La Noodle (not bad) and Eataly (also not bad).  Our experience was a ""maybe yes-maybe no"" on whether we'll return."
20,I selected this hotel because of the online price and location. The rates vary depending on the day of the week. The rooms do not include a coffee maker or mini-fridge. There is no guest laundry facility on-site.
10,The hotel was dirty got to our room and it was filthy. Dirty sheets and pillowcases hair on the floor in the bathroom water (I hope water) spilled on the table and the floor thick smudges on the window. We requested a new room and it was equally dirty. Rooms are small and dark hallways are dark dirty and dated. The pictures online looked so beautiful I had such high hopes for Park MGM. So disappointed. We checked out and moved to another hotel.
50,Park MGM is walking distance to many restaurants and t mobile stadium. The only thing was that we were on the side that t mobile is on. When something is going on there you can hear all the noise from the parking lot.
50,Love location of the hotel. The room were nice pool area was good. Reason for choosing this hotel I was going to the Usher concert and it was nice to be at the same hotel the concert was. Will stay there again.
40,Stayed there for a business trip. Enjoyed the resort it had several options for dinner and breakfast. The Casino is fine and the staff was pleasant. No poker room. The rooms are nice with great room darkening shades for sleeping in. Front desk staff was excellent.
20,We got to the room and it was extremely underwhelming. It was so small. The bathroom wasn’t even as nice as a Fairfield inn. It was clean though. The amenities at the inn were just OK. The casino was smoke free which was nice.
40,Easy walk to other casinos and entertainment venues. Not a better place to stay if you’re going to T-Mobile Arena. Nice restaurants - Eataly onsite is wonderful. Great bars with very good live entertainment.
40,There was a staff waiting just as we entered and he checked us in on his iPad which was very convenient. The room was small it adequate. The casino was smallish too. Eataly is a bit of a novelty in terms of the food that you get. Food was nice desserts were amazing - but it’s not cheap - though cheap is a relative term.    Biggest issue with the property is the location. While there are worse locations it’s too far south. For me (and others may disagree) the best location is Cosmo Bellagio and Paris Linq etc
10,Couldn’t stand it. Amenities are not good and rooms are mediocre with no services. Waited 30 minutes every morning for coffee and no coffee makers. No fridges. Nobody at pool bar to order coffee or drinks. Half the pool was closed and charged the same for amenities
30,Overall experience was good but I had my pup with me and paying $100 per night without any dog amenities no bowls no beds no treats…. The pet relief area is tiny  super tiny . Hope the hotel will make some improvement.
50,non smoking friendly safe hotel and casino. Staff. very top notch. it's the old monto Carlo hotel casino spent millions reducing the park mgm. every dollar for once was well spent I believe. I loved the location. walked to other properties like new york NY casino and the mgm grand just excellent properties also. but something special about park mgm. have to experience it. I know been coming to Vegas since 92.
40,If you are looking for high end luxury Park MGM isn’t your place. If you are looking for a hotel that’s affordable with a great location and fun casino..Park MGM is for you!  Park MGM pros:  -Great location  -Affordable  -Smaller casino but has plenty of slot and table game options with lower table minimums  -Fun lounges with solid drink menus  -Connected by tram to Aria and bellagio.  CONS  -Smaller rooms  -Great technology (digital key) but the service and Wi-Fi are spotty at best. I have Verizon as my cellular provider and couldn’t use my digital key in the hallway to my room.  -Not many dining options. If you don’t want Italian your entire stay then Park MGM isn’t a good fit.
50,Excellent variety of slot machines providing some generous winners. A lot of eateries to choose from although they were somewhat overpriced. Many signs indicating directions to restrooms and hotel lobby etc.
50,Staff are amazing very friendly and extremely helpful we love the entire no smoking casino ;)  room was very clean and comfortable.  Located next to T-mobile which makes it extremely easy to get to and from the games and concerts.
50,Everything you need! Beds are very comfortable. Hotel is clean and staff is friendly and helpful. I was on the 14th floor..great view of the Strip. Rooms are easy to get to..not a very long walk if in the casino.
50,"I really like this property. In the MGM portfolio I call this a ""Mid Level property"". Better than Luxor / Excalibur but not at the level of Mandalay Bay and Bellagio. Love the location. Love the fact it is non-smoking. Easy access to T-Mobile Arena. I definitely recommend it."
50,The Park is a breath of fresh air... LITERALLY. The smoke free casino is AMAZING the staff has always been friendly and there's a decent amount of tables games avaliable and because of all of this I will not be staying anywhere else when I go to Vegas.
40,Love that the hotel and casino are nonsmoking. Eataly was excellent and had several meals there. The food options or varied enough but I never felt like I was choosing between the same options twice.  A couple small critiques about the rooms… The walls are very thin so you can hear every conversation (and late night activity…) in the room next to you and the bathroom needed some deferred maintenance completed.
50,Always enjoy MGM properties but this one superior due to the entire casino and hotel was smoke free…. It was wonderful. So nice to breath clean fresh air and the machines weren’t covered in ashes. Also great location as T-Mobile is right next door and staff was friendly. We’ll be back!!
50,Great hotel! Stayed with my grandpa and he didn't believe the casino was smoke free. He was completely surprised when he walked in an it smelled amazing in the casino and there was no cigarette or tobacco smell! Amazing place in general! Mgm has really gone above and beyond with this casino
40,Park MGM is in a great location and is a great value. The staff was excellent. The property overall deserves a very high rating for how pleasant and easy to use. I would downgrade it because our room was noisy. We heard water running in pipes people out in the halls and next door. It could have been considerably worse if our neighbors had been having a party. But considering that it was mostly just normal conversations and we heard them i would be a bit afraid of running having noisy neighbors thatEataly has excellent
50,I would like for everyone to know that Security Officer Bobby Tomas demonstrated his commitment to excellence and his superior customer service skills when we visited Park MGM. He was most helpful and went out of his way to ensure that we reached our destination. His positive attitude and knowledge are in keeping with the finest traditions of the hospitality industry. You are lucky to have him working for you and he should be considered for positions of responsibility to ensure all your employees conduct themselves in similar ways.
30,Easy access to the tram to other casinos. Staffs were friendly. Easy walk to park and eatery. Housekeeper should pay more attention in cleaning. My room was dirty when checked in. However someone came and cleaned after we made phone calls.
50,Stop looking you've found the place! Super clean and the value is outstanding. I will stay here from now on when we are in town.  The beds are awesome and the air is fantastic.  I had a great experience.
20,I had money stolen from my suitcase and I reported it to security. I wanted them to find out who went in my room between 830pm Saturday to 5am Sunday Nov 19th 2022 to Nov 20th 2022. I had 1400 in 100 dollar bill stolen from my suitcase and I am still waiting for them to check security cameras
50,This was our first time staying at Park MGM. Love the friendly service cleanliness helpful perfect spot and great food especially eatly. I highly recommend this hotel to everyone. Give it a try you'll love it.
50,Had a great time at Park MGM. Location was ideal staff were amazing food was excellent. Loved how close it was to T-Mobile Arena. Thought having the Tram to get us to Belaguo and back was really convenient.
50,Nothing bad to say...no criticism. The Eataly food area is unique and delicious. The casino is spotless and smoke free. Our 3 rooms were all suites and very comfortable. We were there for a college basketball tournament at T-Moble center. This place couldn't be more perfect for that and then everything else offered on the strip.
50,This was my first stay at the Park MGM    Was an absolute perfect experience    Cleanliness and friendly atmosphere great choices for food    Transportation at your fingertips    Consierges we’re very accommodating to help you with reservations for food shows or any questions about your visit    Can’t wait to come back    Thank you    Ron C
50,No smoking is allowed in the casino. Might be a bummer for some but was a selling point for me! Loved it and had a great time. Eataly gives you a lot of food options but you’re close enough to Aria and the Cosmopolitan which also have great food options. It’s also easy to get to CVS or Walgreens if you need it a rarity for other hotels. And easy self-parking albeit $18/night. Glad we stayed here!
50,Such a joy going to the a lot machine and not sitting next to smokers! You'll enjoy that too. Staff is friendly food was great. Definitely a desirable stay. Close to casinos. Housekeeping was great and so was all support staff.
50,Plenty of food options at every price range. Location is perfect. Right next to Tmobile arena. The tram is right there too. The room was basic with no fridge. Shower pressure was amazing! You won't wanna get out. They do need more card dealers because there was waits at craps and 3 card Poker.
30,The location is not great. It is way down on the strip. Waitresses on the casino floor? Nonexistent. Actually paying for a drink at the bar? Different price for the same drink on four different nights.
40,"The check-in / check-out process in all the MGM hotels is very easy with the APP I like that you don't have to stand and wait in long lines anymore. Our room was very clean the bed good. The casino itself is also easy and not a big labyrinth as some of the others. I do miss the ""theme"" here. I prefer the hotels that have a certain theme like ""New York New York"" ""Paris"" ""Venetian"" etc."
50,Hotel was terrific. Great location. Food was diversified. Staff very accommodating. Highly recommend for stay..Price excellent. Easy access to other hotels by trams etc......would stay again. Been to Vegas before and this was great.
50,The staff are top notch. the rooms are very clean. It is as if they all anticipate your needs and make stuff happen I would definitely stay here again. I even won a little bit of money in the casino too.
50,we came to Park MGM to see Aerosmith and the hotel was very clean. The casino was nice and we like that it is a smoke free environment.. we also had room service and the food arrived hot and was very good.. the staff was very friendly and accommodating. we will stay here again..
50,We usually stay at the Park and this time we’re thrilled to learn it is now a SMOKE FREE casino! Clean fresh rooms restaurants and casino. Many great restaurants to choose from great location on the strip.
40,My overall rating of this property is good. My overall rating of this property is good.  My overall rating of this property is good.  My overall rating of this property is good. My overall rating of this property is good. My overall rating of this property is good. My overall rating of this property is good. My overall rating of this property is good.
30,Great location liked the restaurants What a Great name The EATALY it smelled so good there. The Cracked Chicken ? was very good fun place to eat. enjoyed see Aerosmith in concert at the Dolby Live Theater.
40,Central location to south end of Strip with easy access to tram up to Bellagio for North end of Strip makes Park MGM at great place to start from each day. Rooms could be a little better designed but are certainly nice and hotel is a reasonable size to get in and out while still having everything you want. Not as fancy as some for sure but definitely nice and pretty good value all around.
40,In hotel for a weekend NCAA basketball tournament. Room was large and comfortable. Though it was an unusually cool weekend for mid-late November temperature in the room was best with heat/cool completely turned off. Hallways were quite cool on 12th floor but did not bother me. We were offered a room close to elevators when check-in desk clerk noticed my wife was using walking assistance. I accepted and found that despite this central location the location was very very quiet. Hotel is a huge Y-shaped structure with elevators in center and fire exits at very tip of each branch. We fortunately never had to venture to that end. Options for quick coffee in the morning were not ideal. Closest was a food cart and a restaurant in lobby but did not open until 7:00. Next closest was a Starbucks at entrance to casino area but there was always a long line and without coffee my patience is absent. For ordinary coffee the best answer was a short walk to a bar in the center of the betting area where you might find two people at 6:30am playing video poker and drinking a beer. For a standard breakfast after it opens the restaurant in the lobby had a half hour wait for a table when I went but sitting up to the bar was offered. I was able to order from the menu there where I found the bartender Stephen to be very efficient and polite--great bartender personality. All the staff I encountered at the hotel were great. Other food experience was good. Eataly at the end of the casino branch was good but generally packed with people: manageable lines to wait for pastries or gelato or bread or wine but at noon it was not easy to find a table at which to sit to eat something purchased. There is a restaurant in the daytime where a reservation or a wait is required. Service and pasta there was very good. We ate one dinner with a reservation at Toscana the adjacent restaurant. Food and service there was excellent and relatively expensive. Initially our server explained that the antipasta primi and secondi portions were appropriate size for a three course plan but after I ordered both lasagna and braised beef then asked if that would be a lot of food she suggested I order the first and then see half way through if I would need more. She was right--that was enough. Lasagna was not your typical Italian-American home recipe rather one layer of noodle on bottom and the rest ground meat and cheese: very tasty. My wife's ravioli was excellent much like the couple times she ordered it on a trip to Sardinia and Sicily recently. The Tuscan wines were good too though the names were not familiar to us. There were three possible pricey ($100-$160ish each) three-course dinners available including wine but all included steak which seemed odd for an Italian menu. She did say we could request halibut as substitute. This restaurant was not at all full at 7:00--8:00PM on a Sunday night.
30,Zero acknowledgment of Veteran's day which was very disappointing. Rooms are dated and uncomfortable. Doubt I will ever visit this MGM property in the future. Staff friendliness varied greatly from wonderful to down right sour.
50,Love the Park MGM. Made my stay very worthwhile and satisfied. Room is very clean and best of all non-smoking except the annoyance of smokers smoking right outside the entrance. They need to stand somewhere where I don't have to breathe in the unhealthy smoke when I enter the hotel. Food is great. La La Noodle and Eaterly are fantastic!
50,This was my first stay at Park MGM since it was remodeled. The hotel and casino are excellent since it is a nonsmoking facility. The staff is helpful and friendly. All three restaurants were great. This hotel is on my list to stay from now on when I visit Vegas….
50,I come to Vegas to just get out of town before I head home always get a massage and facials Khatera is great at the facials. will come again and again. The MGM Brand I have been staying at over the years
40,Good location with very helpful friendly staff. Had to extend Vegas stay because a friend came down ill and moved to Park MGM for extended stay. Eately food was really good and reasonably priced for Vegas. Will definitely stay there again!
50,The Park MGM is then only smoke free hotel on the strip. It has an excellent location with an easy walk to hotels Botha north and south on the strip and it is directly across from T-Mobile Arena. The hotel is very clean.
50,First time back since the renovations. The property is better than ever. The staff was exceptional. Especially a floor person named Flora Rainone. She answered all my questions about the property and made me feel comfortable and welcomed. Can't wait to go back.
50,Had a great time at the Park MGM very friendly and professional staff room was clean and comfortable. The casino is very complete sits wide assortment of gaming options. Park MGM also has a nice variety of dining choices. Will definitely stay there again!
40,We had a great time! Thanks for the 4 comp room. We bought tickets for 2 shows from hour hotel and really enjoyed them.The guy that helped us was very helpful. Being close to the hockey rink we didn't have to walk very far to watch a game on Nov 15th.
40,Had to order a refrigerator! Coffee Makers not provided!  The best thing about Park MGM is its location. Very easy to get anywhere. T mobile arena is right across the street! Allegiant stadium is a 30 minute walk
50,Everything we go has been wonderful. Modern large and clean rooms great staff easy access to the strip and transportation and best of all a non-smoking casino!!! Eataly Best Friends and LaLaNoodle are great food experiences as well!
50,We were in town to see the Vegas Knights play hockey they didn't win...oh well...we still had a great time. Love the proximity of Park MGM to T-mobile Arena. Had a great time at the casino and eating at the various restaurants with Bavette's being our favorite had two great meals there.
50,Our stay at Park MGM Las Vegas was extremely enjoyable. I really appreciated that the resort was non-smoking close to everything. The staff were helpful courteous and professional. Will definitely stay there again!
50,This casino is top notch not for just the friendly and helpful employees but the smoke free environment is great if you have any sort of breathing issue and your clothes don’t smell terrible during your stay!
30,Park MGM is in a great location on the strip. Having Eately in the hotel was terrific and provided many food options. The sportbetting bar was a good spot as well. The lobby restaurant was overrated and overpriced in my opinion.
50,A retro feel to the rooms keeps it simple and functional. The casino is small but full featured and smoke free. A few more food choices especially quick eats would be helpful but overall delicious options are provided. Easy access to Aria and New York New York open up the options as well.
40,The service was great location was amazing the room was soso. The food was very good. There were alot if restrictions on using our my Vegas rewards. It was definitely worth it to use our points to comp room but then couldn't use free plays.
50,Park MGM - location cleanliness and staff were amazing. The smoke free environment is sustainable and welcoming. We wouldn’t want to stay anywhere else next time that we are in Vegas. We usually get constant headaches from the perfume used to mask smoke smell but not at Park!
40,Elevators were fast rooms were simple but worked ac unit worked when it felt like it pillows sucked Eatily Market was awesome location was great non smoking hotel and casino which was great. We may stay there again.
30,Wasn’t the nicest room for $600 for 2 nights. Toilet wasn’t secured to the ground properly shower handle felt like it was going to come off shower head had build up on it. Only nice thing about the room was the best and location for the concert at the Dolby Live theater
10,Horrible rooms. Dusty. Red velvet couch and walk art that hasn’t been updated probably since the 70’s. Throw up stains visible everywhere. From the minute you get on the elevator and all in the room. Disgusting.
30,Good hotel an over great experience..great service staff  In case you call he hotel directly to stay at the MGM GRAND I would get that in writing twice over.. they did the switch and bait and put us the MGM Park even though I was specific when I called. the reservation desk when we arrived and pushed toward the MGM PARK.. AND WORD FOR WORD.. he Said here is some water and I can not help you.. Both hotel lost my business.
20,Didn’t feel like there was much to do here. Restaurants were mediocre at best. The rooms are very average and our floor smelled like sewage for half the trip. Had to go to other casinos to have fun and getting a taxi was almost non existent.
40,The hotel itself was good and had nice amenities available however I did find the beds to be soft and the bathroom vanity small. The room decor and shower were great and having access to the tram directly from the hotel was awesome! Also the hotel is non smoking which was very nice!
40,I haven’t stayed at this hotel since it was the Monte Carlo. The location is fantastic as you can walk out the door and have many options. There was only $50 Pai Gow which wasn’t good for me. The bedrooms were decent felt a little old and dated but the rooms were Uber dark so sleeping in wasn’t a problem. I would probably stay again if I was attending a concert or game.
20,Pros: pretty close to everything such as the other larger casinos staff was ok nice area  Smoke free    Cons.: room had extremely thin walls air conditioning made some very loud noise  really bad food options felt like I was in the 60’s
50,The stay we had at park mgm was excellent. Made our golf trip for 40 people easy and seemless for us to enjoy. Rooms were great and all the services from housekeeping to check in and out were top notch. Don't plan on staying anywhere else in Vegas other than the park mgm.
50,The hotel and casino were very easy to navigate and it was located very centrally on the strip and it made it easy to go on foot to multiple places on the strip. Also we liked that it was luxurious but not overly fancy. We are more casual people so it was nice to not feel out of place
50,This is a smoke free facility and that has a wonderful and courteous staff. The restaurants were great and the room serve food was delicious. They also have a great rewards program. We are already planning our next visit.
40,Loves the central location of PMGM but rooms lack finish. Rooms have accent elements (bright colors modern fixtures etc) but underlying elements (weathered wall paint overhead wiring was not hidden behind drywall room doors look like Monte Carlo originals etc)
10,This place has not been updated much since it was the Monte Carlo. Rooms are claustrophobic with low ceilings dark furnishings poor lighting. Strong sewage smell on our floor. Resort has tried to remediate deficients with their “stay well” program The air filtration system in the room helped some but did not totally eliminate the smell HVAC wouldn’t cool to set temperature. Beds are uncomfortable (pillows are good). Staff was good but rooms are awful.
50,My score is added up to a few reasons here. 1) We were greeted with amazing customer service along with very quick service. I booked a complimentary stay with park mgm due to gambling quite a bit through the mgm rewards program.    We stayed three nights at the Caesar palace and was utterly disgusted with the constant nickeling and diming they do to their customers. We asked for a couple hours early check in and was told we would have to pay a fee of 45$ for 2 hours. We left and went and registered a reward card from them. And came back talked to someone else 45 mins after the fact and they let us in. Also we went to ask for an hour later check out on our day of check out and was told they couldn’t let us as well as hanging up on us twice.    We came over to park mgm like stated before and was granted early access without an issue. As well as was given $100 dollars in credit to use at any restaurant of our choice etc. Because it was my birthday the day of check in. The experience was great the people were friendly and ultimately we really loved our stay at ParkMgM. The hotel was clean smelled good and the folks there were very friendly. We will definitely come back and gamble a ton of more money at your casinos anytime.    We both have reward cards and both spent a lot of money on your slots and tables let alone we definitely enjoyed the smoke free environment.    We will come stay at the hotel yet again when we come back or when we receive another amazing promotion of free nights at the hotel.    Again we thank you for the best hospitality that we could ask after having such a poor one at Caesar’s and hope you take this review and really give your team a pat on the back as they deserve it tremendously.
20,I was excited to check out this property for the first time but was unfortunately disappointed in my stay. I loved the property overall including the gaming floor dining gym and pool as well as the convenience to other activities and hotels/casinos via the tram. The Nomad bar and Eataly were fabulous. If I were to base the stay on the main floors alone I wouldn’t hesitate to give this a 5-star review since it felt like a real value. However the accommodations were shockingly inferior in quality compared to the rest of the resort. The room we were initially assigned was filthy. There were clumps of dust along the curtains air vents and light fixtures and the furniture and bathroom was very worn. The lowest point of my stay came when to my horror I went to grab a tissue and found a used bandaid inside the box. I was glad to receive a room change but the next room was also very dusty and even had hair from a previous guest still on the shower wall. I was working throughout the day in my room and was surprised when loud music began outside the coliseum below. I expected this side of the hotel to be quieter than the Strip view room and wasn’t warned about it before switching rooms. The guest rooms also did not have amenities that are typical of a four-star hotel—no coffee maker in-kind water bottles or mini-bar/fridge in the room. I am bummed that the guest rooms were so poor in comparison to the rest of the resort otherwise I wouldn’t hesitate to come back again.
40,My family and I really enjoyed our stay here. Casino and sportsbook were great. All of the eateries (especially Betty grill) were awesome. Great central location with access to over half of the strip. Thank you for an awesome stay.
20,I have high praise for all of the staff I came in contact with but the room had no closet no clock no iron nowhere to hang clothing no refrigerator and I was never able to find ice.    The property and rooms were clean but how do you have a room with nowhere to hang clothing at all?
40,Very nice hotel and accommodating staff. Very clean and the beds were comfortable. Every request we made was honored in a timely manner. I would definitely book here again. The only negative was the low lighting in the hallway leading to our room.
30,Not work the money you spend on the room. No coffee maker you have to call room service for $20 boxed coffee plus $9.00 delivery fee. Had to ask 3 times for mini refrigerator to be delivered finally got it second day. Check in staff not overly friendly or knowledgeable. Did not ask if we new about rewards program which we did not.Will not stay their next time.
50,We were able to access all forms of gathering places within the casino for casual talk meals or play at hours that varied. With some experience in Las Vegas I found it charming and convenient with tram access and a good walk.
50,Rooms were clean friendly staff easy check in and check out! Casino was clean lots of machine variety. Water pressure was great. Great pillow quantity and quality. View from room was great. Customer service care was great as well.
50,We love staying at Park MGM. It is not garish and overwhelming like some casinos on the strip. It is on the smaller side which makes it more cozy with a lovely cool vibe. Outstaning Restaurants are on site. We will be back soon and will spend more time at the nice pool area.
50,This was our first time staying at the Park MGM and we had and amazing experience from the front desk to the maintenance gentlemen who help us deal with a small issue but he also immediately compensated us for our troubles even though is was nothing big at all.
50,Great location with easy access to Aria. Eataly was awesome. Lala Noodle restaurant could be better if open during the day as noodles are comfort food for morning or breakfast. Staff was really friendly and mobile check in is very convenient!
20,"The rooms were described as very recently updated but the ""king suite"" room we got was tiny and nasty compared to other properties we have stayed at in Las Vegas. The layout was bad and the execution was very bad. The entire property is strange and cheap feeling. It feels like an off-off-off the strip property instead. Don't plan a romantic trip at this hotel no one will be impressed or comfortable"
40,EATaly is amazing. The club “On the record” was so fun. The bartender named “Bozo” in the hidden speak easy made it memorable and the best drinks! The location was perfect for a short walk to the T-Mobile arena. I would stay again I just wish the rooms were nicer.
50,Great place to stay because of no smoking facility and casino. My only issues is the halls are very long when your room is at the end of one. Next time at my age I will ask for a closer room to the elevators.
40,This was our second stay at the Park MGM. We were here for a show at the Dolby Live Theatre so the convenience of staying on site was definitely worth it. The things we loved were the location (short walk to Bellagio for example) and the fact the entire property is now smoke free. What we didn't enjoy was that our first room was facing the stadium and the plaza where very loud music was playing until the wee hours. We generally are up until at least 2 or 3 am in Vegas but we opted to move to a quieter room our second night because we were getting up early for a road trip. Our room on the pool side of the property was quiet and we had a great sleep.  Rates for our stay were inflated bc of the conventions I assume so we didn't get the value we normally do. No mini fridges or housecoats here but that's fairly common for a standard room. Decor modern. Window seat and table appreciated. Staff friendly and helpful. The pool area is nice. Was pretty cold out but the water was warm.  Disappointed with casino. Tight slots and cocktails pretty much non existent while we were gambling.
30,I am writing this review slowly because I want people to know. If you want to stay at the park MGM and you're a smoker I suggest you not this entire hotel is smoke free facility. The overall hotel cleanliness was pretty good the staff was OK I just had a few issues with not having a coffee or teapot not having a microwave not having a refrigerator they want you to go downstairs to Starbucks and pay 10 to $12 for a hot cup of tea or a hot cup of coffee everyday we were there for 6 days so can you imagine how much we would Spent up by spending money just alone on coffee and tea . Overall the hotel property is average the hotel rooms are outdated and can be upgreat but overall they should have a few more restaurants that's they open at least 24 hours other than that I don't have much more to complain about.
30,I have stayed here a few times. This last room was facing the back alley floor 10. Not the greatest and also end of hallway. Thats what you get when they give you a comp toom deal. I’ll spend the money next time and enjoy a nicer room with a floor to ceiling view.
10,Below average experience at a hotel. Rooms aren’t very nice carpet is dated room is dated and cost is at a premium!! If you are looking for a nice room at 300 a night. DO NOT PICK MGM park. No worth it.
50,The reworking of this location from the Monte Carlo days had been great. I've stayed at Park and Nomad both fantastic. Can't overstate how great the smoke free environment is. Love that. Only thing missing is a buffet...but I know that the thinking on buffets has changed since COVID.
30,Good location. Love the smoke free casino. Dealers were very nice.  Nice line-up of restaurants and bars. The rooms were a bit outdated rooms not the cleanest. Fine for a guys golf trip wouldn't stay there with my wife
50,Had another nice stay at this hotel. Great location/value on the strip. Close to everything. Tables are a little unfriendly (hard to win) and the table minimums are a little high based on the value of the rooms but i'm sure it is supply/demand driven.
10,The rooms are very small and the is no storage space for any of you things. Had a view of a concrete wall so we couldn’t see outside. Had my pouch of jewelry stolen from my room.The only benefit is that it is smoke free.
50,5 UK Guys hit Park Mgm we loved it! We stayed one night at Excalibur and 6 nights at Park so had that as a comparison point.    Park MGM was clean smoke-free and well laid out and we found the location to be excellent for our plans.    I had a stay well nightingale suite which we used as the group base  we tipped housekeepers $5 a day and a fridge appeared 2 days in to our stay and all staff were pleasant and efficient.    I’d seen comments about thin walls but personally did not notice any noise from other rooms.    I would thoroughly recommend.
50,clean rooms. all amenities friendly staff slot machine do pay OFFthe best is the casino floor is NON smoking have to tap room keys in elevator for floor level Security at its bestwe would recommend this casino for future travels and to our friends
50,It was a great friends trip. MGM rewards made the room free. Definitely the best way to go to Vegas is MGM and with rewards. Food was also amazing. Glad I was able to get away to gamble and eat nice food.
50,I love Park MGM! The staff is always friendly and helpful and the food is great! Slots could be a little bit more loose but other than that my overall experience was excellent! I will definitely stay here again!
50,Sandra at the front desk was awesome kind and compassionate during a stressful event we went through. She help us get into a room quickly and knew exactly what we needed. Most of the dealers we had were fun.
50,I had a pleasant experience staying at the Park MGM for a couple of nights. The staff was cool the place smell great. The room was great. The view we had was cool. Such an amazing experience will return.
50,We held our 55th class reunion there & everyone commented on how happy they were with everything provided to us. The rooms were comfortable & very clean. Housekeeping did an excellent job! The hospitality room that we used on Thursday night was perfect for the size of our group.
30,The threadbare carpets and mystery stains embedded in the walls/shower along with some furniture that'd seen better days were all a little off-putting but rooms seemed relatively clean and sanitary enough. Definitely a great location and really excellent restaurants made up for that somewhat. Depending on what side of the building they put you on you may be kept up late by loud music on the strip but hey it's Vegas. That happens everywhere but seems to be more of an issue with older places like this with thinner walls and windows. Yes they did a facelift when they changed this place from the Monte Carlo a few years ago but it's just superficial as far as the room quality goes. Rates were decent for a weekend. Just don't expect 5 star Wynn/Venetian/Aria quality. Good enough for a few nights tho.
50,We have stayed here before and this hotel is great it has a great location very close to everything you want to do. The hotel is very clean and updated the rooms are big and very nice the hotel staff was very nice and helpful. Love the casino lots to play and not over crowded No smoking anywhere in the hotel including the casino that was awesome !!! We definitely will be staying here again !!!
50,Played Blackjack with dealer Louie from PA great night at the table with Louie a very entertaining and profitable couple hours. Will definitely be looing for him the next time in Vegas. Park MGM is our favorite place to play and stay while in Vegas smoke free and great people. Don't forget to have dinner at Best Friend ask for Sam.
50,Wonderful no smoking hotel great food available in Eataly and the staff are beyond helpful and courteous. Love the location on the strip but far enough up the strip to be just a touch quieter. Happy to stay there anytime
50,A great four-night visit began with the MGM app informing me that my room was ready before noon and I could use the app to open my door (no stop at the desk!). I love the location mid-Strip. The room was clean spacious and quiet. Ate at Eataly a couple of times very enjoyable. Recommended and will strongly consider returning to Park MGM!
10,Rooms are very out dated dirty and dingy. We arrived to find used socks in the closet used tissues on the floor and used hair care products. No coffee maker mini fridge or any other amenities in the rooms.
40,"My wife & I booked a room for 4 nights at the Park MGM to suit two primary purposes: proximity to the T-Mobile Arena (right across the street); and the hotel's non-smoking policy within the entire facility (including in the casino). Those two conditions were satisfied & appreciated. The staff from bell service to check-in desk to concierge to food service to housekeeping were very friendly & professional throughout our stay which made our stay more pleasant.    Our ""Park MGM King"" room had plenty of space to move around in a comfortable seating area by the window (our room overlooked the swimming pool & had a narrow view of the Spring Mountains to the west) and sufficient clothing storage space with hangers & drawers tucked in the entry area closet (which also had a safe in the wall). The king bed was very low & not particularly comfortable but that is the least important room feature for the majority of Las Vegas visitors. The lighting fixtures in the bedroom area appeared to be left over from the hotel's previous era as the Monte Carlo while the lighting controls might have been 1960s surplus. We were particularly impressed by the bathroom spacious & modern with a comfortably sized fully enclosed shower stall.    The public areas of the hotel seemed well maintained & kept clean but are not nearly as ""Vegas"" as most of the other Strip hotels (all a matter of tastes & expectations). The non-smoking casino seems comparable in size to the nearby competitors with the usual gaming options. There are a variety of dining establishments at several price points (all on the high side) in the Eataly market beyond the casino space complemented by several other eating & drinking options scattered around the Park MGM & adjacent NoMad suites property. Accessing the free Aria Express elevated tram from the Park property took quite an indoor/covered hike but the service was appreciated as an option to visit & return from the Bellagio Hotel free outdoor fountain show and indoor conservatory display.    If you're looking for a non-glamorous & non-smoking & relatively convenient place to stay at the south end of the Las Vegas Strip we would recommend the Park MGM."
40,Park MGM is a pretty good small-sized casino property in a great location right near the Dolby theatre and T Mobile arena. Okay pool and fitness center. Property is kind of dated but the relatively small size makes check-in and getting to your room easy unlike its giant sibling MGM Grand. Above-average food offerings and nice casino floor. If you are going to a concert or game this is an excellent spot especially if you are a Hyatt member.
30,We stayed one night at the Park Mgm. It is dark room inside. It also had very heavy smell of perfume in room and lobby. The carpet is old and dirty. For the price I would chose different hotel. Location is good
50,Clean rooms nice casino good whiskey nice people in all regards people at check out guest need to learn how to work faster when line is long no chit chat for 20 with one customer while other guy did 10 already
40,Beautiful Hotel. Great food. Sports bar was excellent. Table game minimums were a bit to rich for me. Would have been nice if at least during the day you could get on a $ 10 Table. Other then that great time !!
20,Carpets throughout the guest room areas had large stains lighting fixtures in the rooms are retrofitted plug-in style lights. This is a 70y old building dressed up to look 20. A very unimpressive & disappointing location that carries the MGM brand.
40,Our stay Great location especially between the other MGM resorts. Easy to walk to Excalibur tram and Aria tram. Smoke-free was the real main draw and that was great. Fantastic food options really good casino layout.    Bad: Rooms still really need a lot of work. Felt like they slapped some paint onto the Monte Carlo and called it a day. We had to switch rooms at one point because of 5AM repair work and a super loud neighbor where the doors-between-rooms let too much sound through. The new room had a gap in the shower that let water all over the bathroom floor.
30,Two days prior I stayed at the Conrad Hilton so the comparison may be a bit biased. The Park MGM is a study in contrast on the one hand the Casino and eateries are immaculate well designed inviting exciting and very clean. On the other hand the actual hotel portion does not live up to the standard set by the casino. There was nothing wrong with the rooms. They are clean serviceable and comfortable. (The only problem I had was my digital key didn’t work but that was a minor inconvenience but when you have to go up 22 floors and then back down 22 floors to get it sorted out twice what was an inconvenience became annoying. My advice get the self service physical key before going to your room just in case the digital key fails to open the door and you have to wait for security like I did just get into my room.) The elevator area and hallways leadings to the rooms are another story. The carpet seemed worn and soiled and the lighting in the hallways were so dim I thought the bulbs were going out or they had the wrong wattage bulbs in. At any rate the dim lighting and green carpeting gave it an overall dingy feeling. But that’s only because the Casino is so well maintained and well lit that it becomes clearly obvious that the same amount of care has not been given to the general living area. Unlike the newer Conrad which seems to have the same level of care and detail for the casino as well as the hotel portion of the property. But then again I paid 2 1/2 times more for a room at the Conrad. So it all depends on what you want. If you want a through and through high class experience the Park is not it. If you want a fantastic casino best location and average hotel with good room rates you can’t go wrong with the Park.
10,Smoke free hotel is great but the Park rooms are old and dirty. Stained carpet and couch; chipped tables and chairs; inoperable TV; no microwave or fridge; hair on shower floor; blood stains on bathroom walls
20,for the price of this suite it was not good. The room lay out was bad no refrigerator or micro wave for a suite and having 1 ply toilet paper - newspaper disguised as TP was ridiculous for a suite at a supposedly 5 star room
40,Love the no smoking policy - especially at the tables. Good location and plenty of high end luxury nearby if you prefer higher table minimums. Accommodations are fine. Walls are pretty thin so you may hear your neighbors TV Etc!
50,Excellent facility and staff were exceptionally friendly and attentive to our needs. Very handy for attending activities on the strip. Very centrally located. Parking is easy and access to taxi/ride share is very convenient.
50,From the check in procedures to MGM military rewards program to the mattresses in the room and the drinks on the casino floor. All of it 10/10. Plenty of dining options and a all year heated pool to boot!
10,Horrific housekeeping service!! Our room was never cleaned and our beds were never made from day to day!! Terrible!! I had to call everyday for clean towels and wash rags and they would tell me that they would send housekeeping up to clean and pickup dirty towels although no one ever came to our room. We would return back to our room later that nite to find no one had come to clean! waste of money!!
50,I brought my mom to Vegas for her 76th birthday and the experience from the start was A+!!  The good: We were greeted by Ana Ramos at the front desk. She made sure we had a tub in our room and got us checked out quickly! She was super sweet and really excelled at making us feel welcome. Superb customer service. What an asset to the MGM enterprise! The room was clean and comfy. The linens were crisp and fresh. Best Friend is the place to eat!!  The OK: The shower water pressure could be a lot stronger but the temperature was perfectly hot!  The bad: Nothing bad! Would stay again!
50,We booked at the Park because it was beside T Mobile where we had an event all weekend but the fact that it was smoke free and the staff were all friendly we will be back for the next visit for what ever reason
50,Eataly is phenomenal. Hank really hooked us up with the Happy Hour wine flights! He saw us trying to put a couple of small tables together for our larger party and led us over to an amazing 21+ spot with larger tables and low traffic. Amazing service and wonderful pairings at a reasonable price.
50,I Recents stay at the park MGM was a very pleasant surprise. We got good service in the casino and there was a nice variety of games to be played. The restaurants surrounding the casino had a wide variety of really good quality food with a varying price range that went from inexpensive to four $ a restaurant with excellent food and service
20,You could hear neighbouring blinds being opened like it was right in your own room and any couch or sneeze  Outdated and dreary rooms overpriced  Extremely busy and overcrowded  Could not get even a coffee in the morning in any venue without waiting 25 minutes  My manager had her room cleaned out by security after staying a night abc it took them until 1:30 AM to find where they put her belongings and what happened  Horrible!!!  Later stayed at the Delano and it was delightful and a very welcome refuge as well great value
50,We will stay here again; Smoke-free is a great plus. Eataly and Toscana were fantastic food experiences. Easy check-in and check-out the staff was accommodating and the hotel was centrally located and clean.
50,Restaurants and food were amazing Casino smelt soo clean and not like an ashtray. Bed were very soft and sheets were 1700 count. Very much enjoyed the time in bed after a 10 hr drive. I will definitely stay here again. Prolly next month
30,I do love that this resort is none smoking. And the public areas are beautiful. I even love the friendly staff bartenders bell valet and check-in was a breeze. Linens are nice and comfortable. This visit our room just was not clean. Hair on the ground fingerprints on the light switch.. Room keys from someone else left in a drawer.  Mini bar was food in a tray no refrigerated items.  I love most MGM properties. But I may not want to return to this one.
30,Disappointed with the room. Bed was practically on the floor and uncomfortable to get up from. No dresser. Did have a nice view from our room and it is in close walking distance to shopping Aria and Bellagio tram. Eataly is at the far end of the casino and has wonderful food!! This was the saving grace for this hotel/casino.
10,Representative refused to check me in because I didn’t have to full room deposit. Only after requesting a manager was he willing to proceed. Little did he know I had all my funds in cash. Simple life lesson. Never judge a book by its cover.
50,Nice nonsmoking atmosphere  All staff interactions very accommodating  Convenient location  Restaurants had very good food and service  Having a personal tram to shopping and other hotels such as Bellagio a plus.
40,I love that this hotel and casino is smoke free. That was the main reason why i booked. I had a King room with Strip View. it was as described I wasnt in the room much so not sure if the view is worth the extra price. But my rate was super affordable I would suggest shop around to all the sites. They all have different prices. I used PLine and it turned out ok. The resort fees are $44 a day/per person which is on par for the the strip. I would suggest using all the amenities to get your $44 worth. TV had limited channels but again i wasnt in the room much. There was an issue upon arriving to the hotel the streets were all blocked because there was a rodeo or something at the nearby theater so could not get into the hotel for a while so just bare that in mind. When i called the hotel the receptionist seemed clueless and unhelpful but i guess it was out of their control. But some insight into how to get into the hotel would have been super helpful.  Hallways are dark as some others described but it didnt bother me. Bathroom could use a better cleaning but I always pack Clorox wipes so i just rewiped everything. Location I thought was good on the southside of the strip.  Eataly was awesome wished i tried the Korean BBQ restaurant right next to Eataly Not sure how i missed that but will return next time. I would def stat again the draw for me was the NON-SMOKING hotel and casino!! But Im Baffled that people still smoke!
30,I love the location. If your going to a show it’s nice to be in the hotel there where the show is. But the hallways today dark and the rooms are average need updating for the price i paid for 4 nights
50,We love the location of Park MGM but most of all we love that it is non-smoking on the property as we are very sensitive to cigarette smoke. It is always very well maintained great service and the lodging prices are great. 5 star service with 3 star prices equals great value!
40,Park MGM is perfectly adequate bit not exceptional. Bavette's Steakhouse was fantastic and the fact the Dolby Live area is attached cannot be beat. Other items like the sports bar were subpar and the rooms seem tired -- although they were clean and perfectly fine.
50,I flew in for one night business trip. Shuttle from Airport was easy at $14 cash to the driver. Hotel entrance is off the strip next to the T Mobile arena the area felt safe was clean and nice to look at. The Eataly area was really great. Nice atmosphere lots of options for quick food and the crepe/cafe/pastry cafe was really great in the morning. The room was clean and had a mid centry Las Vegas vibe. TV channel options were abundant beds were comfortable bathroom was nice and clean. The pillows were a little too fat for me so I folded up the spare bed comforter and made do.
50,We will definitely stay here again for a concert we want to see. Smoke-free is a great plus. Eataly and Toscana were amazing food experiences. Easy check-in and check-out with self park using rewards app saved us so much time. Door key tech had glitches but we just printed keys in the lobby with no problem
20,The shower handle didn't work properly so the water was either too cold or blazingly hot. I could hear my neighbor's cough throughout the night. The red contains and the red tiles look very outdated. The hotel didn't give any complimentary water. I would avoid this hotel.
30,Room was good but felt dated. Loved the smoke free casino. Eaterly was confusing found ourselves dining at other hotels. Very convenient for the concert at the Dolby we attended but there are much better room options nearby.
50,I had the chance to meet the table games boss Jimmy in between our games being played. He was accommodating for our group and a really nice guy. I’m coming back to Las Vegas next weekend and have plans to return back to the Park MGM because of the respect that Jimmy showed our group while we were playing at the tables. It’s hard to find a table games boss like him who is personable and accommodating.
50,Had a great experience playing at Park MGM. From our dealer Rossy to the pit supervisor Ian Obrecht. Rossy was so kind and courteous while Ian was so engaging and friendly while making sure everything operated smoothly. It was a great atmosphere and my friends and I will be back as a result.
50,Started out bad. Uber took us to Mgm Grand instead of Park. Never able to get room assigned gnment key thru MGM Tewards app. Room is spacious and yes there was a strip view but since hotel is set back it was limited and also included roof of Park Casino. I know this is Vegas but cone on for this price how about at least a single cup coffee maker and small fridge. Lication was perfect as we saw the Who at their Dolby Theater. Walked to Van Gogh experience and back fro Tim Allen at the Mirage. La La Noodle was tasty but pricey. Primrose good for breakfast. Eatly fine for breakfast sandwich. We had a great short stay all in all.
50,Nothing is cheap in Vegas but some hotels offer value above what you pay. I feel the Park MGM is such a hotel. It's location is excellent for concerts and sporting events. The restaurants are all excellent. I feel the only improvement needed is to provide more light in the hotel room hallways-They're so dark a photo of them will look like a black & white photo.
40,Great location. Pleasant non smoking facility including all casino. . Next to T-Mobile Area . Eataly restaurants on site was plus and Lala Noodles is great. Convenient free tram to crystals shopping and Bellagio hotel
50,Had a great time this weekend at park mgm they allowed us to check in early with our paying a fee and once I got on the casino floor it didn’t smell like smoke. We went to primrose and the food there was amazing 1 pancake will fill you up !!
50,Nice Hotel and Great food a the Eatery. We went to a show at the Dolby Live Theatre. It was right there so we didn't even have to leave the hotel. We slept so nice that I took the sheets off the bed to see if I could find out what kind of mattress were slept on. It was a very nice relaxing trip!
30,Rooms are clean rather small need new carpet. Starting to show its age. With so many other choices I would go elsewhere unless it’s the best deal. Great location makes it better. Comfy bed. Room was dark & hard to see! Good for sleeping though…bad for getting dressed.
30,Not very clean bathrooms need to be better cleaned found hairs in the shower. Tv didn’t work and very loud can hear cars on the strip. Tv was fixed as soon as I called and bell hope was fast and so was valet.
50,Very central location also with a tram to aria and belagio. Eataly is alway fantastic always easy to find something to eat. Waitresses are around with more then some other casinos. Overall a great location
50,I had a great time and stay at the Park MGM. The Staff was excellent and catered to me and my family. When I asked for service they were more than will to go the extra mile for us. The reservations for our restaurant visit was excellent.
40,As a travel agent I put much consideration into this selection. This hotel was best for value and location relative to the concert that I was attending. I also noticed that sports fans were in close proximity to their arena. When we ventured out travel was very convenient. We were located near a plaza connected to the other mgm resorts and very close to a stop on the big top bus tour line. Unfortunately the restaurants that we tried (Best Friends The Eataly and Betty Side Grill) were not that good though.
50,Went to several hockey games & could walk across the street. So convenient! The pool was nice & not crowded in October. The staff were all nice & helpful. Our room didn’t have a fridge or coffee maker so plan on grabbing Starbucks downstairs if you need a morning latte.
40,This was my first time there and I will be back. The smoke free establishment was fantastic. Everything was clean and the staff was excellent. I enjoyed the hotel and it’s location. It was easy access to other properties and the strip.
30,I was a little disappointed with this hotel. As I mentioned before the pool was dirty there’s scum lines along the pool and the lawn chairs inside the pool had scum lines and it was just gross. Also I think it’s ridiculous that you charge $20 for a chair at the pool considering what you pay for everything else. The water in the room $18 is outlandish.
50,We stayed and watched two shows and loved it! Uber was great and very needed. Lots of great places to to eat. This please could use more breakfast places. Prices were really on the ritzy side. Lots to do.
10,Filty room (dusty un vacuumed and dirty carpet) bathroom moldy terrible WiFI scarce reception on TV decor is hideous light bulbs burned absolutely no storage worn and grey sheets and towels bed sunken in and uncomfortable.
50,Came for SEMA ‘22 at the convention center. This place is: Close to everything. Smoke-Free. Clean resort & rooms. Great window view. Easy mobile check in/out. Primrose is 100/10! & I won $1.1k on my first machine. Great trip!
50,At the time of this writing I am still in Park MGM Las Vegas and I keep eating lunch and dinner in Eataly Park MGM Las Vegas. I like the butcher and kitchen and fish eating places. I forgot the names of these 2 eating places but these are close to each other in a single venue.    I particulary love the rib eye steak pork chop fresh oysters and the shrimp and scallop skewers. These are so good.    I also love the gelato here.    I am going to eat here again very soon.    The place is also clean although one has to go early because there are a lot of people eating here too.
40,Good location easy access to monorail and MGM Grand and can use the tram on the ParkMGM side. The entire casino and hotel is non-smoking. Eataly has great options for food. The spa offers great services and was easy to get appointments for services.
10,Housekeeper never cleaned our room. We stayed four nights and five days. She came one time and we were in the room. She said she will return at 6pm and never came back. Our room was never cleaned at all.
40,Hotel is nice. The hallways are really dark walking to the room very similar to the MGM. The velvet couch in the room was nice but visibly dirty. For the price of close to $500 per night I expected perfection.
50,The Park MGM has become one of my new favorite places on the strip. I love it here. The ambiance the views and the location are all amazing. Great restaurants and awesome nightlife. I can’t wait to get back.
10,Nothing noteworthy about this property. Dark and dates No amenities in the room such as refrigerator and coffee. These are basic cost of entry for a business traveler. Good central location to go other places. You won’t want to spend much time here.
10,The Park MGM hotel room is completely indistinguishable from a Motel 6 hotel room. Right down to the crappy towels plastic shelves in the bathroom and maid’s long black hair stuck to the toilet seat.    You got $400 for that room good for you. Fool me once shame on you…. Fool me twice shame on me.  I’ll do my best to avoid your properties from now on.
30,I was very disappointed with the decor cleanliness and overall value. Stayed here while attending the Usher concert. The hallways leading up to the rooms were so dated and dark. The room looked like a basic motel room with dirty dark carpet and walls. The hotel restaurants are mediocre with the majority being Italian cuisine. Do not recommend if where you sleep matters.
50,I love the smoke free rooms and casino. Also the Eataly food court has a lot to offer. Great pastries! Our room was far from the elevator. But the room was clean so they still deserve a 5 star rating. The mobile check in and check out has very efficient.
50,I enjoyed the cleanliness of the room and the easy access. I love that it is a smoke free casino and the staff in the front Desk were super friendly. I also love the perks of being an MGM rewards member.
50,Clean rooms. Straight forward nothing fancy. Great water pressure in the shower. Very convenient location. Directly across the street from T mobile arena. Would be a great place to stay for a concert.
50,We had a great wedding anniversary staying here! Excellent service all through our stay. Always go to the concierge service. They have varieties of good plans and recommendations for your stay. Being the first time going to Vegas we really enjoyed our stay.
50,This is the 3rd time staying at the Park MGM. I cannot say enough about the friendly staff and cleaning services. After a long day of meetings its nice to come back to a spotless room and order dinner in or explore the food choices at the restaurants surrounding the hotel.
50,Stayed here to go to the Usher concert. It was super convenient to just walk downstairs to the show. But the rooms are nice and clean a ton of amenities within walking distance the casino is smoke free which is a huge plus!
30,The rooms were overpriced our room had never been vacuumed in the corners for a long time you can tell around the all edges of the room the bed there was peanut crumbs by the one side of the bed by the night post the floors were never checked the corners of the sinks were never clean properly in the corners... we had to pay $18 a day to park in order to stay at the motel when we rented a car total rip off
50,Loved loved the property. The size the restaurants the whole place is just beautiful. I had a little incident & it was taken care of immediately & was given a gift card for food the next day. And the food was delish.
50,The property is conveniently located I’m the middle of the South Stri. Easy access by tram or walk ways to several hotel casinos. Eataly is a vibrant area out front and provides a variety of food and drink venues. I’m a non-smoker so the casino and rooms without smoke was a plus. My room was smaller than some but up-to-date and very clean.
20,Rooms not as advertised online. They are old with mismatched furniture artwork and poor customer service. Do not get the room service. They charge a fortune to bring you stale food in to-go plastic containers. The room price was astronomical for what was provided.
40,The hotel was a bit dated but clean. There was a great selecton of Slot Machines and great food. Usher was playing the night I stayed the hotel was very accomodating with the number of people there and was staying on top of service
20,Room smelled and a/c didn’t work well. Mold in the shower. Room is outdated. Smelled musty. The sliding door to the bathroom which was the same door to the closet was weird. It just didn’t work. The bed position and TV is not good.
50,Is clean The staff is friendly It does not have some amenities like in room fridge or bath tub but is enough has a walking distance to almost every where and it the Italian food court is really good.  I enjoy my time here
40,My wife and I really enjoyed staying at the Park MGM (formerly the Monte Carlo). The entire property is smoke-free which we really enjoyed. The room was clean and well lit. The shower had great water pressure for our room on the 8th floor. Casino was brightly lit compared to other properties. The thing that keeps me from giving five stars is that there is no mini fridge in the room and the hallways were dark and cold. Had very little interaction with the staff due to using the app for check in and check out. We did enjoy the Eataly area and our meal at the Crack Shack. .
20,The room I checked into had crumbs still on the couch and blinds didn’t go up or down. Had those issues resolved; however the interior quality of the room really isn’t much better than a low level quality Hotel Chain Room that was remodeled 5-7+ years ago. For sure not worth the $250+/night they sold it for. It was a work trip I would have never booked for that price mid week in Vegas. I would for sure not spend my personal money to stay in one of their rooms…maybe if it was comped through casino play it would be worth the price.
10,This hotel is so boring. If you are under the age of 55 this is not the hotel for you. There is no smoking in the casino or anywhere on the property. The room service menu is very limited. If you're not up for breakfast it's pretty much just bar food(wings /burgers/sandwiches). With the exception of the bathrooms the room decor is very dated. The furniture in the room was soiled and there were scratch marks in the paint on the walls. It was a little disturbing to see. I ended up spending all my time in other hotels on the strip.
20,The customer service at this hotel was awful. The phone representative was rude and basically told me it’s not their responsibility to assure the right check in amount is specified. I planned a girls trip and it started off horrible based on customer service. In person they were nicer and attempted to help make things better. But the phone representative had already ruined it for me. The hotel is nice but I would not book again. Customer service is important to me. I’d like to spend my money where I am treated well. The staff is unaware of what rooms adjoined to what which we specified that need months prior. Only to be told misinformation. The assistant manager was nice though. But I want them to see how customer service will always be a big deal and failing on that cost them 4/5 ratings
30,For a little more money you can stay at a higher end experience like Wynn encore. We found the host staff at all the restaurants to be incredibly rude. The serving staff was excellent. The rooms have been redone from the old Montecarlo but they are very average.
50,By far our favorite hotel! Quiet clean spacious great restaurants what’s not to love when in Vegas! Highly recommend to anyone going to Vegas😊 you won’t be disappointed! We stayed in the Night Hawk Suite which is large very spacious and comfortable definitely stay here again!
50,From Check in to Check out this was a great experience. The no-smoking policy is amazing! I love it here and I am officially a customer for life! I love that the concert was right in the hotel and I loved going to Eataly. I can't wait to go back to visit! Any time I am in Vegas I am only staying here!
30,The Park MGM is average a best. The rooms are fine beds decent but there is a funny smell in the hallways. The saving grace of the hotel is that they Eatly which is one of the best Italian eateries grocery store cafe gelato bar and wine bar. If you love Italian food you will not be disappointed.
50,Excellent the one of the best hotel along the strip. Casino is the only non smoking area along the strip.Verr nice and convenient location along the strip. Near convenience store like target and CVS.. Varieties of testaurants nearby and gift stores !
50,The pit boss Ian did a great job keeping us engaged and satisfied with our stay while playing blackjack. Ian Dusco and Meesay had customer service skills. It was much appreciated on Saturday 10/29/2022.
50,Me and 9 of my friends went to Vegas to see Usher in concert. The concert was at Park MGM and so we decided to stay there for convenience. The accommodations were great. The hotel is in a wonderful location and an easy walk to other casinos and restaurants. However the restaurants in Park were great. We loved LaLa’s noodles. The Pad Thai was fabulous!
50,Loved that ALL of the property is smoke free! Friendly staff along with many wonderful amenities and the property is the perfect size! Has an awesome section designated towards Italian food/EATERY! We highly recommend this resort!
50,This place is fantastic. In the future I will book further ahead to get a better rate but out of the 6 places I have stayed in on the strip in Vegas this has hands down been the best place for me. Thank you!
50,Nice smoke fee resort. Heated pool was amazing. Pool staff was great. Front desk personnel were very nice and helpful. Primose restaurant had excellent food and service. Friends and I had a very enjoyable stay.
30,It was soooo dark in thereeven in the roomsapart from that it was goodthe bed was very comfortableand the staff we met were nicethe bars are nice especially the sports bar and the late cocktail bar
40,Although it’s a busier casino due to hockey games and concert I’ll definitely come back because it’s non-smoking casino. All room should be provided with mini fridge so that customer like me don’t have to go walk far to get ice from the ice machine.
50,My 12 year old son and I had the best time. It was clean and quiet at night which was wonderful. The staff are very accommodating. The Italian food was dynamite. Such a great location. Close to all of our events including the Golden Knights game! We loved it there.
10,The room was unclean upon check-in. Can see dust settled on the furniture and headboard of the bed. The bathroom shower stall not toilet was clean although the hotel charges a resort fee per night. I would not recommend.
30,Everything was great AFTER the first night. The first night no towels waiting 30-40 mins for towels after getting in for the night which was waaaay after midnight. Good thing we packed our own soap and lotion because nothing was refilled.. However after the first night we didn’t have any other issues
40,My event was at TMobile. I had great photo opportunities from the room and couldn't get much closer. It was also a good location for other restaurants and casinos. I had to transfer two of my rooms to other people and online customer service was excellent.
50,The staff here is exceptional and exceeded all my needs. The cashiers front desk concierge etc…are all phenomenal. You can tell they value their service and their patrons’ needs. Will be staying at all MGM resorts moving forward!
20,Room quality Motel 6. Needs updating. Good location. Halls are very long for anyone with problems walking. Had view of a wall. No amenities. Towels were gray and old. Limited storage space in bathroom
50,Dod not plan on writing anything. See below for what I think of the place. That pretty much covers it. I came I saw I played I had a good time. And now I need to type more than 200 characters. Honestly I'm not that interesting...
10,For my first experience in Vegas I just expected more - or at least something better than basic. This hotel met our needs on a bare minimum level without anything special for our 2-night investment. There wasn't even any water in the room for goodness sake. Only one chair at the table. No menu for the dining options. Park MGM is a sorry excuse for a hotel and a huge rip-off financially.
20,The rooms and the hallways smelled like sewer. I thought on day 1 that it may have been an issue but it persisted the entire stay. There was hair in my shower when I checked in. Long black hair. I’m bald. Know it wasn’t mine.
50,and enjoy this smoke-free hotel and casino. The rooms provide the basics of what you need and are clean! The hotel is beautiful the staff is exceptional and Eataly is delicious! With a walk through the hotel to Aria the free tram is an added bonus with an easy and quick way to the Belagio and the heart of Vegas. Park MGM is my go to the next time I visit.
30,The room was like an add on room. The Dresser was stuck in a closet couch stained with semen leather chair is peeling and cracking had to wait a pretty long time to get our bags. The make shift wiring/tubing made it look and feel like an older hotel room trying to make it look decent. Just surprised thought we were staying at a better hotel. For the prices of the room I expected better.
30,If you’re attending a concert at the Dolby Theater then staying at this hotel is convenient. Otherwise it’s not a luxurious resort experience and is a bit pricey for what you get. No coffee maker no fridge no microwave and no room service. But the casino is completely non-smoking (except for the high limit area —where smoking cigars is allowed apparently).
10,Very very disappointed. Basically the only usable thing in our room was the bed. For the price we paid this is bad. To add insult to injury the TV service went out late Friday night and some still out when we checked out Saturday morning.    For example why would there not be towel racks in the bathroom?
30,Park MGM was very dirty and casino staff wasn’t very friendly. Felt like staying at a non-known hotel instead of an MGM hotel The hallway was never vacuumed and it smelled badly! For a renovated hotel they missed out on alot of improvements
30,Just stayed here for the first time. Wanted to love it. The rooms are spacious. Love that Park is smoke free. The mobile check in is very easy. But the the hallways are dark and smelly. There is a strong stinky sewer smell. It unfortunately extends to the room as well.
30,Had a good experience at the Park MGM a year ago so decided to check in there again ... but I have to say standards are starting to slip a bit. The first room they allocated me to on the 13th floor wasn't great: aircon started making a big racket in the early hours of the morning and the bedside phone started sending out flashes of green light every few minutes. I tried to phone down to reception to ask about another room - but the phone didn't work. Got up and got dressed to go downstairs and realised that somebody had been trying to get into the room while I was sleeping - I'd heard the handle turning twice but thought it was the nextdoor neighbour; when I went to step outside I noticed a long piece of dental floss on the floor (which definitely WASN'T there earlier!) and another one on the outside of the door ... looked it up online and learnt that that's something burglars do to flip the latch from the outside! This time it hadn't worked - but was a bit scary anyway! They gave me a room on the 12th floor which was mostly OK - comfy bed and pillows good shower etc - but somebody in another room was smoking a lot of weed (in a non-smoking hotel). Also the electronic key card didn't work on three separate occasions meaning I had to shlepp down to reception and get another one. All that aside Park MGM is still fair value for money in a good location and the smoke-free policy is a bonus. I just hope they stop the slide in standards before it goes too far...
50,The staff was friendly rooms very clean great entertainment and wonderful food. The Usher concert was exceptional and all the guests and restaurant staff I encountered was so friendly. Thank you for the memories .
30,My sister and I traveled to Vegas for a concert. The hotel was decent and served it purpose. The beds were clean and comfortable. The bathrooms could have used some attention and some of the decor were worn and dated (sofa/tables).
20,Again to elaborate. This room was not gaged towards business-friendly. There is no designated workspace just a lounge chair with a table which makes it extremely hard to work. Furthermore the Internet was absolutely terrible making work nearly impossible. I had to work from from other facilities
30,Room was not clean due to found condom under bed. Couch didnt feel clean and had odd material that felt old and outdated. Table in room was felt old and heavily used. Lack of desk to work is irritating. Room felt like an expensive motel 6.
50,Nice to walk into a smoke free environment. Loved that you could order ahead at starbucks. Loved the lady gaga store/museum. Received major help placing my first bet at the BETMGM which seemed like a must to get my settings perfected. Easy to get to aria and belagio cosmo and MGM grand. Rooms were not fancy but nice I would stay again
40,The room wasn’t perfectly clean when we checked in. I left a tip for housekeeping and they fixed everything. The staff is courteous and prompt when you need anything. The restaurants club venue are very nice. I would definitely stay here again!!
40,Great room plenty of space for two wonderful view of mountains very clean very quiet lots of outlets for charging up electrical devices and bed facing window was nice surprise for added view enjoyment. Only downside was not having a mini fridge….. otherwise great room.
40,I finally used MyVegasSlots free room. Parkmgm is a clean hotel and smoke free. the rewards desk are not to friendly. But the room are nice and clean and Casino area was very clean. Smoke free Casino .
50,We went to see the Leafs vs Vegas and spend a couple days in town and this was the perfect place to stay! The location was in the heart of the action on the strip and right next to TMobile Arena and the outdoor area called The Park! Eataly at the front of the building was an incredible place to have a meal and spend time so many good choices there! The staff were all very friendly and accommodating with anything you needed and really enhanced the stay! The room was very nice with a great view of everything!
30,Be ready to pay big bucks on Parking even if you're a guest. Everyday of our stay we had to get our cards resetted. No mini refrigerator or dresser. It would be nice to have some restaurants available like a Cafe for anytime dinning.
50,The hotel is lovely and the entire staff was very accommodating. Being a smokeless property is very valuable to me.    The room was sizable very clean and comfortable.    This was my second time there and it will be my 1 st choice on my next visit.
30,Rooms are from the 80s. Carpet was dirty and holes in sheets. Food was overpriced and staff at the bars weren’t friendly. If you charge twenty bucks for a drink you should be friendly at least. This place needs a facelift
40,Nice property. Great location. Good water pressure comfy beds and pillows. Automated check in/out. Daily housekeeping and nice staff. Bavettes restaurant is great but could use longer hours. Slots are tight.
50,Park MGM was wonderful..not to big so it was easy to get around. You could go from eating to the casino out to the strip. The best part is it's NON SMOKING!!! The rooms were very comforatableslept well every night. The Primrose is a great place for breakfast and a cocktail at the bar. Overall I would highly recommend staying here!!
50,This was definitely a great place to stay. Me and my girls…(girls trip) went to see Usher…oh my gosh…Best show ever!! but the location of the this hotel and the venue you can’t beat…literally come downstairs and the venue is right there didn’t have to leave the hotel…customer service was fantastic!! Fun friendly environment. I will definitely be staying again!!!
50,The stay and experience was awesome. I was recommend this hotel to family members and friends. The rooms were every spacious and nice. Room service and housekeeping did a very good job with their service.
50,There’s action and great dining when you want it. But cool refreshing restful hotel rooms when you just want downtime. It’s far enough away from the strip to feel exclusive but close enough to join the throng if you want to.
50,Awesome crapless crap table is also in smoke free casino. Doesn't get any better than this. Terrific restaurants. Love Side Betty Primrose and Starbucks. Juniper lounge serves swanky cocktails in an old vegas feel complete with Frank Sinatra singing. My favorite casino. Beautiful fresh clean rooms. No smoke anywhere.
20,The king strip view was just a basic nothing special room. There were no dressers or shelves. There was an armoire in the room with a few hangers. It had one very tall shelf I couldn't reach and a low shelf that had an ice bucket on it. We just lived out of the suitcases. The bed was comfortable. The room was nothing special.
30,The room itself is adequate. The concern is that the hotel allows pets to stay in any room no designated rooms. Next guest is subject to possible allergic reaction to previous pets in the room. Room overlooking TMobile arena is very loud from extra noise especially during hockey games also traffic can be heard from upper floors too.
50,Quiet & clean hotel property. I was able to look out my window & see the hockey stadium. Great food options in the hotel & we only left the property once. Highly recommend this property while in Vegas
50,"Everything was excellent-from arrival through departure. The room Nightingale Suite was very nice and spacious. Also the room had a remarkable view. The only thing I would have wanted was a birthday ""perk"" for Rewards Members. The Primrose Restaurant was exceptional. Staff was very knowledgeable of menu's items."
50,This was a very nice hotel and it’s located near restaurants that I enjoyed . It’s also a Smoke-free casino which is a big plus for me . I would definitely book here again . If you enjoy Italian food try EATLY it’s located right outside the casino . :)
50,Park MGM is located close to New York New York and Mandalay Bay.  It's a great location especially since Dolby Live is located inside and was perfect especially since we were there to see Usher. His show was phenomenal. The few workers that I did come in contact with were nice and friendly.
40,Great location clean don't prepay for parking just pay as you go I was charged double. Lessoned learned. You have to pay to have a fridge in your room which I find odd. Its 2022 that should come with the room. All in all it was a nice place.
30,Rooms are clean but the walls are really thin! I had to be up early because I was there for work - the people next to me where there to party so our schedules didn't match so well and I could hear them loud and clear!  If you are travelling for business (Convention Center) I would avoid this hotel as it is not easy to get to the Convention Center (taxi or Uber is must). There are better choices on the strip for this kind of trip.  It was also difficult to get breakfast in the morning since Starbucks is the only option. It does get crowed in the morning. Service was fast but options for food are very limited. If you are travelling for leasure then you can take your time and go eat elsewhere which is not possible when travelling for work.  There is no WOW factor to this hotel. It's just ok does the job. We spent our evenings at other hotels in other casinos.  It's not the worst hotel in Vegas that I've seen but not the best. It sit right there in the middle ready to be forgotten.
50,We loved the MGM park...the rooms were very clean. Beds super comfortable. There was plenty of room for a suitcase and enough drawers for clothes..how many clothes do you need for 4 days in Vegas? The pools were awesome and the non smoking casino was refreshing
40,The staff were great. Casino smoke free made for an enjoyable time. Servers and emo in the casino were kind and attentive. The hallways and some bathrooms were very dark. Room was modern beds comfortable and veiw of the arena activities was great.
30,The experience at park mgm was ok. No room service was provided on a 3 night stay that was very disappointing. Table games were $50 minimum was not pleased with that. Food was excellent all the Italian style eateries in the park mgm we’re amazing
50,Usually stay at NYNY Excalibur or Luxor. Park MGM was a pleasant surprise. Great location. Lots of dining options inside and nearby. We stayed in a Nighthawk suite - roomy comfy clean 2 tvs. Loved the smoke free hotel and casino. So refreshing compared to the other resorts. Casino not overwhelmingly big but lots of options and the slots were paying!! Loved La La Noodles too. Will definitely stay there again.
40,I have stayed at this location several times. Its in a really good location on the strip. The issue that I have is that it does not have a refrigerator. I like to keep water in my room and i prefer it cold. This is the only thing keeping me from giving it a perfect score.
20,We had to move twice because of how filthy the rooms were. On the third room we were assured that a hotel manager would personally inspect the room. The inspection must have missed the thick dust on the carpet and in the bathroom. The guest elevators and hallways also had a really weird smell. It's disappointing because Eataly is great and the casino has good restaurants and shops... but we won't stay there again if they can't clean rooms decently.
50,I always choose this property because it's close to New york New york and the stadium. also the restaurants are great the breakfast place the the lobby love it.. The main bar the staff is super friendly..
20,The rooms weren't cleaned well. The comforter had a blood stain on it. Not even a faded stain. They didn't attempt to wash the comforter before placing it on the bed in between guests. The towels in the bathroom had stains on them. And there was a sewer smell that wafted in the room throughout the night.
10,Room wasn't ready at 9:00 pm and promised to put me in another room but they didn’t. Also I wasn't informed about the resort fees.  The rooms are outdated and housekeeping comes in without knocking and don’t clean well!
50,Very quite rooms. Staff was always there when you needed them weather in the casino at the bar or checking in. Very helpful and friendly. I have already recommended to friends. We usually stay in 4 star hotels and this exceeded my expectations. Thanks
40,The property and staff were very adequate but the location was a little inconvenience for us (off of the main strip).  It wasn't convenient to move around to locations we wanted to visit without using transportation (it became expensive).
40,The price was surprising affordable staff was great. I also liked being nearby all great dining options. A huge plus was that this hotel is completely smoke free so you can wear your jeans again the next day!
50,Rooms are good..:staff is very friendly…restaurants are great! This is a great value hotel. We stay here all the time and love the staff and location. Easy to get to Aria/Belagio/NYNY/MGM Grand. Bavettes is a fabulous restaurant as is LALA Noodles
40,Nice suite could have used a little more decoration    Level 2 smells funny    Great location on the strip    Check in and checkout was awesome and fast    Food options were good    Liked Eataly for coffee    More waitresses for drinks would be nice
20,I have stayed at Park MGM over 10 times since 2019. It's my main hotel in Vegas. Good location rooms and food BUT this past weekend I come to the realization front desk people are CLUELESS. I checked in on the APP while I was still at the airport and added my credit card I also added my friend to the reservation. Since it was close to 3pm checking in time I told my friend who was already on property to see if the room was ready. At the front desk they got her to check in when she was not the main person on the reservation deleted my credit card from the reservation and forced her to give her card when she was not the main person on the reservation. Why would they do that when they already have my card that i added on the app for the check in? Also I called for my folio 3 times and still do not have it
30,Park mgm is a great location . It is across from Marshall’s and target ( 5-10 ) walk !  We stayed in a stay well room which i thought was pretty average . Comfortable beds and clean . A few weird things though … no fan in the bathroom and no lock on the bathroom door . For a group of girls staying in one room this wasn’t great. we had to announce that we were using the bathroom so no one would walk in .. and if your taking a number 2 there was no way to vent any sort of smell .  The pool area is beautiful .. clean and has lots of space to swim and lounge . Feel like the secret garden with all the archways and plants and trees . In October the hours are 9-5 pm . A bit disappointed since we wanted to take an eve swim and couldn’t . Pool was warm .
50,Non smoking facility is perfect we loved it and will come back again for sure the staffs are friendly but in the casino they don’t have blended drink oh well and the facility is clean and well kept..
10,bummer the place smelled so bad when we checked in because the food was delicious. Rooms upstairs were clearly redone cheaply which is a bummer because downstairs is pretty cool. I felt like our hotel room was made over by holiday inn and Virgin Atlantic Airlines. We had red walls and red tiles in our bathroom that was about it. Not even enough room for a mini bar or chest of drawers to sit our purses on. upstairs hallways were low and popcorn ceiling.
50,I loved Park MGM and all it had to offer. They have many outstanding dining options right on property. Close proximity to a host of attractions and tons of other restaurants. If you’re attending an event at Dolby Live it’s a no brained this is the place to stay. Also steps away from T Mobile arena. The rooms were nice and the staff I encountered were great. 10/10 in my book.
50,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Park MGM. Everything is beautifully decorated amazing meal options and centrally located on the Strip. We will recommend this destination to friends and family as well as co-workers.
30,Second time at Park MGM. Nice hotel great location. Service has some to be desired. The front desk was their saving grace. The Primrose treated my dad like a king and that was awesome to see. His first trip to Vegas in along time.
40,The location of the hotel is great. Everything was good almost prefect except a few things. Although the hotel was really clean we did see a bug in our room and our room phone did not work which was inconvenient.
30,This hotel is okay but the rooms are not new they appear to be old with some recent updates and a new casino attached. Old wiring no modern amenities such as usb chargers and old lighting and cabling. You can hear through the walls to the next room.    Everything is extremely expensive including the gift shop with crazy expensive prices. The food in the Primrose Cafe is good as are the staff. We also tried the Bavette steakhouse great atmosphere but food way too salty. Overall I was disappointed and wished I had booked a different hotel on the strip.
50,Initial issues with room cleanliness were sorted out quickly. Staff very helpful particularly Mica. Non smoking casino a big plus. Events at T-Mobile Arena can make self-parking tricky at times. Overall a good experience.
50,Park MGM I found had modernized how check in should be. They can managed the crowd well using computers to ease the check in with minimal human interventions. People visiting Las Vegas wants to maximize their stay and lining up to get to your room is not a favorite.
50,"Park MGM was an excellent choice for my 40th birthday trip with girlfriends. Location was perfect and we loved that it was smoke-free. We had a few hiccups but none of them deal breakers: housekeeping did not come through the day to refresh our room; we were out from 10am to 5:30pm had to call to ask for someone to come and attend to our room when we got back. It would have also been nice to have had a mini fridge in our room but I know these are basic ""no frills"" types of stays. The ice machine on our floor was broken so we had to ask someone from housekeeping to bring up ice for us each day. Other than these minor ""issues"" we had a lovely time the staff were all friendly and wonderful from booking all the way to check out. We hope to be back soon!"
50,the hotel accommodations was great very happy that the hotel was smoke free! Was very happy that the weather allowed us to enjoy the pool and that they provided free bottle water at the pool. Perfect place to stay and see a concert.
20,I would not recommend this hotel. I chose this hotel because I had tickets to the Usher residency and figured it was best to stay at the hotel for convenience's sake. I'd recommend staying at the nearby hotel Aria instead.  I chose mobile check-in and digital key on the app. During my online check-in I chose no housekeeping for my stay which ended up not mattering because housekeeping cleaned my room every day. When I walked in my room I was shocked at how outdated it was. The carpet is very sad. it needs to be removed from all of the rooms. The red color used is an assault to the eyes. There is one window that isn't that big and the worst offense is that the walls are so thin you can hear your neighbors' conversations.
30,Parking is a pain especially if there’s an event going on staff friendliness and helpfulness was nonexistent the three dealers we had were kind of rude and not very friendly they made it seem like you we’re not important. Italian food court was great he had a lot of options to choose from and food was above average. Room is very nice updated and clean.
20,The place has no personality and it smells like sewer. The halls looked like something from The Shining! Strip view was a view of roof tops.. Receptionist tried to tell us even tho we paid for early check in we can’t check in till 1 then after 15 minutes of her ignoring us as she’s on the phone we got our room.. Eataly just wasn’t my vibe.. The best thing about this place is the tram and shopping across the street..
50,We had to find a hotel last minute and we chose this one for its cheap pricing on a friday night and it was still a 5 star experience. 10/10 across the board. Well done. About 153.42 for the night before a major concert. Good pricing.
40,I stayed at the Park MGM for 4 nights. Check in was quite smooth although on other days I did see more lineups. I asked for upgrade but not available although the nice lady give me strip view and put a credit on my account. The strip view meant you could get a look at the strip past the other parts of the hotel (not really close to the strip). Room was spacious and had a nice sofa bench near the window. Beds were comfortable and amenities were on the medium quality level. The room was comfortable but you could see the furniture and carpets were a bit worn but still clean.    We were on the 15th floor. The bottom 22 floors is the Park MGM and above is the Delano (which I believe is a bit higher end). There is night club that plays thumping music until 2 or 3 am on Friday and Saturdays. Not really loud but you can hear the thumping so if you get used to it it isn't too bad. It is Vegas so you do have random people shouting loudly in the hallways in the early morning hours. Seems like walls a bit thin as I can hear when people above us are using the shower. Beds are really comfortable.    It is nice that the whole hotel including the casino is smoke free. There is also an Italian food court called Eataly attached to the hotel. This is very convenient for getting breakfast or lunch. Staff are pretty friendly. There is also an exercise facility and pool but we didn't use either.    It is mid strip so quite convenient. You can get on the free trams that take you Aria and you can walk over to the Excalibur and take the tram to Mandalay Bay. Right across the street there is Walgreens and Target so you can get water snacks booze etc.    Quite a nice place to stay. I would consider a mid tier property but very convenient.
50,this is a lovely hotel situated just adjacent to the Tmobile arena which makes It very convenient. Its also not filled with a bunch of rowdy fools like many other resorts. and the nomad on the top floors is very nice. Great hotel on the strip for a decent value. The staff was exceptional and any issues we had they were immediately handled with kindness and generosity.
40,The Park MGM is a nice remodel of an older hotel building. Some vestiages of the old builing remain such as the extremely low ceilings in the hallways. Rooms are nice enough definitely a strong 3+ stars. Hotel is not as busy as others in this location and is somewhat centrally located and its fairly easy to get to the Monorail for locations further North on the strip. Eataly has decent food nothing spectacular but doable. Close to alot of other food venues for every price point. Overall I would stay here again. I will note that the walls are extremely thin so if your neighbors are loud that may greatly affect your experience. Dolby Live is good for concerts and its nice to be in the same hotel as that venue.
20,No dresser. No shelves in the bathroom. No coffee maker in the room. No refrigerator. There is a wardrobe with four hangers and two shelves. Oh but there's a really long couch so I guess you can pile your underwear and socks there like I did.  Ridiculous.
30,Stay at this hotel last year and had a great experience. The year was different. Disgusted to find fake eyelashes next to the snack tray in the room when we arrived. At the pool there used to be lounge chairs by the main pool last year. Now everything is and up-charge with reservations or for Nomad guests only. The loungers that are available for the hotel guests without reservations are tucked in the back corner with little direct sunlight. Truly disappointing after paying $1k for two nights!
50,The hotel is beautiful and the staff were really friendly. Walking around the casino was easy for the four of us including our friends. I never wanted to leave because the other hotels were packed in like sardines! Very cozy room and stay.
20,Basic...felt like a dirty motel..........Casino and restaurant were nice. Not worth the price.    Spa was nice and clean but the therapist was not experience in actual massage or anything beyond a Swedish push around your back...Not worth the price
50,My stay at park mgm was great! It’s in a good location it was very clean smoke free and just a perfect hotel for our stay. The meals are a bit pricey so we decided to eat elsewhere on the strip but this will be our hotel of choice moving forward
20,Great location Great food beautiful casino and just great amenities overall but rooms were not impressive for the price. Room had numerous problems. Window problems shower problems and room floors had a horrible smell.
50,Such great entertainment in a not overwhelmingly huge property. Awesome restaurants (Best Friend and Bavett’s are solid choices) a well equipped non-smoking gaming environment and perfect location at the center of everything Vegas. Definitely looking forward to my next stay.
30,The hotels central strip location was nice the employees were polite & we especially appreciated the no smoking policy. The rooms were pretty dated but clean. The AC struggled to keep up but the beds were terrible. We stayed in a Stay Well room & the beds were so hard! Everyone complained & my son moved to the little couch in the room. We knew we only had one night but there is no way we would have been able to do another night on those beds as no one got much rest. If the beds had been comfortable it would be a 4 star review.
10,"Avoid this hotel at all costs rooms are unbelievable dirty. We arrived on a Mon evening at 7pm and instantly before a hello welcome etc. was told we have no Kings left you will have to take a Queen and we'll get you a King room tomorrow. Ok no biggie strange though as it was a Mon & only 7pm and I have checked in on Fri/Sat's at 10pm+ and never heard this before but fine. So completed check in and asked what the process was on moving to the King tomorrow. Then was flippantly told ""yea you can always come down and ask us 2m and we'll check if we have anything no guarantees!! Yet he previously made it sound like we would only have Queen for a night. Now we were booked in for 2 weeks. So whatever went to room and could have cried!!! it was filthy there was dust everywhere and I do mean everywhere. We both tried to ignore it at first but the more we moved into the room it was impossible to ignore. Not sure if room hadn't been used in months as it definitely looked like it hadn't been cleaned in months. So had to go down to request new room as my wife suffers from allergies and within 2 mins in the room it was even starting to set me off and it would have destroyed her. When I explained that the room was dirty and looked like it hadn't been cleaned in ages and that it was unacceptable. I didn't mind taking a Queen room over ny booked King room but not a dusty room the guy actually said ""is it just that it stinks and smells musty??"" Couldn't believe this statement now granted the hallways do smell musty and the carpets are filfty but for a staff member to say so off the cuff says it all. I explained the room was dusty all over hell I even tried to give him a get out of jail free card saying I know hotel is busy so that room perhaps hasn't been used it a while!! Lol but he knew the place was dirty lol so he got on phone then instantly said can't move you tonight manager says we aren't doing that as we are busy. Shocked and I mean shocked I said sorry that's not gonna work had to explain my wife's allergies in great detail. Again on phone finally ok try this room. Long story short it was better but still not what I expected from a non smoking hotel from MGM. The cleaning staff were v pleasant when meeting them in hallways but they don't clean the rooms the simply replace towels. Eventually had to move to Vdara OMG the difference night and day!!! Especially when the price was practically the same. Now Parks location is good but not worth living in dirty and the fact that staff didn't seem surprised or apologise for it and weren't even gonna try and fix the issue only I had to go into great detail about my wife's allergies. I mean he didn't even say I'll send maids up to clean it and come back in an hour. Hell anything apart from deal with it come back 2m after 2pm and we'll see if we have any other rooms but no guarantees!!! Look no-one with any standards would want to stay in that 1st room unless they were too scared to complain or high!!! I expected alot more from a MGM property especially one that is non smoking. Absolutely shocking go elsewhere and save yourself."
50,This hotel is nonsmoking which is a winner for us. We had a beautiful view of the strip and we caught the sunrise over the mountains daily. The beds are really comfortable and sitting in them watching the sunrise is beyond relaxing. The shower felt like spa!
10,Room was dirty had no space to put clothing or belongings for one person much less two. Furniture was old and damaged and sink didn’t have hot water. The casino and restaurants were nice but very disappointed with the room.
50,Very nice hotel. The room was clean and comfortable.Very convenient having a theater in hotel for concert performance.  Primrose restaurant also located inside is excellent. The staff is very nice as well and professional. I would definitely go back especially to the spa!!
50,Think about walking into a hotel that smells more like a spa! That’s what you smell when you walk into PARK MGM. All the other casinos have a stale smoke smell. Some more faint than others but there’s a smell. The smell coming into park is very pleasant. Thank you for a no smoking hotel & casino!!
10,Loud can hear everything from T-Mobile arena. Rooms are old and dirty. Staff are not willing to help. Not worth the $$$$$. Stay sobrang else. Even their suite was not worth the money just a big space 0 amenities. I don’t know what the purpose is of the $40 nightly charge. You still have to pay for parking.
30,Location was great. Right in the middle of actions on the Strip. Housekeeping was very poor. One night with trash in a vinyl bag on the chair the other night toilet not cleaned. Do not disturb sign we asked for never arrived. Room was very basic and without refrigerator. The sliding door for restroom is actually the door for the closet. You cannot close the restroom and the closet at the same time.
40,Great price for a recently renovated resort in a good spot on the strip. Rooms were clean casino has more affordable tables than most strip casinos they have a nice selection of places to eat. Tram that goes to Bellagio Arya and the upscale mall shops at crystals.  The entire resort is smoke free as a non-smoker it is nice to go back to your room and not have to immediatly shower and change to get the stale smoke stink off.
50,Only problem I had was that my deep dish pancake was cold when delivered to my room and the individual who took the order had an attitude but overall nice hotel and conveniently located to restaurants and shopping.
50,Park MGM is perfect for its location group trips and its many options for food and drinks like the famous Eataly. The smoke free setting is the absolute best because you can actually breathe and feel comfortable during your stay.
50,The concert venue was excellent and the show was great as well. The staff was very friendly. I would definitely stay here again. I also loved the free parking since I had a rental. It made going and coming a lot more convenient.
30,The location is perfect for kids. Nyny and Excalibur are nearby with arcades. The 4th floor room was ok except the view was really sad and the carpet had a lot of stains. Food at eataly and lala noodle was ok. Nice to breathe fresh air after getting smoked out at other casinos and on the strip.
20,I expected more and got way less. The room was so basic. And wasn't properly cleaned. The previous guest trash was still in the trash can. The sink and the shower looked like they have never seen cleaner. Trying to get these things addressed was a pain. It never happened. Pros: room was cute. I had a decent view. They gave me a medical refrigerator. A lot of pool space. Bus stop right in front of resort. Cons: all those listed before. Southern end of the strip. Customer service extremely lacking. Noisy.
50,i needed a refrigerator for medicine and they had one to us within minutes. our safe would not open and they were there to fix it within minutes. i left my medicine on the fridge when leaving. we called and they had an answer to us calling back to us. within short period of time
40,Park MGM is a nice hotel and casino with a great location. The staff are friendly and helpful. It offers several restaurants. I like Park MGM because it is the only MGM property that is smoke free. I recommend Park MGM to everyone!
40,Had a great time concerts are great. There is alot of walking. Bring your sneakers. Make sure you plan your day. Most cabs are flat rates of $25. Plan ahead pay for shows ahead of time. Buy your snacks from Walgreens or CVS.
40,Casino is nice and clean room are nice just a little dated. Quite a few food options. Staff was friendly and casino is close to shopping and close to football stadium and hockey arena. Family was happy with the stay
10,Bloody comforter.  Never changed after a complaint.  Sink that flooded my bathroom because of a leaky faucet.  Really dated crappy room. Facility was not good. I mean really? For an mgm property this was pathetic. The Decore was the same as the Monte Carlo in 2003
30,Stayed at Park MGM for a wedding. Rooms were outdated and the waitstaff at Park were rude during the reception. Check in and check out did go smoothly and I liked that the pool was for guests only. Would not stay there again.
50,The Park MGM is now my go to spot when traveling to Vegas. I chose this hotel for the convenience when I came here to see Silk Sonic and Usher in concert and had a fantastic time. The gaming was great and the hotel staff was courteous and professional.
40,Helpful & friendly staff. Great choice of slot machines. Didn't spend much time in our room- who does in Vegas but comfy bed and perfectly good shower. Missed having a coffee machine in the room. Had a problem with the TV but this was rectified straight away and a beverage voucher issued for our inconvenience. Pity it was our last night had to use only a fifth of it on coffee from Starbucks as we checked out early the following morning
40,Disappointed with the room. There is no dresser to store clothes only a small closet to hang a few items. Room was clean. Beds and pillows not very comfortable. The facility very nice and staff was very friendly.
50,We had a nightingale suite near the elevator. The MGM reward center customer staff are the best. The Eatally place is awesome. This hotel is non smoking. It is so nice to play and breath clear air. We all will be back. This is memorable on my birthday.
10,On business and was looking forward to 2 nights of good sleep but denied by very uncomfortable beds that felt like anlphant sat on it before my arrival. I paid for a nice bed but got nothing for my money. I picked it cos it was smoke free. There's many options on the strip. I don't see coming back. Too bad cos I'm setting up my company here and this could be a good home away from home. You just lost a customer. But what do you care right? David  Go check room 121 / 6th Floor. You call me and tell me if you would sleep in it. I expected a lot more from MGM brand. It's horrible if you can't provide even a good night sleep. That's what hotel business is about. Beds. I guess yours is the Casino . Good luck
50,I absolutely loved this hotel. The staff was amazing. every staff member greeted us and said Hi with a smile. We had a very difficult time getting to Vegas we walked into Park MGM and there was a line to check-in. We got to the reception in 5 minutes it was so quick. The check-in was fast and the staff was so nice and friendly right away I forgot about the horrible plane ride and felt happy to be at the Park MGM. I am not exaggerating every staff member I had interaction with was friendly helpful and genuinely nice. I will gladly come back to this hotel any time loved it!!!!!!
10,Better off at golden nugget lol they treat you better and value your money. Im disappointed with this place and been here 5 months ago and figured why not try again and shame on me. Lesson learned for me I guess.
40,Rooms were clean and nice but not as nice as other MGM properties such as Bellagio. Carpet in hallways were either stained or just a a bad design. The casino was great and we liked that the restaurants were close. The layout of casino and shops is smaller than other locations but view this as a positive.
50,Had a great visit at the Park MGM. The resort is beautiful. Not as crowded as other hotels. The casino was big enough to enjoy all our favorite slot machines without a wait. The pools were nice and not too crowded. The room was nice and comfortable.
50,During our visit to Las Vegas earlier this month my wife and I with our two daughters sat in Eataly and enjoyed a meal and a few drinks. As we were walking through the shops I noticed a Security Staff Member whose name is Brewster standing nearby and as I do sometimes I thanked him for being there.    Brewster was very kind appreciated my gratitude gave my family some ideas for a meal and a drink and recommended some of the pastry’s as a dessert.    I wanted to tell Guest Relations / Services at Park MGM that they have an absolutely terrific Staff Member in Brewster. Thank You for hiring such a person next time I’m in Vegas my family and I will be staying at Park MGM.
50,Everyone from the girls who checked us in to the bus boys who cleared our tables after meals were so friendly and accommodating. The girls who cleaned the rooms were also very sweet. And we especially loved how nice the hotel smelled because there was a no smoking rule. And the Italian vibe was the best!!
50,We checked in just fine but were given a handicapped accessible room overlooking the pool. Since I have a family member who uses a wheel chair I thought it would be appropriate to inform the front desk (Lexi) that if needed I would switch rooms if another guest needed an accessible room. She was quite apologetic but I assured her that there was no need to be. She gracioulsy credited my MGM account $75.00. What who does that ? MGM does becuause the understand customer service. SIde note as a veteran I get free parking! Who does that MGM does because they understand the value veterans provide. On my second day I had a spa appointment and of course I got the day wrong it was for the following day my 3rd however the spa attendant informed me that they had a 11am openting for this day if I wanted. Well of course I did. The SPA is amazingly clean neat and exactly what travelers need to relax. Upon finishing the sauna and steam room I made my way over to the sa waiting area where I was greeted by Kim. In typical fashion she introdcued her self and we walked back to the room. She asked what I was looking for in specific areas of attention I provided her with a summary of my expectations areas I would prefer she pay more attention to and areas she could stay away from due to previous injuries. As a serious client to massage therapy to mediate various conditions I am well aware of the difference between a person who has studied practiced and is well versed in massage technique compared to a less experienced massuse. Kim provided what I think is the best spa experince one could ask for. She was attentive communicated her goals for me and provided a overall view of the Park MGM spa and other properties unde the MGM umbrella Who does that? A MGM employee who appreciates what the corporate structure has provided her with and its shows that the MGM family cares about the employee environment and the working conditions. Kim even recommended a facial hydrating mask that was perfect for the wery traveler such as my self. Over all the experience was just that an experience that was very pleasant very resonably priced and I will certainly be returning to the park MGM property on my next trip later this year.
40,The location was good for quick restaurant dining and lower cost shopping. The hotel itself offers many eating areas but none that interest us in comparison to what was available outside the property.
50,No smoking environment was awesome ! No watery eyes or the smell of smoke on my clothes. Rooms were clean and nicely appointed. Shout out to the bathroom design as it was very nice. In particular showers were large shower head placed high ( great for tall people ) and pressure was strong.
50,My stay was very quick as it was a surprise for my hubby's birthday and I had tickets to the Usher concert. I can't stand cigarette smoke and this hotel does not allow that. The staff from check in to check out was amazing. The rooms were clean and doesn't hurt that the food was amazing in the casino/hotel.
30,So was looking forward ro trying out an MGM. The pre info was good and liked the idea of the MGM app to download as use as a room key and book services. However no matter how hard i tried i just couldnt complete the sign up as my location was invalid. Got to hotel. Friendly reception. Room very plain and no fridge or even coffee maker. NO INTERNET throughout my stay. Had to scan everything likes menus but with no connection could not get any info. Ordered a printed room service menu day one. Never arrived. Tried to call room service via room phone. Didnt work. Has to queue evey time for the elevators. Starbucks in lobby had a 30 minute wait. Main buffer restaurant 30 minute wait. Although staff were friendly was just let down by the overall property and lack of services. Would not go back
50,Our family trip was great and this hotel is the perfect place to stay due to its has courteous and attentive staff clean guest room comfortable bed and clean bathroom shower with a very good water pressure it is like having a Hydro massage while taking a shower. It is also very close to everything like aria bellagio mgm grand. The tram from park mgm to Bellagio and Crystal shopping area of s very convenient and I consider a plus.
50,Park mgm…clean …friendly…professional..great place to stay…not one bad experience ..great place to gamble..floor staff and player’s club are the best…out of all casinos on the strip we recommend staying there..
20,I write this review as I sit in my hotel room wasting time waiting for literally anyone to bring me clean towels. Housekeeping never came yesterday. Today I called almost 5 hrs ago asking for towels and for someone to take our garbage and used towels. I called again 20 minutes ago...Nothing. None of the Housekeeping staff speak English when I asked for help from the staff in the hallway. It was pointless. This is beyond frustrating and disappointing to spend my trip waiting around for a simple request. I won't be staying here again.
50,There's so much to enjoy in this smoke free hotel/casino. The rooms are comfortable with plenty of lighting (a must for me) dog friendly and easy to take a cab or taxi around Las Vegas. Love love love eating at Eataly--a group of restaurants in the Park MGM that are Italian themed.
50,Every staff member we came in contact with were amazing. Hotel is older but very clean and smelled great. Rooms are on the small side but that is not a bug deal. Would be nice if they had fridges in the room
50,Location of property is great especially if going to venue at T-Mobile arena. Trams provide easy access and are available in both directions on the Strip. Italian Food Court has a nice variety of tasty food. Nice to be in a non-smoking hotel.
50,In Vegas for a wrestling tournament. Quiet room and good accommodations. Good food. Good bell hop. Good front desk personnel. Quiet room was great and allowed my son to get great rest and win his wrestling bracket!
10,I’ve had Already left the same review and I will say it again customer service was great at the front Mr. Derrick checked me in greeted me with a smile accommodated me with my keys my room was dirty up on arrival 105 on the 15th floor! Hair in the shower in the sink she’s not clean the next day just re-dressed the bed with the same sheets lashes in the bed right now how I know because they were my lashes from the night before not very good when it comes to cleaning the room not a great feeling due to Covid coming in and out that room he would think they were clean and strip the bed
50,Park MGM is in a great location for sports--Golden Knights play next door. Close to other MGM resorts. Great rewards program. Friendly staff. Eataly is a wonderful stop for dining--lots of variety. Easy access to taxi services.
50,Our stay was excellent ! Staff were uber friendly and helpful. No smoke  woohoooo !! I brought my Frenchie and she was welcomed everywhere. Great location  easy walk to everything. Definitely coming back !!!
40,Very nice decor and fancy restaurants. You should definitely try the steakhouse. The ambience is worth the reservation alone but the service was by far the best. Truffle Mac and cheese was perfect and the cocktails were amazing
10,nothing was like the pictures on the website. the room was very small. there was a sliding door for the bathroom & closet. the drawers were tiny as was the room safe. what we thought was going to be an art gallery turned out to be arty pictures in the rooms & around the property. there was only one restaurant to have proper meals in & it was unavailable one morning due to a private event. also we had reserved a cabana. neither the cabana or pool areas looked at all like the website. we were extremely disappointed & cancelled. we booked lounge chairs for the next day but changed our minds after we had a call from the pool employee who asked us if we were still coming because they had someone who wanted it & that the charge would be refunded. it wasn’t. another reason to be disappointed. the only good thing about our stay was the staff. they were all extremely pleasant & helpful.
40,Staff were all exceptionally helpful and friendly. Location was perfect. Loved that it was a smaller Casino so I never got list or turned around. Rooms needed a little updating. Great Restaurants. My favorite was La La Noidle. Food was excellent!
10,Smelled old and musty and very smokey. The furniture in the room was old and dirty outlets din't work. Sub par at best. They couldn't find our reservation or the people we were with. It took over an hour to check in.
50,This hotel is a delightfully friendly helpful clean quiet smoke free place to stay. Beds are comfortable and service is excellent! Don’t have to wait long for anything especially the elevator! Only reservation was that Starbucks closes way too early! Thursday night got there and wanted a tea at 7:15 pm but they closed at 7pm!
50,The wife and I made a quick trip visit some friends who went to Vegas for a conference. We picked Park MGM due to the location and couldn’t be happier with our choice. It’s a great hotel friendly staff and in a perfect spot.
20,make sure you take a electric warmer plate as there is no tea or coffee provision without paying $$. I found the place very average. I will research more in future as to where I want to stay in Las Vegas as this experience was average or below
50,This was my first time staying at this resort since it had been remodeled from the old Monte Carlo to Park MGM. The rooms were spacious and fantastic. The staff was super friendly and inviting. I couldn't be happier choosing this property especially because our last trip to Vegas in August we stayed at New York New York and it was well below MGM standards. Thank you Park MGM for restoring our faith in MGM properties.
40,The rooms were fine. Nothing to brag about. In the photos there were shampoo no conditioner dispenser in shower…in reality we had to go hunt down a maid to get little bottles. They just need a bit of a refresh I feel. Maybe others have been redone. (Although we supposedly got an “upgrade”. The small size was nice. Hallways were not incredibly long. Elevators generally were not over busy. No smoking was nice. Location always good. Overall it was a decent stay. Not as nice as Aria but better than the rooms at MGM (before remodel).
40,Rooms are clean bed was comfortable only thing lacking is a mini fridge. Location is great and the Starbucks in the lobby area was stupendous especially when your girlfriend is a coffee addict overall a great experience.
50,Stayed 4 days in a Nighthawk suite and saw the sunrise fab experience. Large room with modern bathroom and a comfy bed. Visited Primrose and Lala noodle and both were excellent. Free fizz for my special birthday and great staff including Jon floor manager and Letitcia housekeeping. Hotel is smoke free which suited us. Queues for coffee in mornings were huge and more coffee outlets would be appreciated but this was a minor issue. (Got ours from NYNY next door).
50,We booked this hotel mainly because we were going to see Usher at the Dolby. The front desk was friendly and the atmosphere was welcoming. Hotel is very clean. Love the modern but chic contemporary feel. Bavettes steak house was really good  best steak ever. Was a little on The dark side couldn't read the menu but the food was awesome. Room was clean  only problem was the mattress needed to changed out. Great spot on the strip!
10,Located in a great spot but that's about the only good thing at the Park. Room was dirty multiple things not working and hotel staff came into clean while the Do Not Disturb sign was on.    Ended up switching hotels for the second night - better places to stay especially at the price.
50,Our weekend was SPECTACULAR!! Starting with the comfort of our rooms at The Park MGM along with an awesome concert experience with the One & Only USHER!!! Sooo well worth the travel. We will book again!
50,The over all stay wasn’t bad . I felt the minimums where a bit high but it is what it is nothing we could do about that . Food was great and everything is pretty close . Games in the casino are fun but rates could be a bit lower .
10,We were in Vegas for one night for a wedding. Decided to stay here because it was close to the venue. The hotel itself had a musty sewer like smell. Our room was dated dingy and poorly cleaned. The shower had absolutely no water pressure. Just really disappointed overall especially given the price was about $500 for one night. Would never stay here again.
50,This hotel is right by Tmobile arena and the hockey team has pep rallies that last for hours before games that are really loud and it's impossible to get any sleep. It was only one day and didn't ruin my experience with the hotel or my stay in Vegas. I was there to see Usher on his birthday and I came and conquered.  This hotel is a non-smoking casino so it's nice not smelling smoke as soon as you walk into the hotel lobby or walking through the casino. I didn't get a headache and wasn't nauseous.
40,This was my first stay since it became the Park MGM. I enjoyed the improvements it had compared to when it was the Monte Carlo.  Only *sorta* complaint/realization was my room (which was a strip view) did not have a microwave or mini fridge. Every hotel I’ve stayed at has had both so it was strange to have not seen one in my room. It would be a shame it you would have to get an “upgraded” room for those amenities.  Regardless I enjoyed my stay!
50,Awesome place to stay and gamble if you are not looking for the high end luxury experience.    Both hotel and casino is non-smoking which is great because you do not smell like an ashtray by the time you get back to the room.    Great food options for every budget and centrally located on the strip.
40,The hotel is very nice and located in a great spot. The check in experience was longer than it should have been and the cell service is horrible for Verizon & AT&T. The tv in the room also kept idling and the list of channels could be better.
40,What a refreshing change to be in a smoke-free hotel/casino right on the Las Vegas strip! The location of Park MGM is near perfect especially with the sky bridge over LV blvd right outside the front door. Guest room was adequate (other than no refrig or coffee maker as is the std these days). Common areas were clean and well maintained. Eataly was fun wonderful pastries & desserts.
50,Everything was exceptional from the rooms food staff onsite amenities location parking and casino. Felt very safe part of the strip area with a lot to do in walking distance. Exceptional close to T-Mobile arena as well.
20,This hotel is the old Montecarlo with a fresh coat of paint high end resort charm cool pool and the same old dust. Close but no cigar! The location is great especially if you are seeing a show. It is just old smells of plumbing issues and the carpets are dirty/stained. If this place were truly renovated it would be a good place to stay for the price point. I’ve stayed twice and won’t be back any time soon.
50,The MGM Park is a great place to stay. The Casino is smoke free the staff is very friendly and the check in process is superb. Not the best bang for your book when it comes to room quality and size. However the housekeeping staff kept the room clean. I would definitely consider returning to the Park MGM
50,I’ve stayed at quite a few MGM properties and this in now one of my top two. I absolutely love that it’s non-smoking that’s huge to me! I loved gambling and eating and not coming home smelling of smoke or coughing. The ambulance of the hotel and Eataly was fantastic
50,One of the best hotels on the strip and is located near T Mobile arena for extra entertainment. The Dolby live theater is located in the hotel and is convenient for concerts and other entertainment. You won’t be disappointed.
50,I came back for the Usher concert. I stayed here in March 2022 for the Silk Sonic concert. I love that the concerts are in the hotel as well as anything you might need. The beds are super comfortable and the water pressure in the showers are very relaxing.
40,We have been traveling to Vegas for over 10 years and have always stayed at the Park.(Monte Carlo before it was rebranded) Room was clean and they are small. Shower was amazing as usual. The last trip in February we split and stayed at the Cosmopolitan and this trip we did the same. Staff at the Cosmopolitan are always friendly and helpful not so much at the Park. Limited dining options on the property so we always end up eating and gambling at NYNY.  You can’t compare the Park and the Cosmopolitan.
50,I've spent a lot of time at this Resort & Casino. The location is ideal the food and gambling options are great and it's an easy access point to meet friends. The room that I got was basic but no complaints. I love that the mirror is the most selfie friendly of any room I've seen. I've stayed at the NoMad before which has a very fun aesthetic and comfort and has a wonderful private pool on weekends.Most of my experiences are during Covid so the fact that they are stellar should mean more during normal operations. Please try Eataly! Such a fun experience there and the food will give you that Vegas energy that you crave. Have fun! It's also smoke free : )    ~Maddison
50,Great stay as usual. Rooms are very clean and well maintained. Love the no smoking atmosphere. Casino is the perfect size and the food is great! This is our favorite hotel on the strip.  LA LA Noodle Restaurant is a must during your visit. Great good and prompt staff.
40,First time staying here and everything was awesome!! Good food especially from Lala Noodle and the staff were all especially nice whenever I came into contact with one of them. The beds are definitely on the firmer side from what I had and it was a very simple room. No fridge not many drawers etc. They did have the normal safe bathroom amenities and all. I would definitely recommend this for those that don’t like super lavish rooms and a smoke free environment.
20,We had fetus on clean towels and the room was dark In dirty carpet. If you looking to go to show at the Park stay at there boutique hotel NoMad it next door very nice and clean.Sport bar television bad.
40,Rooms were extremely clean and staff was helpful since it was our first time here. The Park MGM is located in the center of it all. It's walking distance from great attractions. A bit noisy from all the activity on the strip. Can't wait to get back
50,My wife and I visited for our 1 year wedding anniversary and had a very pleasant time staying at this property. It’s located pretty central on the Vegas strip with easy to access a tram that runs between Park MGM-Aria-Bellagio that made it easy to walk to the casinos we have reservations at. The staff were friendly and accommodating and our room was very clean and comfortable.
50,It is my goto hotel every time I visit. It’s very accesible and everything is on hand. Clean and every detail is well taken care of. Beds are comfy as well. It has a wide range of restaurants! All of them offer delicious food.
50,Our stay was great the ease of checking in/out with the app was awesome. The hotel was clean and comfortable. Conveniently located to Dolby live and to public transportation to get around the strip and the old strip.
50,What a breath of fresh air. Literally. Loved loved loved that this is a non-smoking property. Great location and not super expensive. We will definitely stay here again. We don't need the frills of glamorous lobbies and such at other hotels on the strip.
40,Clean room with comfortable beds accommodating staff nice pool good location on the Strip reasonable price for a long weekend stay. No surprises no complaints no issues. An enjoyable stay for a vacation.
40,Highly recommend Park MGM especially since it is smoke free. We walked to other casinos but couldn't take the smoke so we did our gambling at Park MGM. The pools were nice and clean. Our room could use some serious vacuum cleaning tho. You could see the dust on the floor and there were toenail clippings in the carpeting. Other than that the rooms were dated but clean. We ate at PrimRose and Bavettes and had amazing food. My boys (mid-20's enjoyed Eataly). Food priced a little higher than outside places but it was good and met our needs. Staff were always smiling and very helpful. The casino area is well kept and clean. Other than the carpeting issue everything else was spot on. Would highly recommend. Niced to be a little away than mid strip.  Still busy foot traffic but not crazy like mid-strip. Keep up the great work Park MGM and love that you are smoke free.
40,The facility is very nice. Having a smoke-free resort is wonderful. The staff is friendly. Having Eataly attached is second to none. Great options for any meal. Pools staff is amazing. However the slots here are super tight! Minimal poker machines. It was so tight at Park MGM that we went to MGM and Planet Hollywood to play.
30,The room was decent and clean with a fun retro theme. Bedsheets were a little papery and scratchy but the mattress and pillows were good. We got good service from the staff. Pool and outdoor bar were beautiful and fun. Annoying to not have coffee pot or refrigerator in the room unless you pay a daily fee…? Room area of the hotel was quiet and private.
40,We stayed here for 3 days. Room was dated and could use updating but it was extremely clean. If it is trying to be retro and vintage with the guest rooms it is doing a great job. There are only 2 issues I had was 1. I wish the bathroom counter space was larger and 2. There was no fan in the bathroom. LOVED that the casino and hotel is smoke free
20,Everything was already written so not sure why we are being asked anything again but we had an awful experience and were made feel like we were not guests in the restaurant and we are seriously considering contacting at attorney
50,Our room was located next to the employees breakroom/maintenance room. We never got a good night sleep. Other than that our room was very nice with a view of the strip. Had fun in the casino. Enjoyed the food in their restaurants. All the food was delicious. And the staff very nice.
30,The room was clean but was poorly furnished. Closet space was very small because narrow dresser is in the closet. No desk no credenza no coffee maker. My room was noisy and had a horrible view of a rooftop with HVAC equipment. Obviously not all rooms ha is view but as an MGM rewards member I expected better
50,I would like to start with saying that the Park MGMs staff is very accommodating the atmosphere. Overall of this hotel is outstanding the fact that it’s a non-smoking casino is a plus the Eataly location is to die for overall one of the best hotels that I’ve stayed at on the strip
50,I  The overall value was one of the best on the strip. Good price balance between quality accommodations and central location. The only negatives are more Vegas general in nature. Things used to be 24/7 in Vegas and now restaurants etc. open late morning and close too early. I could not find good food past 11:00 pm.
10,Our neighbours opened they’re curtains during the night using a mechanical chain. The sound of it was so clear that i thought someone was in our room. No soundproof at all. Casino and staff are good but hotel isn’t up to par.
50,The non-smoking is why we stay. We have been staying for air quality and comfortable beds. From the Valet to Bell service baggage pickup the first day and pickup in the morning the last day. I take my aunt with me as we have each other and no other family members on the west coast. Checking in from the front desk and house cleaning has been fantastic. From my VIP Associates to MLIFE desk VIP Casino hosts have been wonderful.
10,The hotel is extremely old and in desperate need of a renovation. The photos online are very deceiving and they should be sued for false advertisement. Online the rooms have green and white decor but my room was all red (terrible color for a room someone sleeps in) and the decor looked like it hadn’t been changed since 1977. Outside of being old it was filthy and I am praying I didn’t get bed bugs. I will NEVER stay at this hotel again.
50,Staff is very friendly and helpful. Great location that is close to a variety entertainment and restaurants. We also really appreciate that the Park MGM is smoke free!  This is one of our favorite hotels in Las Vegas.
50,I must say that park mgm Las Vegas properties. I love the no smoking atmosphere as well as how friendly the staff is. There is no shortage of good food selections or places to grab a drink. It is also conveniently located close to center strip and hotel such as New York New York and the cosmopolitan making it easy to get to where you want to go and have a good time and make it back to your room safely. I would recommend staying at Park MGM for every Las Vegas trip. You won't be disappointed.
50,The Park MGM is an excellent place to stay! This has been my go-to hotel for many years due to the wonderful staff nice rooms and great location on the strip as well as the new stadium. Love the digital room key that was very convenient. Would recommend to anyone!
30,My husband and I love Vegas and have stayed at about 5 other hotels on the strip (including other MGM hotels). Park MGM is probably my husband and I’s favorite casino to gamble at due to its smoke-free nature as well as it contains several great restaurants that we enjoyed (Bavette’s Primrose Eatery and Lala Noodle). However much to our disappointment the rooms were very underwhelming and looked very similar to the former Monte Carlo just slapped with new paint. We also noticed that the room felt very humid and outside the room smelled like sewage. If we ever decide to stay again we hope to have a better experience.
50,Love staying at the park it has it all from food to gambling. Great staff! Super clean! Excellent location we left our car in the garage and walked pretty much everywhere you must visit Etaly! Great variety of food and great wines!
20,Our room was not ready for two hours after our check in time with no ETA.  The desk clerk ran my credit card twice because the chip reader didn’t work correctly.  When I asked for a manager’s number while at the front desk they gave me the number to the front desk.  The MGM app said I was checked in but the front desk said I was not in the system (though they agreed that the app showed that I was checked in)—and that was why I hadn’t received notice about the room not being ready Then they switched and said it was because my card needed to be ran.  I found my floor (25thfl.) smelled terrible. After visiting other hotels I felt ashamed bringing my partner back to rest in this hotel after long days.  There was dust all over the wall vent in the room and crumbs on the floor as if it was not cleaned thoroughly.  In the casino we had to move away from our machines because a woman started smoking. I specifically picked this hotel because she has a strong reaction to smoke and we could only spend minimal time in the other casinos. There was a table worker who saw and quickly asked the person to put the cigarette out but I felt like there wasn’t enough signage around to prevent someone from unwittingly making that mistake.  I was nervous about using the MGM app to check out but had no time to wait on the line. It seemed simple but it took until now 2pm the following day to receive the folio.    We were very happy with the concierge named Alejandra who booked our Grand Canyon tour and while we waited for the room.    The hotel’s food drink and other other entertainment amenities were great but I would only suggest someone come to visit those things and not stay at the hotel.  Eataly was pretty disappointing as far as it’s catering to the food needs of guests. What can I do with fresh made past? Put it in the room fridge I don’t have? Seemed underwhelming.    We didn’t even bother going to the pool because we had no real confidence in the cleanliness judging from our room experience.  I did appreciate having a full iron and ironing board available and although bar soaps are antiquated in hotels now—they smelled nice.    I was going to complain and my partner thought it was only right that I should be refunded the late checkout fee since we had no late checkin refund but my decision is just that I won’t stay here again and won’t recommend it to anyone—ever.
50,We recently stayed at the MGM Park to celebrate my son’s 21st birthday. It was a wonderful experience as usual. We love the non smoking casino and the friendly (patient) casino dealers. It’s definitely the place to stay while visiting sin city
50,Great room everything was fairly new and very clean. The strip view was more of the roof though it counted as a strip view since we could see the signs on the strip. We were disappointed there was no fridge but the beds were very comfortable the bathroom clean water pressure good. Love the full length mirror and long sofa.
40,A little expensive but really nice stay! Great customer service. Valet bell desk check in room service; they were all amazing! Big beautiful room and really good food. Pet friendly place with a nice potty area as well.
50,Great pools. I loved the non-smoking casino. The rooms were very nice and clean. We had breakfast at Primrose a couple of times and it was very good. The staff is very friendly and attentive. We stayed four nights and thoroughly enjoyed our stay.
50,Good location and easy check-in and check-out process. I love that it’s a no smoking establishment. Great location. My stay was three days and I had no issues. Good restaurants and Starbucks was busy but wait time was minimal.
50,Love staying at Park MGM. The location to the strip is nice but it's a little quieter than the others. Super clean because the entire hotel is non smoking. Very friendly and nice staff. Stay here every time I go to VEgas.
50,I really love that the Park MGM is a smoke-free casino. The location is excellent the rooms are nice and I feel there is good value compared to other hotel/ casinos on the Strip. The staff is friendly and the overall atmosphere of the place is great. They also have a good selection of restaurants on the premises. Eatily is one of our favorites.
50,Spent 5 days at the Park MGM with my wife and it was great! She loved the spa and massage. The food at Lala noodle company is by far our favorite. It’s a very convenient location if you have an event at T-Mobile.
20,The common area and casino are beautiful. It smells terrific and looks amazing. The rooms have low profile beds. The mattresses are lumpy at best. MGM usually has the very best pillows and mattress-not here. Hated the barn door closet-restroom door. It’s one in the same. If you want privacy in the restroom slide the closet door. The “art” on the wall is undesirable and a couple of pieces look as if a toddler did them.    Checked in and out from the app. Printed my room key by myself and had no interaction with staff. Not even a single waitress on the casino
40,Very large hotel lots and lots of people everywhere. The entire building smelled nice not stale or icky. The room was very clean and a nice size. The only negative I have is pricing - but then it is Vegas. We got a deal on the room so that was helpful but the in-room water/snacks were ridiculously priced - $18 for a small bottle of Fiji water?! All that said I would probably stay here again if the pricing was right.
50,This is our new go to place to stay when we're travelling with our kids in Vegas. The central location is great. Eataly and Best Friend are amazing. My kids are very sensitive to odors so being smoke free even when just walking through makes a big difference. Also the Nightingale suites are perfect for a family of 4 2 queen beds a fold out couch and a nice seating area for entertaining. We go to Vegas quite a bit and have stayed at most hotels and casinos. This place has us continually coming back. Also don't forget it's right next door to the T-mobile arena so convenient for a show!
40,This is in an awesome spot on the Strip with fairly easy access to both the Monorail and the Aria-Bellagio tram. The room was very clean and the bed was really comfortable. I did notice though that the bathroom sink and shower may have been clogged as those did not drain very well and the WiFi was very spotty. Most resorts like this in general tend to not have the best WiFi service by any means but I noticed Park MGM had perhaps the worst WiFi I’ve had while staying anywhere. I hope that’s fixed soon. I still recommend Park MGM for its location and proximity to everything you need during your stay in Vegas but it needed just a couple improvements.
50,The Park MGM is the only place I stay when visiting Las Vegas. The entire staff is very friendly and go above and beyond to make you feel welcomed. Also for me you can not beat that it is smoke free!
40,My husband and I come to LV 2 to 3 times a year and have stayed at almost all of the hotels....but not the Park MGM. We LOVED it! Check in process through the app was a breeze. Didn't even have to talk to anyone. Got notified our room was ready (early too and no extra charge was a plus) got a digital key and we were all set! All the staff we encountered were very nice the hotel and casino are very clean. Called to get our bags from the bell desk and they arrived in less than 5 min and were super nice!. The hotel and casino have an easy layout. The pool area was very chill. Really enjoyed the no smoking. Would be nice to have a fridge in the room but other than that no complaints. Will for sure stay here again.
40,Our room wasn't ready until 5 pm. There are 3 different elevators one each for lower middle and top floors. We checked in online early morning arrived/ stored bags at bell desk at 2. At 5 we came back and they assigned us a room. We opened the door and surprise! There are people in there! That was unsettling. I was left with the bags and my friend had to come back with security because they moved us to another tower and key card wouldn't let her back up to where I was (3 different elevators and you have to use room card to get it to move). Got to second room and only one bed we asked for two. Called downstairs. Asked and granted someone brought us new key cards for a trip to the third elevator but our key cards wouldn't work! Another trip downstairs with luggage. We finally got a nice room on floor 28 over the pool pretty sunset but this process took over an hour. Room 28-229 had a couch full length of window with black out shade. Two queen beds a small table with one chair. TV is wall mounted with a 4 inch wide shelf underneath which the snack tray was on (caution motion sensor so if you move it you buy it). The wall mounted table between the beds had ample plug ins and an odd round alarm/sound machine but no directions on how to use it. There is an odd sliding door that either covers the closet or the bathroom opening. There is an ice bucket but no coffee maker no fridge. Bathroom had one sink a toilet a walk in shower and a plastic 3 shelf stand. Two people cannot get ready at the same time in there but there is a tall mirror next to the tv with plug ins nearby. The next day: surprise! Our room key worked in the elevator but not the room!  The pool is quite nice but I admit I miss the lazy river of Monte Carlo days. Must show room key and have bags checked to go to pools. The South Pool is heated all year fully shaded all day. The North Pool gets sun this time of year about 11-2. The East pool didn't get much sun and we didn't go to the NOMAD pool. If you don't want to miss the pool or the football game you're in luck the North Pool has plenty of loungers facing the bar and tv screens. Drinks were good breakfast sandwich was good service was good. It wasn't a thumping music/social type pool but a nice relaxing area for all ages. They have a cooler with water bottles at each pool free.  This resort gets 4 stars from me because of the check in process the access card issues and the trash that was in the hall for 3 days. But the location center strip great shower water pressure the ease/location of ride-share the food at Eataly the tram to Bellagio nice room and pools easy walk to TMobile and Park restaurants might warrant a 5.  The parking structure is a short walk to bell desk check-in ride share and pools. You only have to go a few steps farther into casino to get to the elevators (some hotels you have to walk through entire casino to get to the pool or check in from parking or rooms - like Mandalay Bay) so this hotel would be good for someone who has walking limitations or for families with kids that you don't want loose in the casino.
30,Rooms over priced with nowhere to store your clothes. Don’t bother with Stay Well no benefits for added cost. Eataly is great so stay somewhere else but try Eataly. This was our 20th anniversary trip and thankfully the shows and other hotels had great experiences.
50,Good customer service! The bed was comfortable and the shower pressure was amazing! 🤩🚿 I really enjoyed the pool area and the conference rooms were nice. I would definitely stay there again!!! 😀👍🏻
50,Really enjoyed the stay the location and the knowledgeable staff! Hope to visit again and get to use the pool next time it’s hard being a local and everyone getting the same days off to enjoy everything that is offered my daughter did absolutely love eataly she studied Italian in high school and it was so exciting for her to shop around the products from the country she studied!! Thank you for bringing a taste of all over the world to us!! We have tried many restaurants over the years and loved the amazing service at all of them there is still always more to explore!!
50,Just recently stayed at the Park MGM and I was 100% satisfied! The rooms are clean and we had a nice view. The location was perfect! Layla Noodle was so yummy! Love that we didn’t have to go anywhere to get Starbucks!
30,Overall not bad. Good location. Pack liquid soap and lotion does not come with the stocked bathroom amenities. Staff and service in hotel very good. There was a gummy bear stuck to the ceiling that we could not stop looking at nobody wanted to sleep on the bed underneath it. It was disgusting.
50,Very friendly staff and clean. Check in and check out process was fast. Located in the middle of everything. The Dolby theater was great. Great experience overall. I like the fact that it is non-smoking
40,We enjoyed our stay for a concert. The Italian market was beautiful with amazing food. Wish there was a mini fridge for our leftovers. We never went to the pool. So unable to rate pool. Otherwise we had an amazing view and great experience.
10,Upon arrival the resort looked welcoming and pleasant. That all changed once we got to the floor of our room. The hallways were unsettlingly dark and the room was not cleaned well at all. The entire floor smelled of smoke and alcohol. This wouldn’t have been an issue and we may have returned to the property again after the fabulous meal we had at LaLa Noodle. However we had a friend come over to gamble from the MGM grand. She was at the craps table when another patron ran into her knee and pinned against the table with a motorized scooter. The hotel didn’t offer any resolution other than a wheelchair to push our friend back to their sister resort. We weren’t looking for money here but a complimentary trip to the ER and removal of the complete drunkard that struck our friend would’ve sufficed. Terrible customer service. Bulldoze this dump but leave the restaurants. Only bright spot.
50,The location was perfect. Went to TMobile to watch a hockey game. The fact that the resort is smoke free is what all the casinos should strive for. I would recommend this to anyone that wants a hassle free resort with the perfect location. Will be our primary stay from now on going to Veags
10,You literally hear everything from next door. I woke up to my neighbor talking on his phone and I could hear the whole conversation. Imagine what else you can hear. Take your family somewhere else.  I definitely won’t be back.
50,Close to T-Mobile arena (1 min walk). Self parking is close to guest elevators no long walks from car to room. Staff are friendly and courteous. Best Las Vegas stay in a long time. Had never stayed here before but Park MGM will be our new regular hotel.
20,Ripped carpet dirty bedding and very thick dust on nearly every surface and fixture. This was by far my most disappointing stay in Vegas. I imagine the updated rooms are quite nice but if you have the misfortune of getting an outdated room (despite booking directly with MGM) best be ready to add 20 years to your idea of outdated.
20,It was 5 stars until I had to checkout at 4am and no staff around to help. My wife and I had to transport over a dozen pieces with our 4 young children in tow. What made it worse was I tried to schedule assistance the day prior. Staff assured me not to worry for early mornings aren’t busy and just call ten minutes prior. Not how I wanted to end my stay with the added stress of being late to the airport!!
50,Loved that the rooms hotel casino is smoke free and Eataly was awesome! The staff is friendly and helpful. The Dolby Live was a great venue where we saw Aerosmith. I would stay here again just because it’s smoke free. Some things could be updated but overall it’s a great hotel.
50,Our stay was good. Service was good. The only thing that could of been better was the beds are to low to the ground!! Other than that it was a good trip. Food was good. The shops were a little pricy .
40,My first time visiting this property since the switch from Monte Carlo. I liked the updated look and elegant feel of the hotel. We had a fantastic time at the pool and seeing Aerosmith perform. Long lines at the bell desk were my only real complaint.
50,The Park is a very nice non smoking venue with excellent food and beverage options. The gaming experience is also very good with plenty of options for tables and slots. Overall really good experience.
50,This is our second stay in this hotel and I just like the maturity feel of the hotel. We loved Roy Choi's restaurant Best Friend and of course Eataly is delicious. After the Aerosmith concert we spent some relaxing time at Mama Rabbit listening to live music. Just awesome!
30,This hotel was not great. We walked around for 7 hours waiting for our room to be ready partly due to the text notification process not working correctly. There was no coffee maker or fridge in the room and our room was dirty. There was a heavy layer of dust on the headboard a large blood stain on the comforter and the shower dripped the whole time. The hallways are also very dark and the ceilings are low which makes you feel like you're in a very old cheap hotel. The staff were friendly the casino is smoke-free and the location is great if you're seeing a show or game at the Arena but those are the only positives of Park MGM. We won't be going back.
50,ParkMGM is a fantastic location for a weekend get a way to Las Vegas. Rooms are clean staff helpful and friendly. Something is always happening in the area so fun is only seconds away! ParkMGM casino allows fro chances to win each spin!
50,Had a wonderful experience here!  Convenient location good food selection clean rooms terrific view... the only thing I wished they had was a frig in the room... pools are beautiful... safe and non smoking are a definite plus!
50,A great time was had by all. From check in to check out the Park MGM Hotel and Casino provided all the amenities that one could ask for. It is lovely to walk up and down the strip checking things out but you could spend the entire time here without feeling you missed a thing.
40,Park MGM Las Vegas is totally non-smoking so that’s great. There are several good restaurants and Dolby Live Theater is right there for major concerts. Hotel is clean and the decor is quite nice. The king room we had was small but okay for just two of us. Pool area is well designed but the lounge furniture and umbrellas definitely show their age. The drinks from the poolside bars were delicious!
10,Terrible hotel with small dirty rooms. Over priced room service so bad they forgot our utensils napkins and tiny packages of salt and pepper. We had a jacket stolen WHILE we were checking in. Bell hop destroyed a suitcase!!! Had two rooms both needed service upon arrival! Worse hotel I’ve ever stayed at in Las Vegas
50,Wonderful hotel. Very clean. Pool area nice. The casino was non smoking which was great! We attended Aerosmith concert a Dolby Live. It was a lovely week. I would highly recommend this hotel. Convenient to all Vegas has to offer.
50,This trip was amazing. The staff are super friendly and they treated us like family the room was spotless the view was great. Overall it was a very memorable experience I definitely recommend Park MGM.
50,Love staying at the Park MGM. Staff are friendly and very helpful. Monorail to and from the Bellagio is handy! Pools are beautiful! Spa was wonderful! Great staff and loved the serenity! Will always choose the Park MGM!
50,Went to see Aerosmith at the Dolby Theater on 10/5/22. What a show! I was expecting them to be ok for their age but wow they sounded awesome. Steven Tyler can still wail the high notes and Joe Perry proved again why he is a guitar god. I'd go see this show 100 more times if I could.
50,The Park MGM is our go to hotel for concerts and shows .. conveniently located for Dolby Live and T Mobile .. the pools are amazing .. totally smoke free property .. direct access to room tower elevators from lobby
50,My second time I stayed this hotel and I love it.. Good pricing great stuff cleaned and nice rooms close to every single place I went on the strip my check in and check out very quick and proffesional
20,Poor service. Signed up for MGM resorts $50 food and beverage which was not applied. Room was marginal there weren't any robes no toiletries no refrigerator for personal use and no complimentary coffee. I was charged $10 for opening the refrigerator we never took anything out. And when I called Saturday 10.8.22) to discuss the bill with someone I was disconnected 8 times. Never again
50,Non smoking is the main reason. Nice casino pool very nice food choices are good and food was very good. location is great and staff were very nice. Rooms are clean. Would recommend staying here after checking out other resorts.
50,From the moment we arrived (late) on Monday until we checked out at 4:15 am Friday our stay was perfect. The staff member at the VIP check-in was efficient and got us to our room quickly. We had questions from time to time over the 5 days and they were always cordial. LOVE that it's smoke-free!
50,Though not as large as other MGM resorts the Park offers comfortable sophisticated accommodations great gaming and friendly staff. The location near the MGM trams and the great MLife rewards program elevate the stay!
50,This is the only non-smoking casino on the Las Vegas Strip. Rooms are very comfortable. Restaurants are all terrific. Every Park MGM staff member we encountered was helpful and friendly. The Dolby Theater is an amazing venue. We saw Aerosmith there and were blown away!
50,We travel to Vegas 2 or 3 times annually. The Park is one of our favorites on the Strip. Prices are good it's convenient to shows at Dolby Live & T-Mobile Arena and the hotel and casino are smoke-free!
50,Best hotel that I have stayed at in a long time. The rooms were very clean .. fresh looking and super comfortable. The maid service was extremely great and the room was kept immaculate when serviced. If your staying in Las Vegas this is the place to stay !!!!
50,The only non smoking hotel on the strip. Being able to avoid the smell of smoke and to avoid smelling like smoke was wonderful. Great location and The Eatily was excellet -- good food and ambiance. Clean nice room with a comfy bed. Very convenient self park next door.
50,Love it here! Staff so nice hotel is beautiful and clean. Location is perfect- I walk to all the other MGM casinos feeling very safe New York New York MGM Grand. Pool and food at the pool is great especially the Cobb Salad Eataly food is amazing!
40,Recently returned from a 4 night stay at Park MGM. Can't beat the location as well as the resort being smoke free. While not flashy the pool was very calming and water temp was just right.. Staff very friendly - will definitely stay here in 2023.
50,Great Hotel friendly staff and perfectly located in the heart of the strip. I’ll definitely be staying here on my next trip. Casino is also one of the better ones around the area. Dolby theatre in the hotel and T mobile directly across the street it’s the perfect place to stay if catching shows at either venues.
40,Our first vacation post Covid. Love the smoke free atmosphere of Park MGM and the central location. Had a friendly staff. Good selection of restaurant choices. Even came back home with a little bit of money.
40,We had a good time at the Park MGM. ITS A NON SMOKING resort. Casino nice and clean. Eataly is the best Italian food in town. Rooms very comfortable. Only issue is the Arena. If there’s an event i.e. Hockey game the place is a mad house. Can’t get into parking and roadways jammed.
50,Check-in on a Sunday afternoon at 4:00 pm was a breeze - lines short and moved quickly. Rooms are clean and well-maintained. Housekeeping staff is great. Casino staff is great. Just a fun environment to visit - we will be back!
50,Great location no smoking in the entire facility clean rooms and friendly staff. Add in the free tram to Bellagio and I can't think of a greater place to stay. Second time since converting to Park MGM from the Monte Carlo. Also stayed at Monte Carlo several times.
10,"Attention Fans who pay to be in the pit! Please be aware that even though you might of paid alot for a ticket paid to fly and stay in vegas and stood in line for hours to be close to the stage while in the pit you will most likely be told to step back from your hard earned and probably expensive spot because Park MGM will bring in a random amount of random women (who know from where but you can guess where...) to put up front by the stage. When i asked why this was happening a rude blond employee said and i quote ""they (park mgm) do it for publicity you'll see"" tehn she shrugged at others who where sharing my concern and anger then slipped away behind security guards who said she was some part of management but still wouldnt divulge her name so i could file a proper complaint. Then women who were allowed up front by this employee then proceeded to tell everyone that this was their ""spot their friend had given them and they had a right to be there"" then said women proceeded to get drunk spill drinks on the electrical equipment hold up signs blockiny people's view even though nothing was supposed to be allowed in (we were told we could not bring a vinyl record) then start fights with those who voiced the displeasure over their actions attitude and sign! To the point where i had to call security on one woman.    While Aerosmith did put on a great show that was the only good point of our visit. Most staff had no clue what they were doing or where anything was at place was poorly staffed with uneducated staff. First they let us in then move us out then back in then back out. No clue of timing or consistency. And then the rude employee who seeming put her friends or call girls upfront reguardless of the paying customers/fans then acting like a childish teenager by shrugging and slipping away behind security was the straw that broke the camel's back. After that the wife and I refused to spend anything at park mgm and went else where and will continue to go elsewhere. Id expect this kind of shady stuff from a hotel/motel but not from a lbig property like park mgm. Boy did they prove me wrong."
50,This trip was to celebrate my anniversary with my wife  It is our third time coming to this hotel and we love it  Seems to have everything in our check list and we are always happy with our stay here  Staff is great and rooms are clean
40,Arrived on our anniversary and had the most romantic dinner at an MGM restaurant thanks to the help of staff. We felt like we were living the dream. Every day was better than the last. Plus the casino wasn’t overcrowded even at peak hours. I always had a seat at a table when I wanted one. So much fun I can’t wait to come back!
50,This hotel is centrally located on the strip. It’s convenient to walk to multiple destinations. The staff is friendly and readily available to help. The accommodations are excellent clean facilities.
50,Great location. Pool is nice although in fall the sun is a bit limited. Love the eating options on site and close by. Room is small but perfect for visiting Vegas and having fun and sleeping. I would definitely stay her again.
50,Went to Vegas for the first time since Covid. Decided to go to Park MGM. Had been a big fan of the Monte Carlo that it replaced. Well the new joint did not disappoint. It was completely smoke-free which was so wonderful. The staff at all locations - front desk rewards desk pool bars dealers - were warm friendly helpful. The room (we stayed in a Stay Well room) was well-appointed the bed was comfortable. The shower was a work of art.    Ate at most of the restaurants in the place - had one great meal after another. The chocolate pie at Bavette's steakhouse should not be missed.    And if you want to branch out you can take the free tram from Park MGM to Bellagio. Or walk a handful of steps outside and check out a handful of other shops and casinos.
50,Our lil vacation at the park MGM was great. From checking in and checking out it was so very easy. You have the most beautiful staff. So friendly and so will to help. We will definitely be back. We have several choices to stay but we keep coming back to the Park. Thank you
40,Stayed there out of convenience to see the Aerosmith concert at the Dolby. Staff and security was very helpful in all matters. Good location to walk to other places on the strip. Planning on going back in December for their final show.
50,Love this hotel. It is a NON Smoking hotel and casino excellent food options and perfect location on the strip as the free tram will take you to the Bellagio (mid-strip) and is right across from Planet Hollywood. Must try Best Friends (Korean-Mexican fusion restaurant. Eataly is a great spot to grab a quick bite for early dinner or breakfast.  Bed was very comfortable bathroom was a good size and room was updated. Water pressure in shower was amazing - strong pressure and hot shower.
50,I highly recommend this property - very clean and the personnel were very helpful and friendly. The property is right next to the sports arena and there are all kinds of shops around it. Eatily is really cool!
50,My wife and I stayed at the Park MGM for the first time. The smoke free hotel and Casino was noticeable. We enjoyed the Eately where the food was fresh and delicious. The last night we walked next door and went to the hockey game.
30,On the plus side good location in the quieter part of the strip. Good size pool that isn't too crowded. Good size powerful shower. Rooms clean and bed comfortable.  On the minus side rooms are fairly small decor is not great - the ceiling lamp for example was attached to the wall with what looked like a makeshift cable. No coffee and tea making facilities - this was the only hotel on our US trip that didn't have a coffee maker. Overall nothing to shout about.
30,Something really disturbing happened the last day of my staying.  I was in the room at 1.00 am going to sleep my husband was already sleeping and I was reading my kindle when I heard the lock of the door opening and the light of the hallway coming into my room I screamed and the person shut the door but I couldn’t sleep and at 3.30 am again somebody knocked many times at my door and I cried who is it ? And somebody said housekeeping!!  I’m short next morning I went to the front desk and told them what had happened and that I didn’t sleep at all! The manager came they were all very concerned and all the charges I had were paid by them .  Anyway it was a very stressful situation.
50,The staff everywhere were great and very accommodating. We have stayed at the Park MGM for over 5 years now and the location is ideal. Also the hotel is not so large that you can get to the strip easily.
50,Love that the hotel casino and pool are all non smoking. The rooms are great with a nice window bench. There are multiple pools with great service. Starbucks in the lobby with lots of staff to keep the line moving. Great hotel customer service.
40,Let’s start with the positives. The staff was super friendly and helpful. The casino was awesome to me because it was a nonsmoking property. For people who want to bring their furry friend pets are welcome. The food choices were decent and I enjoyed the in room dining. What I didn’t like was the room and the hallways. The room just didn’t hit the mark for me. The bed was low to the floor and the door to close the bathroom also doubles and a closet. The idea was to make it like a barn door but it missed the mark. I did enjoy the shower. My biggest complaint is the hallways. It made me feel like it wasn’t safe. I can see people being turned off by the dark and ominous hallways. I think if management would just change the lighting it would go a long way.
50,The hotel was clean and comfortable and the best part was that it's a completely nonsmoking hotel. We went to check out all the hotels on the strip and had go go through the casinos in a lot of them. They all smelled like cigarettes. They also weren't really that crowded. When we got back to the Park MGM around 930p the casino was packed. That tells me more people prefer to gamble in a smoke free environment. I would have enjoyed my trip to Las Vegas more if we could have been exposed to less smoke
10,The hotel is massively understaffed for the number of guests. There were only 2 front desk agents and a massive line down the lobby. The Primrose restaurant was less than half-full yet we had a 20-30 minute wait. The rooms are musty dated and the color of moss. The furnishings are dreadful and dark and the carpeting is a nasty shade of brown. The bed was soft and too low to be comfortable. And worse of all the air conditioner shuts off when you sleep or leave the room so it is unbearably hot. We called engineering but they came up and refused to bypass the motion detector so we could sleep or be comfortable.
50,Park MGM is smoke-free uncrowded clean reasonable and in a great location. The tram is very convenient. Restaurants and bars are great and the pool area is clean and relaxing. Primrose is a favorite breakfast spot. The pancakes are a must.
50,This is a place for good clean fun with no smoke! Clean rooms nice pools. Basic sports book but very accommodating. Great food options. Pick here if you don’t need an all night party but lively atmosphere with no smoke and great food options. Pool has a 18 plus area that was perfect for those lazy morning. Drink staff was on point!
30,Not worth what I paid for. Once I got in the front desk person that checked me in did not give me information until I asked. He never told me what time check out was or other benefits of being a gold member.
40,The park mgm was very nice  felt safe and everyone was very friendly. I would stay and recommend to anyone. Just be prepared to use Uber or taxis frequently if you choose to leave the casino- hotel .  Everything is pretty close from rooms to casino and the strip. Good location
50,This is the only place we will be staying when we return to Vegas.  Eataly is great do many amazing places to eat there. Dolby Live is a great place for a concert. Hotel is right across the street from T-Mobile Arena. The entire staff is very friendly and helpful.
30,The lobby and casino are very nice. Restaurants are hit or miss. The room was a let down. Noisy neighbors thin walls- could hear all conversations and …activities.carpet not vacuumed well- food crumbs on the carpet. Fingerprints on the closet mirror. Clogged shower drain.
40,Based on some of the reviews I didn't know what to expect during our stay but overall it really wasn't that bad. Our room was clean and the air conditioner worked well. The rooms aren't anything fancy but still nice. A mini fridge would've been nice. The halls are dark and have a weird smell but not a deal breaker. The walls are VERY thin. We could hear everything in the room beside us. The pool area and service were great! Check in was an easy process. I would stay here again if I'm ever back in Vegas.
50,I stayed at the Park MGM to attend the Aerosmith concert for the 2022 Vegas Residency. I cannot say enough good things about the convenience of staying where the venue is held. It was as easy as riding the elevator down from my room walking through the casino lining up and going inside. Everything about this experience was magical! The check-in was also effectively done. The room felt dated not as clean as I would have anticipated and the air conditioning did not cool effectively. Common ammenities like a refrigerator cost extra which was surprising for a four-star hotel. The Primrose dining experience offered exceptional food and service but was pricey. I paid almost $100 for breakfast for two people. Eataly was an excellent bonus that offered great cuisine and culture. Lunch there was more in line with the prices I expected. Everything is more expensive in Vegas so be prepared for that reality. A small Fuji water was $28 from the mini bar in the room and the Aquafina was $10 but it cost if the Fuji was $2.49 at the Target across the street from the hotel. Overall I would stay again but my expectations would be more realistic. Park MGM offers so much that is good but it is a roll of the dice as to whether or not all your expectations will be met.
50,After a simple and quick mobile check-in experience to a clean spacy room (with great water pressure I might add!) I continued to encounter smiling and helpful faces throughout the rest of the Park MGM complex. The pit staff was incredible and the bag check service was underrated and top-rate. I can't wait to return!
50,Everything for a wonderful stay whether you gamble or simply want to enjoy the wine  food or sights. The pool is so inviting with prompt drink and food service as you relax on your pool chair or brace the bar chatting your favorite bar attendant.
20,The shower curtain in our room was covered in mold. It wasn't a small amount. It likely had been growing for weeks.    Room lacked basics like cups for water or a coffee maker.    A security guard also refused to press the elevator button for me when I was struggling with food/coffee in my hands.
50,Lovely hotel great location and rooms! Friendly staff! Clean resort! And good casino floor! Awesome restaurants best friend is amazing and a must go too! Can’t say enough smoke free resort which is nice but has designated smokers sections outside the hotel!
20,The music from the hockey games and events outside prevents you from enjoying your room amd the pool. Everytime the team scores an airport. Goes off. It was ridiculous and was told I needed to pay to upgrade where that wasn't an issue
40,This is the best hotel for T-Mobile Arena events and Raiders games. Definitely recommend if you are planning on attending these venues. Pretty nice pool area rooms and hallways were updated recently and clean.
30,Was an ok hotel no refrigerator or coffee machine in the rooms. The staff hardly interacted with us and when we had a complaint about our rooms they told us we would get our resort fee waved but that never happened.
50,Park mgm is an excellent place to unwind and relax after a hectic schedule at work..The restaurant staff goes above and beyond. They always give good and excellent service..I will definitely recommend it to my friends and family..
10,Staff are rude and non-caring. The bartenders could care less about serving customers and the wait staff just do enough to get through their shift. The food is way overpriced. The shows are overpriced. The hotel is more interested in signing people up for the rewards program than actually helping people. And I am still waiting for my access to their rewards program.
30,I don’t think I would stay here again. Called in the middle of the night to the front desk to let them know the AC wasn’t working and they decided to send someone early in the morning while I was asleep. It might have been 8 am. My husband told him to come back once we were dressed around 10 or 11 am. I’m not sure if he ever came back because we were gone for hours. Room felt a little cooler but same thing happened in the middle of the night. The AC wasn’t blowing cold and it was extremely warm in the room.
40,Enjoyed our 4 night at Park MGM and met family there in Las Vegas. The smoke free environment was a definite plus being a disabled military veteran. Also Park MGM’s location on the strip provides easy access to many other casinos and other amenities.
50,Highly recommend for the smoke free atmosphere comfortable rooms and great pools/restaurants. We also stayed as we had tickets to Aerosmith Deuces are Wild concert. What a blast- and so convenient since it’s right on site.
10,Attending the Aerosmith concert so decided to stay here for 3 nights in the Stay Well King room . Was checked into the wrong room and sick ever since . Thanks Mgm for ruining my 28th wedding anniversary. Management said they would put us in the reserved room but now wasted half day waiting for the key.
40,Great stay. Room was ready at 11am which was fantastic since we were coming from another hotel stay. Did entire check in on app. Wish we would have gotten a room on a higher floor but I didn’t request it. Room decor isn’t that great but room was standard and had comfortable beds. Housekeeping staff was very pleasant. EATALY was an absolute treat! The pools (3) are wonderful with very friendly bar service and plenty of loungers.
40,This casino offered a non-smoking very clean environment throughout the casino and rooms. Most casino personnel were friendly and helpful. Check-in computer was down so check-in wasn't smooth. Ramp access was a problem because my card did not work but this was finally handled by some casino personnel.
50,Just a quick weekend getaway for a friend's birthday. The pool was amazing and not over crowded even for a weekend. Room service was overpriced but that's to be expected. The food was very good and arrived still hot.
50,My belief is that if you have nothing good to say don’t say anything. But to be fair without throwing anyone under the bus you should do more supervision of rooms. Before putting someone in it. Our room smelled moldy and it was all over dusty. Was it been remodeled and that’s why it was so neglected? We’ll never know
40,Everything you need in one place. Very low key with a variety of clientele. Non-smoking is a huge plus. Cheapest casino table games were $15 minimum from what I saw. $8.99 ATM fee in the casino. Need a better Sportsbook if you’re going to be next to the arena. Thin walls lots of noise between rooms and hallway. Lots of noise from outdoor arena activities during an event. Not as much riffraff as other casinos.
50,The staff were friendly helpful and welcoming. The Park MGM location was in the middle of all the fun has great places to eat especially the gelato and the separate adult pools have fantastic music.
40,Overall nice place to stay. The staff was excellent. The room on the other hand had quite a bit of dust on every surface. The air conditioner took an extremely long time to cool the room. The dust was our main complaint. Looked like the room hadn't been used or cleaned in a while.
10,Would not recommend this room. One small round table not enough to share for 2 people. Room was dirty and weird red paint and red tile. Housekeeping never showed up until we had to call at 6pm asking for room cleaning. Staff not friendly. No proper noise insulation; you can hear everything next door and in the hallway.
50,This stay was won as part of the iheart radio promotion for the music festival... beautiful accommodations and great convince to the strip The Eatly food court was amazing also and all ofcthe decor was beautiful throughout the property.
50,Comfy bed with an awesome concert to top it off. I don’t like the round bar. They don’t smile much. We go to Venitian for that! Other staff willing to help. There needs to be more places to eat though. Primrose wa good but the only place for breakfast.
50,I am so thankful there is a non smoking hotel and casino option in Las Vegas. This is my biggest reason for staying at the hotel. I was also pleasantly surprised by the excellent restaurants - definitely recommend Primrose for a breakfast and/or brunch and Eately is great for something quick and won’t break the bank. The staff was also very friendly. Will definitely be staying at this hotel next time I visit Vegas.
50,This was my second time staying at Park MGM and won't be my last. The rooms are well taken care of and clean. The casino and other areas of the property are well maintained and extremely clean. Easy access to parking garage is a plus also.
40,Nicely renovated used to be the Monte Carlo. Rooms were a decent size had a nice view. Resort fee is a bit expensive not sure what the going rate is in Vegas these days though. Pools were nice option for 18+ pool without any children around. The tram that links to aria and Bellagio was also a huge plus to save some steps when walking everywhere.
50,This was our first time in Las Vegas but definitely won't be the last time here. This was a great reset for our marriage. The only bad thing is how much money was spent but that's our own fault. We had a blast thanks mgm.
50,Great rooms staff restaurants and fun Casino environment. There has to be a reason that a lot of staff members have worked at this Hotel for over 15years. That says something for the quality of management which trickles down to the excellent service provided. We have been guests at the Park since its early days when the Monte Carlo first opened. We tried other places early on but decided we love the now Park. Other than the theater performances it does not attract hoardes of Strip visitors to see liontigers and bears and fountains and sharks......Love the Casino and we don't a GPS to get back to our room. It is truly a chick boutique Hotel.
50,We had a very pleasant experience inside the property. The room was nice and clean. A safe is provided inside the room which is nice. A complimentary bottle of water would be nice though. Parking was convenient.
30,I recently stayed at the Park MGM Hotel. The staff was friendly. However my room could had been better. Especially the floor location and my room. Bathroom hand held for a shower head. I mostly likely will not be staying at this hotel my next visit to Las Vegas.
50,We stay at the Park MGM when we are in Vegas and it never disappoints. Easy check in super clean lobby and casino. Love that the whole facility is smoke free. Great places to eat! Super close to the other places in Vegas we love.
40,Expected a lot more for the price I paid. Vegas had a lot going on so I'm sure that is why our stay was so much. Homeless is a growing problem on the strip that was a sore sight. The casino itself is nice but PRICEY...
50,Overnight hit and run stay. Came in to see Aerosmith. Amazing venue.  Ate at My Best Friend. Love the Korean flavors and the cool vibe. Great service.  Well appointed room. Lots of space. Great mattress.
40,This is our 4th visit to Las Vegas first time at PMGM. Park MGM is well maintained and very clean in both the public areas and room (we stayed Rm 218 Floor 17) compared to similar facilities on the strip. The advantage with our stay is we could charge back any meals to our room at any MGM property (so MGM Grand New York New York Paris Luxor etc…our deal included a US$50 credit per day for meals). The bed and pillows were excellent as well as aircon system being quiet and effective (one of the best we’ve stayed at). The room decor was a little “eclectic” not sure if I liked it or not. But the public areas tasteful (for casino that is). The three pools were excellent although I’m not sure why they shut at 6pm? Very clean perfect temp and good vibe. One negative our room had an adjoining door and the soundproofing was hopeless however the other unseen guest was considerate thankfully otherwise we would have complained. Good location if your first visit to the strip with the big attractions like Caesars and Bellagio an easy walk or you can catch the tram by going thru MGM Grand.
50,Great stay at this hotel and I would definitely return. Check-in was quick and easy thank you Daniel parking is excellent. Loved all of the food and drink options to at Eataly.    An extra special thank you to Hank Graae from the Security department who was so helpful with directions and kindly answered questions amazing man! An asset to the MGM brand!
50,Went to the MGM twice unsuccessfully to visit the Haus of Gaga before finally catching it open. This is without doubt one of the best things to do for free in Las Vegas and a must see. The costumes are amazing and displayed beautifully. However that sets this hotel/casino above the rest is the ability to breath clean fresh air inside.  This hotel cares for the welfare of their staff and customers and the environment is a place you want to stay and play.  Definitely somewhere I would stay on our next trip to Vegas.
50,This is now our go to hotel when we visit Vegas. We have both MGM rewards and Caesars rewards. The MGM hotels and casinos seem to be better properties overall. The Park MGM is attractive to us because the the location and it's non-smoking.
50,Park MGM is my favorite hotel and casino on the Las Vegas Strip. It’s the only hotel and casino on the Las Vegas Strip that is smoke-free. The rooms are updated and very clean. There are numerous slots and table games and the servers are very attentive when you’re gambling.    There are numerous restaurants and dining options in the hotel as well as a concert venue (Dolby Live). This hotel and casino is one stop shopping you do not have to leave the hotel if you don’t want to. They have a very good gym and pool among many other great amenities; also the hotel is very affordable depending on the time of year. I cannot say enough good things about the Park MGM in my opinion it’s the best hotel on the Las Vegas Strip.
50,Service here is good from the reception luggage holding pool. I liked the hotel a lot and it deserves 5 star especially since it is non-smoking and middle of the strip close to everything. The rooms are nice too.  Also the cleaning staff were friendly and always greeted me. The lobby host Thairyn made our stay in PARK MGM amazing he understood our situation and had things resolved immediately with a noisy neighbor first day very professional and understanding of the customer.  My experience here immediately went from 0 to 100 because of the lobby desk and Thairyn good service! Good check-in check-out experience! There is also Eataly Primrose couple of restaurants here and a nice pool area.
50,Loved our 2022 stay at the Park MGM. This entirely smoke free hotel did not disappoint; beautiful pools Eataly must not be missed Dolby Theatre Aerosmith experience was perfection easy tram access to nearby Aria and Bellagio. Beautiful walkable area with great outdoor hangout spots nearby. Will be back!
50,Eataly has the best food. There is really no need to leave the hotel as far as food goes. Great restaurants night clubs bars and it’s all smoke free. Loved it. Would absolutely stay again. Would love if they added small fridges to the rooms though.
40,Four day stay :Sunday to Thursday. Great staff! Love the location as pretty close to everything. Renovated rooms are nice and Casino easy to navigate! Eatily was great and the other restaurants are good but a little on the pricy side.
50,We go to Vegas every year in rememberence of the matriarch of our family for mother's day. She passed some time ago and she loved Vegas. This year we had 4 generations of strong women. So fun!!! We are already planning next year.
50,Nice non-smoking hotel and casino. Being smoke free in Vegas is a huge plus for me. The facilities are very nice including the restaurants bars gym and pools. All of the staff were friendly. My room was plain and a bit dated but was clean and the a/c was cold. No refrigerator in the room which is annoying if you have leftovers. Spacious bathroom. I would definitely stay again.
40,Resort fees are not included in the exorbant fees and taxes already added to your room costs when you book. Room was nice and very clean. The non-smoking policy is the greatest feature of this hotel hope they never change that.
20,MGM Park is in a great location near to many of the attractions on the South Strip. I was comped my stay so I can't complain about the cost. The Casino and restaurants inside the facility were nice and the Eatily restaurant area was pretty cool. The poor ratings comes strictly from the room located on the 5th floor. The air conditioning in the room was very poor. The hallway was 15 to 20 degrees cooler and we saw many doors left open to get the cool air inside their rooms. (Not necessarily a safe thing to do). In addition the hallways on the floor levels were very very dark as well as the public restrooms in the casino area. I believe this is all due to their attempt to lower their carbon foot print. That may be commendable but it made for uncomfortable nights. In addition the room only had three hangers when we arrived and we had to call down to get additional. Housekeeping did a great job. The room was also very sparsely furnished and one of the power banks near the window was not plugged in because it could not reach an outlet. If you need to work from your room then you may want to find a better equipped hotel. I also think that new hotels in Las Vegas should start installing refrigerators. Instead they want to charge you 30 bucks a night to have one brought up.
40,Everything was good except one of the queen beds the sheet was ripped other than that room simple and clean good view of the strip also a little issue with having a digital key and not having wifi or internet to open the door so we had to wait for around 10 min to go in the room
30,Access to the Park MGM and parking garage is a problem during special events at the T-Mobile Arena. Don’t book a room unless there’s nothing scheduled at the arena or you’re attending an event at the arena.
50,Park MGM is a clean non-smoking hotel. Just big enough so you don't get lost getting around. Restaurants are a little expensive but there are others within reasonable walking distance. Have stayed there before and will go back again. Staff is friendly.
50,We had a wonderful time at Park MGM. It was so nice and relaxing at the pool during two days of our 8 night stay. The casino environment is top notch with clean and fresh air throughout given the no smoking policy. The restaurants are amazing and we really enjoyed Eataly! Also the location is so so convenient to the T- Mobile Arena. We will be back for sure!
50,The rooms are attractive and clean. The staff was awesome. The food at the onsite restaurant was delicious. Drinks were great as well. The location was perfect for attending the concerts at the T Mobile Arena.
50,Room was great for size. Long couch along window gave additional lounging space while in the room. Staff all friendly and accommodating. Located at an amazing point on the strip near many attractions and food options. Great for families as well.
50,The Park MGM is a wonderful hotel and casino. The hotel rooms were a perfect size. The staff were extremely friendly and really made you feel at home. The variety of different types of food at the Eataly and drinks was fantastic. The food and drink prices were very reasonable.
50,Overall amazing stay! Staff was very helpful and friendly. Property is clean and love the fact that it's a non smoking hotel. My only complaint is the parking station to enter and leave it's very hard to scan the barcode because it's down too low instead it should be where you can scan it straight.
50,Non-smoking great restaurants phenomenal Spa and friendly staff will definitely get our return business. We stayed at many different hotels in Vegas but the Park MGM is by far the elite of the group.
50,We loved the great rooms fantastic location exceptional dining options and non-smoking casino. This was our first stay at Park MGM but our 16th Vegas resort hotel stay. The location is exceptional. Lots of great dining and casinos within walking distance and an easy free tram ride to the Bellagio and Aria / Crystals. We have been to Vegas 27 times before this visit and my wife and I always return home with some sort of illness. We did not get sick on this trip and we believe it due to gambling at Park MGM's non-smoking casino. EVERYTHING at Eataly is delicious! We ate at least one meal at Eataly every day we were in Vegas.
50,Had an awesome time as our stay was consistent with past stays. excellent service and friendly people. also any issues that did arise were resolved quickly. I would recommend the park to those prefer a little more relaxed stay yet all the glitz.
50,The hotel is located conveniently near food other casinos and is walkable to other properties. Excellent variety of food choices. Friendly and warm hotel and casino staff. No need to consider other food options as they even have a 24 hour Diner. Great choice for the money!
40,Location is very good in the strip staff is very helpful and friendly thank hey have great eateries. The rooms need updating and the area where the elevators are located to get to your rooms had this funky smell
50,Came for our anniversary dinned in house at Eataly for lunch and Bavettes for dinner. Both were exceptional service. Hotel central to all the things including T-Mobile arena where we attended a hockey game. The rooms are clean and nice and most of all affordable. We will be back!
30,Only plus was this hotel was the venue for Aerosmith. Hotel needs serious updates to live up to its name. Housekeeping staff was very friendly and helpful. Vegas is much more expensive than anticipated
40,We really love Park MGM.The biggest drawback I find is the space in the room for clothing. In the interest of spaving space (I guess) Park has given one door for the bathroom and a sort of closet. It slides back and forth. The closet type area has 4 drawers for clothe and a small space for hanging clothes. It also has a wall safe. I found it super inconvenient not to mention I hit my partner a couple times while trying to open the door to the closet while she was coming out of the bathroom to have to move the clothes to get to the safe and then have to sort of fight the clothes while using the safe. Otherwise the staff was exceptional from the desk at check in to the casino staff to the staff in the resaurants to the house keeping staff. The casino is fun and the slots are reasonably loose. Primrose is a particular favorite to eat. The 3 pools were well situated and not too crowded.
50,Staff was friendly and super attentive to whatever needs we had. Staff would bring up towels and blankets on a timely manner. Pool staff was super helpful and brought us life vests for my kids so that they could enjoy themselves in the pool.
50,Location was great for the Aerosmith concert. Smoke free hotel was amazing. Room stayed cold for the entire stay which allowed a wonderful nights sleep. Casino was never overly busy. The crowd control for the Dolby Theater was an outstanding. Once the line started moving we were in the doors within 5 minutes.
20,For the value of just paying comp I was still very much underwhelmed. The room was rather small even for a King bed. No water bottles no cups etc. Quite noisy room and a very clogged sink. As someone who has worked as a housekeeper in my youth I can’t imagine a room such as mine clearing a supervisor’s review. Mattress was tooo soft and thus very uncomfortable. Felt like I was sinking! Yeah no more Park MGM for me. Thanks tho!
50,Enjoyed our stay here. Place was clean. Did mobile check in got our room and digital keys before the plane took off. Enjoyed the Aerosmith show. Great location as well. Had an issue where we didn't get waited on at one of the restaurants.
40,The property is clean and staff are more then friendly. It was east to get to all the surrounding casinos. However it has no coffee maker or fridge I do know that’s the new trend but I will look for this things next trip
50,Came for the IHeart radio music festival and had a great time very conveniently located with easy access to the festival and the strip. The staff was friendly and the rooms were clean and comfortable.
40,I love the smoke free environment at the Park MGM!! The staff is nice and friendly overall. Rooms are a little smaller than MGM Grand but ok. Food options are ok but not my favorites. Eatily is the best my far.
40,The Park MGM was a great place to stay. It was very clean throughout the property. The front desk staff was always friendly and helpful. The room was a bit small but the red accent color was a cheery surprise. Loved the red in the shower stall too! The free tram was an added bonus. Stay here and you won’t be disappointed!
50,If you are like me and hate when a smoker sits down next to you at a slot machine and blows it in your face then this is the casino for you. This whole property is smoke free and that is fantastic. I love being able to play and breath easily.
20,No happy with the room or the smell in the hallway …. No coffee machine in the room … room storage minimal… beds uncomfortable… TV channels poor selection … over priced for the room … only thing good was location to the concert
10,I didn’t get any sleep throughout the night as I received phone calls on the hotel phone at 4 5 & 6 am. I have heart problems in the hotel phone was super loud started with me every time of night which made my heart hurt for the whole day after that.
20,Check in lady was helpful  did kiosk check in  bell check guy was rude  no type of customer service  guy should be in the back  rooms were nice  someone called noise complaint on us  not sure why  maybe my voice is loud not sure
10,This hotel overbooked and denied over a dozen of our co-workers rooms. We were part of a package of well over 100 rooms each for 8 days. The front desk people were hostile and obnoxious about the overbooking and the manager refused to come down to check in to address the issue. Some of our people waited in the lobby for 12 hours before getting into their rooms. Rooms were not cleaned when we got into them either. Would not recommend Park MGM will not return to Park MGM.
10,Upon checking in went to our room put our bags down and went to dinner. When we arrived there were large fans set up in the hallways which all looked wet. After dinner we went back to our room removed our shoes and immediately realized the carpets were soaking wet. My white socks were covered in brown/gray water. Our room also smelled musty and like mildew. I went down to the front desk because our phone was also not working and was told by a rude women at the desk the carpets were cleaned. This wetness was not just a carpet cleaning but seems like a leak of some kind. After having to be asked multiple times to be moved she gave us a new room but lied and said they were sold out for the month which was not true with multiple rooms showing available online. This was our first time staying at the Park MGM and we ending up checking out a night early after the concert we attended because how unsatisfied we were with the customer service and rooms.
50,It was very clean. The beds were nice and soft. The hotel is well run well taken care of the pool was a ton of fun. We had an excellent time. Can’t wait to go back. Hopefully we will have enough time this year to go back again if not we are definitely going to return next year at some given time during the year.
30,Not impressed. For being on the strip expected a little more. Rooms were very average and actually a little run down. Not as clean as I would have expected. And you can hear EVERYTHING the people in the room with the connecting door are doing and saying. We had multiple parties in our group that stayed on different floors and all of us had noise issues at one point or another.
20,"I booked a room in advance way before my planned stay. When I arrived at the hotel apparently they were ""Over Sold"" which seems insane to me after having booked my room way in advance and having been charged for the room. I needed to pay an uplifted charge to ""upgrade"" to the room I originally booked on line 4/10 experience. I travel to LV a lot for business and have stayed in this hotel 4-5 times before but after this last experience I will likely book elsewhere"
50,This is a very clean hotel. Loved that it was at the center of everything! Staff was wonderful. Rooms were clean. The eateries were so good. The conference rooms and terrace were comfortable and easy to find.
50,Beautiful hotel non-smoking casino friendly and efficient staff quiet rooms great restaurants beautiful pools fun games generous offers.  My cousin and I have stayed here 3 x and we always return because we love this MGM property!
30,Comped unfairly. Substandard suite! We earned a status and maintained a gold card however our suite was outdated and in need of renovations! Disgusting carpet stained and pulled mismatched furniture and broken fixtures. Rundown! Did not feel as though we were treated fairly. Under appreciated as a gold member! Felt dirty! Supervisory staff need to go see the quality of rooms. Suites that are being given out as rewards! Not very rewarding! Made to feel embarrassed when friends came to our suite! Disappointing!
50,Smoke free Casino with easy access to all Casinos. The Tram picks you up or drops you off at Park MGM. The T Mobile Arena is directly across the street. Park MGM has two really good restaurants Bavette”s Steak House and The Primrose. Great location.
20,I was very disappointed with this high priced luxury hotel !! it is over priced and no fridge in room or coffee maker or toiletries and the walls are very thin and halls stink. not a fan too overpriced for what you get
40,Our trip to Las Vegas was a combination of fun and our friends wedding. Two of the days was spent at the pool with gambling at night. The other two days was spent with our friends. The best part of the Park MGM is gambling in a non-smoking casino. There needs to be more private bathrooms for handicapped people in all of the MGM casinos and they all need to be non-smoking or have areas for smokers.
50,Rooms were nice and big and clean the bathroom was Also big and nice clean towels and sheets enjoyed the pool area with plenty of space to lounge the restaurants were also good the food and wine were awesome
50,Our stay at Park MGM was exceptionally wonderful. We realized quickly that the air quality was fabulous and found out shortly that it was a no smoking casino. The room was clean and roomy. The location of excellent eating choices made it one of the best trips ever!
50,Girls trip. Had a wonderful time at Park MGM. Loved the restaurant Primrose. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Bathroom a little small. Otherwise the room was great. Great pillows and nice bed.
40,Overall this hotel has a great feel friendly service and some of the better dining options on the strip. We had an amazing meal at NoMad Library and really enjoyed Eataly. The rooms themselves could use updating. They feel dated and we could hear the people in the next room all too clearly. Still a top pick on the strip based on the property overall.
50,Stayed here to go see Aerosmith at Dolby Live. Was very convenient...choice of 5 pools around 10 restaurants next to Dolby Live. View from room of Strip was OK but couldn't see up it because of a blocking building.
20,Air conditioning turns off when not moving inside the room room hotter than hallway hot at night smells of deodorant- repair guy just explained how the motion sensor worked rather than actually fix the problem gave a $100 food cert to buy us off that we didn’t use
50,Andres was the service technician who fixed our air conditioner after a really uncomfortable night with it not running. He was FANTASTIC and went the extra mile to make sure we were enjoying our stay and had what we needed. He asked if there was anything else he could look at while he was here and welcomed us to the city. Andres is exactly the person every business needs and should be thankful to have. Thank you Andres for being so wonderful and helping us have a great experience.
50,Great location. Short ride from airport. Ride share area easy to find. Great food options. Have stayed many time always a great stay. Being smoke free hotel is the biggest plus. Nice pool area. Easy to get to aria too
40,Clean and smoke free. Located in a great place on the strip. Only complaint was that there was no fastfood options in the hotel at all. That resulted in long wait times to buy food anywhere in the hotel. Starbucks was definitely too small to handle the amount of business it was getting every morning. The pools are surrounded by tall buildings so the amount of sun at the pools is pretty limited.The housekeeping staff is fabulous!
10,The room was pretty bad. Especially if staying for a work function. Bad plumbing. No clock. Insufficient lighting. No place to put clothes have to live out of your suitcase. So little space that the iron sits in the room outside the small wardrobe.
50,I recommend Park MGM. Not only is it super clean and modern. It’s so close to everything. We walked everywhere. Right next door to TMobile Arena. Which was great for the concert we attended. Going back in October. Can’t wait!
50,Clean easy check in process right next to t mobile arena which was perfect for us. Short Uber to the airport. Blah blah blah blah I need 200 characters to publish this review and now I’m almost complete
40,We always stay for five days and the rooms were serviced every day.Park MGM is located in a perfect spot for all kinds of activities.Park MGM is also located to other Resorts with lots of shops and dining
50,The smoke free environment was a refreshing experience for Vegas. The dinning was top notch from breakfast burrito's at the poolside to the fabulous Italian food at Eataly. (This place is so much more than a food court) you could eat every meal there breakfast to dinner and not be disappointed!!! Location is great as well close to New York New York (10 minute walk) . The tram to the Bellagio is free and quick. Your next stay in Vegas should be at the Park you won't be disappointed.
50,I have stayed at Park MGM twice this year and it is by far the best of the mid range priced properties on the Las Vegas strip. It is extremely clean smoke free & the staff is wonderful. My room was immaculate. The food options are great and the location can’t be beat. Situated right next to T Mobile arena and The Dolby Theatre makes this the property to stay at for concerts & events. I will certainly come back in the future.
40,We've been to Las Vegas several times and usually stay at the bigger hotels...Venetian Paris MGM..just to name a few. I was comped a couple of nights here and wanted to check it out and stay in some place different. Check-in was a nightmare. The room was supposed to be ready anytime after 3 pm and we arrived at 11 pm only to be told the room wasn't ready and they didn't know when it would be. We were coming from the east coast....so this was very late for us. I complained and they did take 2 resort fees off. We went to get something to eat and came back around 1:00 am and the room still wasn't ready. The young lady working the desk was very apologetic but they really didn't have a plan for us. Finally I asked if a king was available...we were booked for 2 queens...and she got us in. In the morning I was asked how everything was going and I told my story and did get $50 in resort credit for the 3 of us for our troubles. The resort itself is clean non-smoking and has a great location. We did eat in a couple of the restaurants and they were fabulous. The staff was friendly and the rooms were clean. There is no refrigerator...but we knew this going in. Park MGM was perfect for a group of 5 women...we could easily meet at the bar take the tram down the strip and no smoking was a bonus. It's a quieter casino not a lot of night life...but we weren't looking for that. Other than the check in....the stay was great. We enjoyed the restaurants and the location and would consider returning if we could be guaranteed a smoother check in.
50,I have stayed a few times now at The Park MGM and always a great time. The staff is always great and go over and beyond expectations. The location is perfect for any stay in Vegas. I am always excited to come back.
20,There was a long wait to get the room after they texted numerous times asking when we would arrive. Was supposed to be ready by 3pm and it was 6pm when I finally went to the desk and complained. The strip view room was not available and they had no idea when it would be. They gave us dining credit to pay the difference. Why not change the price??? Anyway when we got into the room it was not clean either. There was literally a poop swipe on the light switch. We had just traveled 12 hours and were tired didn't want to go back downstairs wait in another long line just to find out there were no other rooms so we Clorox wiped every surface in the room. Upon checkout... all benefits were not applied and we had to ask again why we did not get our credits properly before checking out or we would have been billed an extra $120. This is our second stay at Park MGM... The only reason I am giving them two stars is the location is awesome and Eatly is something to experience.
10,Second stay at Park MGM and disappointed with our room. Elevator and common area smelled musty and or mildew. Shower area had mold on the floor corner and sides and the bathroom sink didn't appear to be clean. Lastly a small bottle of fiji water is $18 - excessive for any hotel.
30,I have a broken foot and I am in a walking boot of course I was given a room at the end of the hall not very convenient but I'm just a lowly Pearl member. Room is starting to wear no roller bed or extra linen for 3rd guest in double room. There are way better options for the price paid. Casino is okay and the location is great other than that not much else to say.
50,My husband and I enjoyed this resort the most. We stayed in at least 6 other resorts on the strip and this was our favourite . The hotel itself was very clean  the rooms were comfortable and we enjoyed spending time in the casino.The variety of food and restaurants at the entrance to the hotel know as Eataly was a very nice experience.
50,If you are a smoker this hotel is NOT for you. May I recommend Caesar’s - that filled with smoke.  Convenient location especially if you are seeing a show at Dolby Live. Nice pools and friendly wait staff. Housekeeping were cool too.
10,Stay at a real resort. This feels like it’s a bootleg hotel. All old people boring nightlife. The rooms are all outdated. The food choices are terrible relative to other casinos. You are better off staying at the actual big name resorts that have real food gambling and nightlife.
40,Clean & fresh hotel great water pressure missed the refrigerators in the room but overall great place to stay with a great location. AC was temperamental but wasn’t a deal breaker by any means. Highly recommend.
10,The floors smell like mold. The hallways are dark. The rooms are very dated. You get either a army color green room or a red room. And most importantly the beds and pillows are very uncomfortable. I would not recommend this hotel. And it took three calls to housekeeping to get new towels.
50,It’s right on the strip. Clean rooms and hotel and casino have a great distinct smell (no cigarette smell) Staff is very friendly and restaurants at this hotel and amazing with delicious food. Will definitely be staying here again for my 4th time.
10,The rooms are very old the carpet throughout is so gross! I would never stay here again. The smell is awful in the rooms also! The only positive i can say is the restaurants are fantastic!! But I wouldn’t ever recommending staying in the hotel!!!
30,Hotels fine for Vegas standards definitely on the low end of service levels and cleanliness. SMB options are pretty good. Casino floor was maintained well and casino staff was very friendly. Just rooms operation staff aren't very trained well
30,Our experience is difficult to rate. Our check in was a nightmare. Despite having reservations for months we discovered at check-in after waiting for over an hour in line that they had oversold their rooms and there might be a room available after midnight (we got to the hotel around 9 and finally got to the front desk a little after 10 pm). We tried to use the app but it wouldn’t allow us to check in (because there were no rooms we found out later). We got back in line at 11:30 and close to 12:30 am we finally got our room. The staff was exceptional. The room was clean and comfortable. The pool area and casino were both above average.
50,"This was our second visit to Park MGM from Vancouver Canada in five months. We love the fact there's no smoking allowed anywhere and also really like the resort's smaller size which makes it easy to get around and to never get lost in the casino. :o) The staff were all friendly and helpful and our suite was spotless and well maintained during our stay. We also like that there are three smaller pools to choose from -- we chose the adults-only pool everyday. And while everyone was having a good time the pool isn't quite the ""scene"" so many other Vegas pools are. Park has more of a laid-back vibe to it which we really appreciate."
50,The Park MGM was exceptional from the very beginning at Check-In. The hotel staff is always happy to assist and provide any thing you need. The resort has a no smoking rule which is great. It was right next T-Mobile arena and restaurants amazing.
40,Park MGM is a great hotel. Nice casino really fantastic restaurants and clubs and all of the staff are very friendly and helpful. The Dolby stage is one of the best live music venues anywhere especially for artists in residency - in our case Aerosmith! Easy to get around too!
50,Stayed here for 8 nights. We had a room on floor 25 with a great view over the T-mobile arena and surrounding hills. The room was a decent size and well furnished. Bathroom nice and modern. The casino is non smoking which was a bonus. We didn’t use the pools but they looked good plenty of space and sunbeds. Staff were very helpful and sorted a couple of small niggles we had. We ate at Eataly twice nice selection of food especially if you want something quick.
30,The room is small no fridge no coffee pot which I believe should come with the room for the price resort fees parking fees etc... Will not stay there again! Btw not even the suites come with a fridge because my daughter stayed in a suite.
50,The Park MGM wS an excellent stay. The property is non smoking which is a game changer. Plus the staff is very friendly and the hotel is very clean. Overall I would recommend this hotel. The MGM rewards needs to be changed back to how it was.
30,Found used masks and hair curler behind the couch after my phone had fell back there. Full of dust and all kinds of other junk back there. Really shows you that they only do the minimum to keep the rooms clean!
50,We stayed here because of the Canelo vs GGG fight at T-Mobile Arena and our stay was perfect. Ask for Juan at the High Limit Lounge. Great bartender and drinks. Great service and always attentive to his customers.
40,Great non smoking casino room was very comfortable albeit the shower was a bit weak. Awesome proximity to everything on the strip loved the tram connecting Park to Aria and Belagio. Will stay here again
50,This casino is non smoking and was so fresh and clean. We will definitely be back because you can play and enjoy and not feel sick when you are there. It was very busy so more casinos should follow park mgm and their non smoking
10,Room had pubic hair on bed and in the shower. I contacted customer service and no response. I was told the pool was open until 8pm and was kicked out within minutes of arrival because they wanted to close at 6pm
30,Perfect place if you want to be on the strip and attending an event at the T-Mobile arena also close enough to get to allegiant stadium. The steakhouse was great and in the hotel. Off the Record was a fun place to dance and have drinks..
50,This was a beautiful hotel. Very clean and quiet. All the staff were very friendly and accommodating. Good location. Traveled by myself for my daughter’s wedding and felt very safe here. I liked that there was coffe and breakfast available in the lobby.
50,We stayed here after a few days in the Utah national parks and it was relaxing and a well run hotel. The front desk staff were great and our room was clean and very comfortable! Good location for walking to other hotels and shows and we loved the nonsmoking feature of the entire casino!
40,Overall my stay was satisfactory. Comfortable beds room and easy easy to navigate the casino area. Good access to other hotels. Non-smoking was great. Rules were quiet room temperature was good good towels and Bathroomaccessories
40,I like the automated check in areas. i like that there was a Starbucks downstairs. I had a nice view of the strip. Ac works well. Bed was pretty comfy. No fridge in the room but I didnt need it and that was no biggie. overall a pretty decent stay.
50,Probably one of the cleanest hotels I’ve been to on the strip. Great food options. The location is great walking distance from so many MAJOR entertainment venues and they have so many shows at the Dolby theater located in the hotel you won’t be able to see them all
50,Very clean and location was great. Will definitely recommend to stay. Staff was great. Check in was easy and fast. We will be back and will not stay any where else but Park MGM. Hotel is also kid friendly and love the fact there’s a no smoking policy.
40,Overall the Park MGM was outstanding with one exception the Disability room...the room was roomy but the lack of adornment was horrible. A picture or 5 tiny pictures on a HUGE wall should have said loud and clear bigger pictures are better in a room this size. Extremely dreary to be in and the view was even worse. So even if you are disabled I would recommend another room because it is obvious disabled people do not rate pretty.
40,We stayed at the property for a weekend getaway. I picked this hotel because it was centrally located to the concert venues. I was also interesting staying at a resort that was smoke free as I do get migraines being around People who smoke. The property itself is good. The staff are very friendly and always willing to help out. My only complaint was that the room did smell like smoke.  Overall it was a good place to stay at. Plenty to do the food at The restaurants was really good. Really enjoyed the Primrose for breakfast and the mimosas were amazing. Italian eatery has so many different options. Love the pizza.
50,Seriously what an dream to not be swallowed up by smoke!!! This casino smells great! I don’t want to stay anywhere else. We had an issue with the toilet not flushing my boyfriend had in working in 1 minute. Walls were thin. Definitely staying here again! Thank you for making a while casino nonsmoking
50,Great place to stay. We love the non-smoking atmosphere. Central to the Strip. Really good gaming area with Eataly as one of my favorite eating places I’ve Las Vegas. Has three pools to go to and never gets boring
50,We stayed in the Park MGM for three nights. The property is very clean and most importantly smoke free which is fantastic if you abhor cigarettes like me. There are plenty of food options with Eataly being the best one. The prices at Eataly are budget friendly as well. The rooms are fine nothing special but serve the purpose of a Vegas room which is for sleeping showering and ______. The table minimums on the strip are $15 and then go up from there in the evening at most properties if you want cheaper tables you have to go off strip or to Fremont. However at Park MGM there are multiple tables that stay at $15 for the duration of the night which is nice. Overall I was very pleased with Park MGM and would absolutely stay there again.
50,Fun convenient casino lots of good food optionswith great pools plenty of gambling options.The music venue is awesome and makes a concert a great experience. Lots of food options around the casino and so close to the T mobile arena
40,Very clean and refreshing atmosphere. Staff was top notch. The food court had many selections and nice scenery. I highly recommend staying at Park MGM if you have the opportunity. I really enjoyed my stay.
30,We booked our reservations months in advance (king size bed) and called the hotel the morning of our stay. On arrival advised king beds were no available. Had to request a manager & my “member status” was asked. Magically a king bed was available! Not the way to start our vacation!    We selected this hotel for the location next to T-Mobile Arena because we were there for a boxing fight. Go GGG!
50,Stayed for a few days in August. Enjoyed that the whole property was non-smoking - I get tired of the smell of pot everywhere in Vegas these days. Special shout out to Hank the security guy in Eataly - not only keeps you safe but is a sommelier and very knowledgable about Italian wines. Pointed out the wine tasting bar and store at the foot of Eataly - wine flights at happy hour was the best! Thanks Hank for making our stay that much more enjoyable!
20,Paid for early check in. Room supposed to be ready at 11am and did not get room until 3pm. Long long lines to check in and mobile check in did not work. No mini fridge unless you request one and then it was $35 a day. Walls paper thin in room. Rooms were clean
40,This was a solo birthday trip for me. The staff is amazing and the restaurants are great. The room was a little dated and needs a little tender love and care. Check in was seamless and getting my luggage to me was done in a timely manner.
50,Park MGM is smoke free which for non smokers is an amazing thing. The dealers are friendly and there is a nice blend of limits on their table games. The tram is easily accessible. T- mobile stadium is literally beside the resort. Definitely a great option if you are coming to a game or event at T- mobile
50,The Park MGM is a favorite place to stay. It's conveniently located non-smoking and has some of the best food options. Eatly is amazing! Be sure to get one of the renovated rooms if you can as the showers are great! The only downside is no fridge in the room.
30,The casino pool restaurants were all great. The rooms were nothing special. Our room was a handicap room 9 108. I didn’t realize till the last day. Bed was very low no drawers half closet no refrigerator shower was big and great but overall the room was not good at any price.
50,We are sure that we made an excellent choice to vacation as a couple we celebrated our 25th wedding anniversary in a well located place with very nice facilities within this place you find everything cafeteria casino restaurant bar music and of course a section of wonderful swimming pools. plus an amazing view from our room.
20,View of the strip was great . Location was also great. Rooms and corridors were slightly out dated . “ self check in “ counters should be skipped all together  head straight to the counter . Do not purchase the room service food  head else where .
30,Room was starkly modern with outdated and uncomfortable furniture. TV remote was missing and we had to ask service personnel for one. Some missing amenities like shower cap. All personnel were friendly and did a great job. Pools were awesome!
50,Park MGM is in a good strip location. Clean and quiet. Plenty restaurant options. Easy check in and check out. No smoking hotel is a perfect option for individuals with allergies and or a low tolerance to cigarette smoke. Will definitely be staying at the Park MGM again for future visits.
30,"We stayed at the Park MGM to see Aerosmith (who were awesome.)    Pros -    Casino is petite but well laid out  You don't have to go through the casino to check in  Eataly being attached was awesome!  The pool was not bad - but it gets a LOT of shade  Directly across from the hockey rink.    Cons -    Rooms are small by Vegas standards  Rooms have a ""barn door"" that was really annoying  Hallways are downright creepy    If you made me I'd stay there again and be OK."
10,The only upside was the fact that the entire place is smoke free . Other than that it was just a very lack luster experience. The hallway to the room was so dark  felt like you needed a flashlight to be able to see. It was just as dark in the room and did not feel like a fun Vegas experience.
50,I used to stay in this hotel when it was the Monte Carlo I needed an upgrade but now that it’s the park MGM I love it. The non-smoking environment in the casino is great if you’re a non-smoker. The room was very clean had an awesome bed and a nice shower with a good shower waterflow. It’s a great hotel. I would definitely stay there again.
30,We had a decent experience at Park MGM in Las Vegas. We stayed at this hotel because we came to see an Aerosmith concert at the hotel. There was no coffee or coffee maker in the room but there was a Starbucks downstairs causing us to spend $10 plus a day on coffee. There was no fridge in the room so we ended up purchasing a styrofoam cooler. We found an ice maker but it was sort of hidden.
30,Park MGM was not what I expected. The room was clean great water pressure in the shower and an awesome food court (Eataly). But my room was red with old furniture(the couple of pieces it had) and the hallway was dimly lit. The sofa was flat and lifeless. The table was scratched up and dented. I understand it was a comp room but I still had to pay $144 dollars for a “comp” room! I guess since it was an MGM property I expected a whole lot more. Also the 24-hour eating place they had the food was terrible. I had waffle fries and chicken wings. The fries were old and the wings were like nothing I’ve ever tasted and not in a good way. The casino was small but had a wide variety of machines and Park MGM is located in a good spot. But still the room was a big disappointment. Security was great. I felt safe and secure besides the dimly lit hallway
30,So we stayed here because of friends. Eataly was amazing but so many little problems. No fridge in room (500 per night paying). A/c really sketchy. App never worked to check in or to check out. I was at an mgm resort the week before in Vegas cosmopolitan and had the same issue with the app.
20,Cons:    1.The lobby smells like poop.  2.The check out system for MGM hasn’t worked for us two weekends in a row.. last stay we were at Cosmo which was bought my MGM  3. No coffee maker.  4. Extremely loud.  5. Room was painted a dark dingy red.  6. Tiny safe.  7. The check in app didn’t let us know when the room was ready even though it was for over a hour.  8. Tiny ice bucket especially for not haven’t a fridge.  9. Overpriced because it’s called to the Arena where events are.    Pros:    1. Eatily  2. Less busy than other casinos.  3. The convenience store was decently stocked.    Will not be returning
50,Clean casino relaxing super friendly staff. Housekeeping cleans your room daily which is rare nowadays.    Middle of strip close to everything quiet rooms for great sleep.  Parking has the red/green lights so easy to tell where open spaces are.
50,The adult family experience was superb with all the mgm resort amenities. The concert we went to and distance from hotel to hotel was perfect. Th staff at the MGM resorts we visited and used was amazing. We are already planning our next family visit with MGM Resorts.  😎👍😎👍
30,Made reservations to stay here in the Nightingale Suite. Advised hotel of arrival time as they requested. My arrival time was 12:30 PM. I understand they cannot guarantee a room if I arrive early but if check in time is 3:00 PM should the room not be ready? Room was finally ready at 4:20. Gorgeous room. Huge and extremely well decorated. Color scheme worked for me. Bar area was awesome. Window seat huge and comfortable. Bathroom lacked a little pizzazz but it was doable. Let’s talk about the check in process. For one the room was not ready at 3:00 when I checked in. It is not my problem the hotel was sold out. After a long day of travel I expect my room to be ready at 3:00PM especially if you say check in is at 3:00PM. Time is money. I have stayed at other hotels on The Strip and never had a problem checking in early and on Saturday’s too. Check in kiosk is a mess. You have limited amount of lobby assistants and there is no queuing system that tells them who is the next person requiring assistance. You have to track them down to get assistance. However I can see they are trying to do their best as they are bombarded from several directions with check in questions. One station is set up with three check in terminals. I believe there are four stations and sometimes there were only two lobby assistants available. So you can see how 12 guests checking in can be overwhelming for two lobby assistants. I intended to stay another night and was fed up with the length of time waiting for my room. I was ready to take any room as I got tired and frustrated of waiting. Ironically when I was going to ask to get any room my room was “just released” when lobby assistant checked but I never received a text my room was ready until I was in the room. Room is absolutely gorgeous I just might stay another night...........after all I am already checked in😂.
10,Just not satisfied expected the rooms to be fully cleaned with new linen have dresser’s for your clothing plumbing was horrible slow draining sink  which is the worst when there’s two trying to brush never again
20,Waited more than 5hrs to finally know that room was cancelled by mistake by the front desk staff. Terrible beds old sunken mattresses. No kettle complimentary coffee or a fridge in the room whatsoever.
20,Not very good. Room not made on Saturday. Returned at 8:45 pm. Informed front desk room not made. Waited 2 hours for maid to be sent. Finally at 11:00 pm room was made. They only changed out towels and made bed. No vaccum or empty trash cans. Will not stay here again.
40,Our Las Vegas visit was to celebrate a 50th wedding anniversary for my in-laws. The staff was very friendly and I'm in love with the mobile check-in experience. When this property was Monte Carlo it was my favorite place to stay in Las Vegas; I absolutely loved their buffet therefore I was very disappointed to find out that the buffet in Park MGM was closed.
50,From the beginning of check-in at the front desk to greet housekeeping to quick valet service it’s always a great experience here! So many places to eat at and choices. We also eat at best friend…yum! The eatery felt like you were traveling internationally. Also the rooms and the gaming are very clean.
50,Smoke-free environment throughout the property makes this a much more pleasant experience for a non-smoker. Good central location - connected to Aria and close to the Tram to Bellagio friendly staff good restaurants and Eataly is a great bonus.
10,Stay at the NOMAD! We switched rooms 3 times because Park MGM was filthy! we found Long hairs and pubic hairs all over bathroom stained sheets stained carpet wad of gum on shower floor empty Red Bull cans in room wrappers on floor. Smelt! Don’t stay here stay in the NOMAD which is amazing!
30,The bathroom was dirty. The room was hot. We were charged two times for parking on two of our days there. When we asked the check in clerk about paying for parking we were told we would find that out at check out.
40,Nice updated room great location hallways need some updating smoke free casino a big plus. All the staff we talked with were very nice. Pool area was very large 3 pools and the Italian food area in the front was great. Also the Starbucks near the pool has to be the fastest one I have ever been too. Even with a dozen people in front of me I was in and out in less than 10 min.
40,Good hotel I love that it is non smoking. great location close to restaurants I did had issues with parking that unfortunately did not get resolved. But overall I always choose to stay here when I’m Vegas.
50,Loved the central location and non-smoking. Hotel is easy to navigate rideshare pick up just off lobby. Lots of great choices for food. Eately is an amazing experience! Dolby theater was awesome for Aerosmith concert.
50,Great atmosphere friend staff already have a trip to come back can’t wait it was a wonderful time. Kind of small gym but over all nice hotel in general pool areas are very nice lots of game options in the casino
10,If you like old and dirty then this is the hotel for you. Nothing better than damp crusty carpet and torn bloody sheets to get you in that Vegas mood. The coolest part of this hotel is how the guest room hallways look exactly like that scene out of the Shining. The only thing missing was the ghosts.
50,The location is great and being a non-smoking hotel is why I stay there. The casino is clean and there are good food choices. The slot machines are far enough apart that you don't feel that everyone is on top of you!
50,Nice cozy rooms clean all around! Great food and amenities. Staff was friendly helpful and knowledgeable. We saw a concert at the Dolby theater inside and it was amazing! Will definitely stay there again!
40,The staff have always been incredibly friendly. Property is very clean and well kept. The non-smoking atmosphere was much more appreciated by me than I even expected. I will definitely stay there again for that reason alone! Love the pool as well chill vibe and plenty of space to relax.
50,This was my first time in Vegas and we chose the Park MGM because we were headed to see Aerosmith and felt it would be easier to stay in the same hotel as the concert. It was clean quiet in the room friendly and close to everything. We would definitely stay again!
50,my first time in Vegas and I really enjoyed my stay at the hotel. the staff was very welcoming and informative on things that we could do they really helped me navigate my way through the city. I would recommend Park MGM to others
20,"I was pleased to find out the facility was non-smoking as we walked in however that excitement quickly faded once I checked into my room. Despite the property claiming it was ""recently renovated"" I didn't even want to remove my shoes. Room was dark dirty furniture was scratched and banged up bathroom was dirty sink was clogged and would not drain. We tried to resolve these issues with the hotel but were unable and ended up moving our party to another property. Buyer beware."
10,The lobby at hotel and in room was poorly lid. It had a depressing feel. Didnt have master light switch either. Overall decor seem like cheap quality. For a mgm property in good location of strip just a waste
30,"Needed to bring my own water heater for tea. Was chastised by staff for asking ""Nobody on the strip offers water kettles or coffee machines"" I was told. Went out and bought my own. Front desk staff cold and annoyed to print out my five day parking invoice. As long as you dont need these things and are good with a person-less app check in experience youll may enjoy the location in the middle of the strip."
50,Easy to get around and tram made it easy to go to other hotels. Also you can go through other hotels without using the tram. Rooms were clean and actually bigger then I excepted it to be. View was pretty bad but that was ok since we kept the curtains drawn.
50,A weekend trip to see Usher at the Park MGM. You can’t beat the convenience of leaving your room to go downstairs to the show without leaving the building. Absolutely loved the location of the hotel along with the amenities. There’s plenty of places to eat all within the hotel. The room was not upscale but was proper. The bed was super comfy. Housekeeping was fantastic throughout the trip. I also enjoyed the fitness center. I appreciated the use of your mobile phone as the door key. I would definitely stay here again.
50,Had a great stay at Park MGM. Love the smoke free experience. The table games were well managed with nice dealers and floor managers. The only 2 suggestions would be a small refrigerator in the room and maybe add a poker room. Everything else was great. I love the app and check in was wonderful. We eat at Best Friends for the BBQ and several times at the Eataly area food was great. Service was wonderful. Thanks RR
20,The PARK is now combined with Nomad and the whole property is non smoking. Their main webpage doesn't tell you that. The rooms have a 5 inch wide shelf under the TV to set your stuff. No place in the bathroom for personal feminine hygiene stuff to remain private. There is not a comfortable couch or chair there is now an uncomfortable red bench.
40,Park MGM was a fantastic experience the hotel was immaculate. The entire property (that I experienced) was clean orderly refreshed and smelled amazing. Not to mention the stellar service from the entire staff but particularly from Housekeeping. I'd recommend Park MGM for a multitude of reasons. It boils down to a few for me cleanliness customer experience customer service and that forever so enjoyable brand new feeling. HIGHLY recommend.
50,We exclusively stay at this hotel since the redo because it is smoke free even in the casino. We can’t STAND weed smoke. Great restaurants. We don’t care for the red rooms and they need more table games open.
40,Strategically located (just off center strip)  Very Relaxing Resort (3 different pools) laid back atmosphere  Amazing food at EATALY (must try the Chicken or Steak shish-ka-bobs)  Fresh pasta made to order (Must have Meatballs)  can’t wait to return !
50,Great fun! I have been to Vegas numerous times and I had never visited Park MGM! I will definitely stay there and or visit again on my next trip. The hotel was very cozy.  The only problem encountered while there was the bell stand did not seem to be very organized. We had to wait an hour for our luggage to come up only after calling and this was during a slow period.
50,First the staff all over Park were very friendly and helpful. The food at Primrose was great. Totally loved that Park is completely smoke free. A literal breath of fresh air in Vegas. The pool had a great vibe.
50,We loved the fact that there is no smoking allowed. Very comfortable rooms. friendly personnel. Location is excellent is in the middle of all shopping and restaurants. T-mobile Arena is next door and very convenient.
50,This place rocks. 3 pools and plenty of beautiful servers fresh towels no lines for anything love the uniforms the servers wear super hot great pool Eatly was to die for and it was an ease getting anywhere
50,Beautiful property that happens to be smoke free. Great restaurant selections. Friendly price staff as well.  Machines wasn’t as lose as one would like but I had a great time.    The USHER experience was EVERYTHING. I’ll definitely return since his residency has been extended. Dolby Live is steps away from the elevator and not a bad seat in the house.
40,The overall experience at Park MGM was great. The staff was very friendly the rooms were clean the shower has the best water pressure ever. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was the room was a little underwhelming. There was nothing wrong with it it was just kind of blah. If you don't need to be wowed by your room Park MGM is a great choice in a great location for a Vegas weekend.
50,Love that it is a non smoking hotel checkin and checkout is so easy you can do everything on your phone. Housekeeping is fast and friendly same with the lobby staff. Great location on the Las Vegas strip have a great amount of show and the casino and restaurants are amazing.
50,If in Las Vegas this is one of the nicer hotels. Very clean and friendly staff and extraordinary food at Lala noodles. Located in the middle of almost anything that you could want. Catching a bus from this hotel was quick and easy
20,Low ceilings no fridge in the rooms random pictures in the room floor super low to the floor small dresser in the closet that takes up all the room in the small closet and room service is a joke hope you like cold expensive food.
40,We love the Park MGM- and while we understand there may be staffing issues they need to keep their quality levels high to maintain the love.    The issue was the in room bathroom/ shower… there was hair all over the walls. Not huge but if they skimp on cleaning that we are forced to wonder what else they neglected to clean.    Overall a lovely place and are likely to return. Plus being the only fully non-smoking hotel on the strip is a huge plus!
50,Came to Vegas to relax go see some shows and to propose to my girlfriend. The hotel and staff were great. We will definitely stay at the Park MGM again. Only thing I wish was for the rooms to have had a refrigerator in the room. Other than that it was an amazing experience.
50,Had a nice solo trip. Great experience great location great service! Love that it was smoke free. Recommend signing up for their rewards program I save a bit by booking the room directly.    Was disappointed with Best Friend food.. it was not what I expected. Eataly was pretty decent.
50,I love how clean and smoke free this hotel is! And the restaurants are amazing. Go see Tony at the bar at Eataly. And then you have the Haus of Gaga store which is amazing. The location is perfect for visiting other casinos and shopping and eating.
40,Center of strip - good as home base while exploring the city. Fun casino with latest slots and delicious food at restaurants like Eataly and Best Friend and amazing concert venue in tha Dolby Theater. Definitely will stay again.
40,Visited the Park MGM mainly because the Usher concert was happening at the Dolby Center which is located inside the Park MGM…..staff was friendly and room was above average…..will definitely stay again
10,The website seemed super glamorous modern and up to date. The room was dark and smelly. The towels were so bleached and thin…We received two towels a day.. no robes. The description said beautiful hard wood floors.. the floors were super thin dirty carpet. The room had a gross oder with rements of some sort of body part on the window. Gross and we will not be back  and will let our friends know not to go as well.
10,Demanded a refund at 4am when we arrived after seeing this room and uncomfortable bed..very ugly room too...finally gave me my money back I went to treasure island..halls were dirty..smelled like cigs in room..save your money
30,Had a better experience at Treasure Island. Restaurants were better selection also. The ones at Park MGM are all odd cuisines there was not something for everyone. Room never got cold as the hotel is on a cold water AC system. so yeah.
20,Thought this was a nicer hotel it’s so dated! The carpeted floors the dark weird bird print wall paper it felt very 80s. Our room was not cleaned thoroughly we found a bottle cap behind the door and the carpet and red velvet loveseat were clearly stained. In general the hotel smells stale. We thought an MGM resort would be nice especially at this price point but definitely not worth the $$. The casino is crammed and dingy as well. Restaurants are not worth the price especially Side Betty Grill the only one open late in the evening. Small menu and so overpriced a burger is like $23! Best thing was the ability to check in and out online and use a digital key saved time as the front desk was always busy.
40,Rooms are decent to nice. Housekeeper are nice. The great location was appreciated. Food options lacking but other properties are close by. Dolby Live is a nice space. Usher was great. I will be back.
10,We were very disappointed in the lack of cleanliness throughout the hotel. The pool towels had yellow stains room covers were stained carpet was stained foul odor throughout the hallways lack of proper air conditioning on the higher floors.....very uncomfortable stay. The only plus was the location being where the concert was hosted that we flew in for.
40,A very nice if somewhat old property (they took over a previous hotel and renovated the furnishings. I agree with other reviewers that the rooms should have a mini refrigerator although there are ice buckets. Gambling here is pricey but that is similar at most strip properties. Beware of resort fees that are not waived unless you are gold or above on rewards.Veterans are rewarded with Pearl status which gets you free guest parking and 10% off in dining venues.
40,The Park MGM is my go to hotel in Vegas. Perfect location. Amazing food on site. I had an amazing brunch with live music at the Nomad bar. Always amazing shows and even a great night club. I didnt even leave the hotel the last time I went. Everything was at my fingertips.
30,The staff were all great and the place was clean and smoke free. Thats the good. The steakhouse is also great but thats really a separate review topic. The bad long walks from the rooms to get to the strip thin walls so you'll hear your neighbors talking at about any volume unsatisfactory showers and narrow bathrooms. Also I'll grant them it was September but the ac didnt want to keep the room as cool as Id like. I think for the pricepoint they had there are better options on the strip.
50,The hotel and casino were clean friendly and inviting. This was out of the norm for what we experience at a few of the other major casinos we played at. Location to many activities and places we wanted to visit was perfect.
30,I was excited about staying here and at first there were some major issues that were not addressed until halfway through the my stay. I appreciate the leadership and how they tried to recover the situation but I was really bothered by how one of the casino hosts and front desks agents were cold provide poor customer service and really created an atmosphere where I did not feel welcomed or valued. It was a jarring experience but I am grateful for those who stood to remedy the situation and provide excellent customer service
20,Staff from check in casino to check out and restaurants were great and wonderful hard working people. The rooms were filthy neglected and not what I would expect from an mgm property. Dirty sheets pillow cases carpet not vacuumed and a half broken air conditioner - rooms are not up to a standard that one would expect at any hotel upon check in
50,Loved the accommodations great casino clean lux rooms and amazing staff. Easy to navigate. Great restaurant options delicious food and clubs. You could just stay at the Park MGM the entire time and be happy.
50,I highly recommend this casino very clean non-smoking very friendly staff and waitresses are constantly coming over for drinks never have to look for them rooms are very clean overall this is amazing place great food
40,Nice hotel with minor inconveniences. Location is central for a lot of attractions. 20min walk to the strip. La La Noddles located inside was a bit pricey but the food  was good. Overall stay was a 6/10.
20,The only good part about the hotel was the Usher concert & not having to leave the hotel to attend. The bed was worn uncomfortable & too low to the ground. The room & hallway were dark & dreary. The couch in the room was old stained & worn. I was supposed to have a strip view room but our view was of the top of the lower building & HVAC equipment. This room definitely wasn’t worth the nightly rate.
30,There are many reviews whether on Google or on YouTube vlogs about the kind of stay one would experience at this hotel. One perk would be the non-smoking environment every time I returned to the hotel it was a breath of fresh air! The restaurants are 10/10!!! However I do not like unnecessary surprises especially when the surprise involves spending my money unnecessarily. I missed the fine print online that explained that the total I saw while booking the hotel did not include the resort fees. So when I arrive to the hotel I paid almost double for what I booked. It’s not that I don’t have the money to pay for my stay I just couldn’t understand why the full expected total including resort fees was not applied at the time of booking.
40,The hotel is central and easily accessible to nearby hotels. The rooms are a good size and clean. It’s very minimalist decor. Wish there was an in-room fridge. Overall great place and will definitely be back soon.
50,Needed to find a place quickly and found a room at the park mgm for a good rate. It was a busy weekend in LV and after booking the room the mobile app made check in a breeze! Was able  Yo arrange my parking on the app and receive my digital room key. I’ve never had an easier check in experience. My room was clean and had a great view. Park mgm had a great location next to everything you want to be near on the strip. Check out was just as easy and concierge was friendly. Looking forward to my next stay at the park mgm
20,The room I checked into was not clean . I was changed to a room and the heat didn’t work . Staff member refused to put my girlfriend money in her hand . The engineer came to the room and did not fix anything. The list goes on
30,I like the Park MGM because of its location and that it is smoke free. Usually our stays at this property have been very good. This stay was unsatisfactory due to the terrible bed. I would have rated the property higher except with all the new venues around trying to get into the parking garage has become a hassle.
40,Adjoining rooms are a bit annoying.  Side bettys grill was a huge disappointment.  Steak house was closed most of our trip.  Enjoyed seeing peoples pets at the gambling tables in strollers.  Smoke free casino was nice my throat was less haggard than last time in vegas.
40,We stayed primarily to catch the Usher show our first night. Location is GREAT with access to various parts of the strip. Eataly was a great place to eat on the go or for a quick breakfast. LaLa Noodle is a great choice for meal before a show. Casino floor was CLEAN well-lit and welcoming. Side Betty Grill was clutch for a late night snack. The pool was great as well. Other than our room being a little dirty (table hadn’t been wiped/dusted) we will consider staying here again.
50,From check in to check out all staff were very helpful and courteous. Bar prices were extremely high! ($20 + tip for Aperol Spritz). Found buying drinks on the strip were far more reasonable. Location was great. tram access to Aria and Bellagio saved a great deal of walking. Always space at the pool.
30,The stay was just ok.  The concerts create a huge mess in the casino. It is next to impossible to move through all the people to get to the room elevators.  The room had no clothes storage only a wardrobe with 4 hangers.
40,Overall this a pretty nice place! We chose to stay here this trip because we hadn't heard of it or stayed here before so figured we'd give it a shot! The casino had a wide variety of games and tables. The staff were super friendly and everything was easy to find. If you like Usher the hotel is part of the arena that hosts him and it was a banger of a concert! The restaurant selection is fairly nice also and the convenient store is in-depth and had everything we needed.    The only drawbacks that I saw was there wasnt a dresser just a 4 tier cubby deal in the closet. I like to unpack when I get somewhere. Also the room we had was smaller and the layout was weird. Our bed was against the bathroom wall and the TV was to the right of the bed hanging on the wall. They had it attached to a movable frame just inconvenient. Finally I asked twice when making the reservation for the hotel and pool cabana for there to be champagne and OJ for mimosas and my birthday. Unfortunately that didn't happen either time.    The drawbacks are minor inconveniences and mostly had to do with my preferences.
50,i stayed at the Park MGM when I went to see USHER at the Dolby Live. I love staying at the Park MGM because it has a great location comfortable rooms reasonable price great service and the Dolby Live is conveniently located within the complex. I would recommend the Park MGM to others and plan to go back again in the future for shows or just for a visit to Las Vegas.
10,The room we booked was not available because they overbooked the hotel. The room we were given was dirty and smelled like marjuana. We were moved to another room that was also dirty and not what we booked.
40,Did not get the room types (strip view) I had originally reserved so that was a bit disappointing … had dine at Momofuku (Cosmopolitian) but MGM Rewards program was not accepted (so wasn’t able to get the points) … overall nice hotel for the value
30,Make sure to check all bedding before sleeping. We found blood stains on the bedspread and ear wax on the other bedspread. The front desk sent housekeeping right away and everything was fixed. Just check before unpacking!!
40,Easy property to get around right in the middle of the other MGM properties. Trams made it easy to get around on the strip in A/C. We had a good time. The rooms were very cumfortable but not spectacular or I would have scored this propety higher.
50,The overall experience and stay at the MGM was phenomenal for me my Georgian cousins Aunties and new sista-friends! We enjoyed the concert and topped it off at his club inside MGM On The Record! Snapped photos in front of the Confession Booth and a couple with singer Tevin Campbell. “Good Vibes Only”
40,We throughly enjoyed going to the non-smoking casino. It made it a more pleasant experience. The staff were friendly and extremely helpful. Having an adult only pool area was also nice although all pool areas were nice and clean.
50,We did a girls trip with our 16 year old daughters and loved that it’s located across the street from T-Mobile arena! Very convenient you can literally walk if you have an event there . Hotel is Smoke free too !
50,Simple elegance nice stay. Very centrally located to so many things. The check in and out was simple. Friendly staff. Overall great value. Just loved how conveniently located the property is to the stadium and t-mobile arena
50,The stay I recently had was top notch. It is so awesome to be in a smoke free environment while gaming and dining. The newly renovated rooms are just lovely with the nice couch in front of the windows.
50,Love this place Great staff at the front desk but man let me tell you the people running the table games are awesome. Love that it is NON SMOKING!!! Great food choices and wine selection. Great casino floor easy to navigate.
30,Hotel like all in Las Vegas is hugh and feel luxurious as part of the MGM group  However this one is mid tier- is not luxurious as compared to where I stayed in Asia. - Macau  What is good  Location :) I. Hot hot 43 degrees Celsius Las Vegas. The deuce bus stop is right in front of the hotel  The escalator to cross the strip the monorail taking you to Bellagio is also at my doorstep  Avis book a car is in the hotel.  Heaps of eateries too..  Service is great. As I have to take Chinese medication. I need hot water. ( note tt hotel in Vegas does not provide water at all )  Staff actually provide me with a kettle and hard pillows on request. The safe was locked and they come immediately to fix it.  BEST ! They actually have housekeeping daily. None in Camelot inn ( earlier review)  Would I recommend this place . Yes can stay!
50,Wow what can I say the location was fantastic. The hotel was super clean. Smoke free residence. Attached to Dolby Live Theater. Amazing food available. Service was spectacular. Easy walking access to New York New York and Aria.
50,MGM properties are amazing and deserve everyone’s business. Regardless if it’s business or pleasure you will be well taken care of and most importantly you will have a blast. So book your stay today….
50,Highly unusual for us to have two vacations in one year especially to the same place but after our stay in July we had to go back. We would gladly keep returning after having such an amazing staff I don't have one bad word - staff location restaurants pool rooms etc etc are truly enjoyable.
30,I liked the restaurants in the hotel but our actual room wasn’t great. It was a long walk down the hallway there was no refrigerator and there was a large puddle of water in the hallway that was so large you couldn’t walk around it and we had to walk through it.  We stayed with a group and the desk wasn’t helpful when I asked to get access to another floor that our group was staying on so every time we wanted to visit their room they had to meet us at the elevators.    I didn’t feel like I got much value for the amount I was spending.
50,I love the smoke free casino since I don’t smoke it was so clean. Good Italian food! It is a small casino compared to most. But not having smoke in my face when I am gambling is a huge plus. I wish there were more options for eating after midnight.
40,Perfect location. Visited when it was extremely hot but didn't need to venture outside very often as property is connected to The Crystal Shops The Aria and the tram to Bellagio. Would stay again and would recommend to others
30,We go to Vegas for the pools and the Park has a good pool area. You can find shade without paying for a premium chair unlike other hotels we have tried in Vegas.  If you pay extra for a Strip view you can sit in the window seat in your room and people watch. Which I highly recommend that you do. We have stayed here multiple times in the past years and have had no complaints.  However we have stayed at the Park three times in the last 15 months and at each stay the last day that housekeeping comes in they short us towels toilet paper and do not replenish shampoo. Since it happened at each of our last 3 visits it must be the norm for them. You can call housekeeping to get the missing items and tip whoever brings the items to you of course. At our last visit we got back to the room to late to call so I went home with dirty hair. Are they worried we might take toilet paper or towels home? It is a pretty big inconvenience and I think that it is time to check out other hotels to stay in.
50,Everyone I engaged with was really friendly and helpful. The facility was clean smelled fresh and non smoking which was a huge plus. Rooms were awesome. Nice and quiet clean and had everything I needed during my stay.
30,If you suffer from kidney disease and having supplies shipped here for dialysis you might want to read this. The staff does not know how to handle your precious packages. My other half and I went to the bell desk and they werent able to locate the medications. Not only that they will try to charge you almost $50+ just to get your supplies. Just inquiring to the bell staff leaves a sour taste in your mouth and will make you soo exhausted. The staff could be more helpful and needs to be more happy and cheerful.
50,Nice clean friendly comparing other mgm property. No smoking in Casino and Hotel is the plus++++ . Convenience location access to other properties specially with the tramp to get around. I would stay here again
10,people smoke inside their rooms it smells like weed in the halls hotel room is dirty and don’t bother paying for shipment if you’re lucky to have an item you forgot found. I lost my AirPods and they swapped them for old disgusting ones
50,Good place to stay and play plus it’s a smoke free facility which is convenient if you have kids traveling with you. Accessibility is not an issue and we can quickly navigate in and around the Las Vegas strip.
40,Overpriced. Resort Fee on top of regular daily night. Non-smoking smells great! Taxes over fees and fees over taxes. Had to ask for a fridge. No support or guidance for 1st timers in Vegas we had to figure out RTC trams etc. Other than that people leave you alone friendly staff quick resolution to any concerns. Clean! By far the nicest places to eat in many of the resorts. Food was delicious. Deuce bus stop right in front of the hotel. Free Trams available to take you to other adjecent resorts. Very dark hotel hallways. Get the $50 food credit at booking well worth it. Denny’s $8.99 breakfast in front of the hotel!
50,Staff was great hotel room was super clean! And housekeeping staff was beyond sweet!  The casino staff were great as well!  Enjoyed the extra towels we got and accommodated our baby really nice. It was a great experience over all!
10,Not planning on coming back. My engagement (diamond) ring was stolen from the room. I filed for an incident report with the hotel security but was just told to wait while they “investigate”. Asked for the log of in’s and out’s to the room while we were away to see if anyone else came into the room. They said they have to look through their database which takes 1-2 weeks? Not to mention the room was dirty with leftover items from previous guests. While I was filing the report in the front desk had another group of guests barging into the associate I was talking to to cancel their reservation because the room they were booked with were not at all cleaned (mentioned something about dirty diapers and not being able to open the door because of all the mess left from previous guest). I had to wait until the guests were done with yelling to continue with my incident report of missing ring.
40,Clean rooms and casino is smoke free for those wishing not to be around smoke. A few places to eat that are reasonably priced. Smaller than a lot of casinos but still a nice clean place to stay. Comfy beds
20,Hotel rooms hallways are dark dingy and not inviting. Rooms have terrible decor of blood red or muted green walls. Thin walls you could hear the other rooms conversations very clearly. Staff was nice.
40,We didn't stay here but we did play table games here because it's smaller buy ins than some of the bigger resorts on the strip. Nice casino especially because it's smoke free. We had Nang and Joe on 3 card poker and they were amazing dealers. They were very interactive and it makes the table so much fun. Everyone had a blast when they were dealing!!! Very professional and it's nice when the dealers have fun with the players. Makes for a great experience. The casino is on the smaller side and not a lot of restaurant options but all in all it's a pretty good little spot. It's attached to the Aria just a few min walk which is nice.
40,This is not a luxury hotel like some of the others in Vegas. It is cute clean and has loads of amenities and very conveniently located for events (work) at the MGM Grand.  If you are not coming for the 'luxury' of a Vegas room this is a great place.
40,Stayed here for 3 comped nights - the app digital check in and key were great. The room was nice clean and roomy not too far from the elevator. As many have said there was no coffee/hot water machine and no refrigerator. The ice machine was near the elevator but not having a coffeemaker in the morning was inconvenient - getting ready to go downstairs to Starbucks instead of being able to leisurely wake up get ready and drink coffee/tea before going out for the day.    There was also a bit of noise we could hear from the room next door. The kids in the room were screaming quite a bit and we could hear them enough to disturb our sleep but we were so tired it didn't really matter.    The smoke-free casino is refreshing compared to all of the smoke allowed casinos and we loved having Eataly as the main dining venue with all of its options while there - something for everyone. Being able to book Mad Apple at the New York New York Hotel thru the app was easy and free parking (as an MGM guest) at other MGM properties was a plus.    Overall Park MGM is a great place to stay.
50,This is a really nice modern looking hotel. Very clean and welcoming. Checking in and out was superb and easy. The only thing was that we tried to have more tieeks delivered and noome answered the phone and on our second day out room was never serviced. I understand because of the pandemic some services may not be 100%. But overall it was great.
50,I wish the hotel had shuttles to different areas. I liked the quick taxi service. The food at the hotel was not that great for the price. The hotel need some more food choices for kids or maybe some smaller portions
30,I have been into Park MGM before and always thought it was a cool thing place and thought it was a good place to stay. I was sadly disappointed because the rooms were not great the ceiling was really low and it was very dark in the halls! One night was complementary and the other I had to pay. I was disappointed! I’m not sure I’ll stay there again!
50,A stay at Park MGM is unlike any other stay because of the central location to the Dolby theater and T-Mobile Arena. Eatly offers fine italian eats on a modest budget Best Friend is great place chill with current or make new friends and La Noodle is an under-rated dining experience.
30,I booked a Stay Well room but the mattresses were worn out and the air conditioner did not work. I was moved to a non Stay Well room and it was so much better! Also I did not care for the red color everywhere in the Stay Well room (couch walls etc). The non Stay Well room was green which was somewhat better.
50,The property is very nice. People are great and the food choices offered at Eataly are great. The pool is very nice. The fact that the Park MGM is non smoking is a plus. We usually drive but did not this time and the convenience of having an avis rental car desk there was very nice.
50,This hotel is beautiful! I never stayed at the Monte Carlo when it around but now that it’s Park MGM- I’m glad I got to experience the updated decor.  Hotel staff was friendly checking into hotel was a breeze; I used the mobile check-in just for my own convenience since my flight came in at roughly 11:30pm.  The pool bar was pretty chill the bartenders really knew how to interact with the crowd and the drinks were good!  Over all I will definitely stay here again
50,Great room and location. A short distance from shopping and plenty of food options. Staff was so kind and helpful. Casino being smoke free was a definite plus. You will be very happy here. Primrose is a must.
10,Some girl tried to rob me and they let her go and arrested me of course charges were made up and dropped will be contacting my lawyer so you guys can expect to hear from him soon  how can you guys not protect your guests?
20,The 9th floor is very filthy. The carpet is severely stained walking down the hall. It’s poorly lit. My room had only one cup and it wasn’t clean. The hotel did not offer a refrigerator nor microwave. Try como or plant.
10,My reservation has been upgraded from another hotel. Despite this I paid the resort fee and the parking fee at the exit. Total $124.44 . I have already paid these fees. There is never an additional charge for an upgraded room. My profession is hotel management. The differences are between the two hotels. The guest cannot be held responsible for this. Although I explained this to the reception they were not interested. In addition the room we stayed in did not have any bathtub or shower cabin in the bathroom. The washing part was covered with a curtain. Disabled room was given to us.
50,Overall the hotel is great- old rooms and a weird smell in hallways and elevator but I think it’s because it is older. Enjoyed our stay and have stayed several times in the past. It’s nice that is connected to Aria and a short tram ride to the Bellagio.
50,Amanda B. employee #545358 was a huge help in making my daughters first trip to Vegas one she will always remember. She was absolutely great and showed genuine concern to make sure everyone she talked to had the best trip possible.
50,Had a mother daughter trip to see Usher in concert. we stayed on the property and that was the best idea. The pool area was nice as well. The staff was pretty accommodating and the staff at the Dolby Center were great as well.
20,I paid for park with room. It never worked. Card did not allow me out of garage. Back up traffic. Had to call hotel to fix. App was a joke and did not allow me to check in and avoid the lines. Really nice property. Great location. These issues had a big impact on my overall evaluation of the property.
20,1. I was so excited I became a rewards member so I could enjoy what I read all about the MGM experience. Only to be disappointed. This was suppose to a smoke-free environment. And for me not being a smoker this was very appealing for me. But I get to my room to find NOT only was my room smokey  2. I reserved a King room with a Vegas strip view. And I got a double beds with bad mattresses (I felt like I was going to fall out the bed) the only thing I could see of the Vegas strip was the Walgreens.  3. The room was so dirty it was dust literary everywhere in the room (from the vents to the door-handles). Even the toilet lever was upside down (I have the pictures to show).
50,stayed at Espinas Hotel for six nights and enjoyed it very much for several reasons.  The staff are really friendly Mr. Motahari who always try to help in any way possible and be responsive.  The room cleaning done by Mrs. Ghanbari is excellent and most of the staff can speak English.  If you want to visit the city's attractions the location of the hotel is ideal.
40,I booked this newer location primarily because it was connected to the Dolby Live and I saw Usher there. I also booked because it is the entirely non-smoking facility on The Strip. Unfortunately the people in the room next to mine either smoked/vaped marijuana and the smell was strong. I did report this I was told someone would address it. It does not seem that was the case because the behavior continued. The mattress was not the most comfortable. Other than those things I did enjoy my stay.
10,They accidentally checked me out of my room and when the issue was resolved and we were able to access our room they had given access to another guest and they were in our room while we were out of our room
10,Checked in to a dirty room. Took nearly 2 days to have it addressed. Housekeepers on our floor were terrible. Security must have been on breaks as the amount of transients coming begging for money throughout the casino was uncomfortable.
50,My husband and I celebrated our 30th wedding anniversary in August and took advantage of a 3 night comped hotel stay offer from MGM Rewards and stayed at the Park MGM from August 28th to August 31st. Also included in the offer was $10 in Free Play and a $50 food and beverage credit.  This was our second stay at the Park MGM (our first was in 2019) and had a great stay once again. Our king room was spotless no issues with housekeeping and we love that it is a non-smoking hotel.  The location is great and the free tram to the Aria and Bellagio is very handy and we used it several times as the temperature while we were there was over 100 degrees every day.  Overall we didn't win in the casino but had fun! We ate at Best Friend and had pizza at Eataly and highly recommend both. Corey at Best Friend was very helpful in explaining the menu and guiding us in our choices (street corn short rib tacos deep fried eggplant kimchi mac and cheese were all highlights). We also ordered the bbq chicken wings but were so full we had to get those to take out at the end of the meal. We used a MyVegas reward for a comped starter and they ended up taking the value of the comp ($16.00) off our bill.  We also had a MyVegas 2 for 1 specialty drink offer at Juniper bar in Park MGM. I had a daquiri and my husband had a gin based drink and both were wonderfully prepared and presented. They were quite strong...good thing we didn't have far to walk to get to our room as after a day of day drinking those drinks put us over the top!  All staff that we interacted with were friendly and helpful. We'll definitely stay at the Park MGM again!
50,Our annual sister trip was better than ever this year because we stayed at Park MGM for the first time. Loved the smoke-free casino and our room/bed/pillows were super comfy! Some of the best coffee I've ever had every morning in EATaly!
30,If you stay at the Park MGM expect to to have ZERO cell service in your room! I went for my birthday weekend & had no way of contacting any family while in the room! Not to mention their wifi wasn’t all that great either!
50,The Park MGM has a central strip location the pools are good (especially for adults) and the rooms get the job done. The room I had was right by the elevator but for that reason was bigger than the others. It was spacious and clean but I wouldn't put the room quality up there with their neighbors (Aria Cosmo Vdara). It was fine for my purpose.
40,Park MGM is in prime location and overall a great resort! However some amenities needs to be addressed mainly A/C as my first room assigned the AC was earning as it wasn't cooling and would kick on and off and turn eventually shut off! I was moved to znother room that A/C was better but not cooling effectively. I ask front desk for a fan and was told that the facility did not have fans! However when in my room on the second day and housekeeping came in Sophia and commented on warmth of room I explained about my first room and also that I had asked for a fan and was told fans weren't available she immediately replied they were and called her supervisor  Suri and she brought a fan up in minutes! Excellent customer service by Sophia and Suri! Also I spoke to Gauge in Guest Services and he was exc8and provided outstanding customer service!!
30,no one could direct you to anything on the property. Only good service came from the wonderful staff at the Bell Desk. Primrose is excellent restaurant  staff included. A little pricy but excellent food. Wish they had been open for evening dining.
50,My husband and I love staying at Park MGM since it’s the only non-smoking hotel & casino on the strip. It’s simple comfortable affordable & just amazing!! The food the casino & the service are all of what we’re looking for in a vacation! We love it & we would definitely return AGAIN!
50,My husband and I were originally booked to stay in Paris Las Vegas however due to the abysmal reviews we decided to switch last minute to the Park MGM.    Pros:  The room was a good size lovely bathroom with a great shower.  Possibly the most comfortable bed ever!  Good sized pool area which never felt over crowded or chaotic.  Hotel not too big so going too and from your room isn't a mission.  City centre monorail station on site.    Cons    Twice we had to send the maid away as it was 8:30am and one of us was in the bathroom. Mind sad she would come back she never did. Room went 2 days without being serviced. When I called to ask for the room to be cleaned I was told it was my own fault for sending the maid away. If my husband is in the shower what am I supposed to do?? I didn't appreciate being spoken to like I was by housekeeping or being blamed for 'missing my slot'. Never known this to happen in any other hotel I've stayed in before.    Pool towels are thin small and a bit rough    I would definitely recommend this hotel and would happily stay there again.
50,Smoke free casino great food choices  great employees  great location and good night sleep. The casino is walking distance to just about anywhere we like to go. It has Eataly in the lobby we love La La Noodle if you want to try different foods there’s a walkway to Aria and Tram to Cosmo and Bellagio.
40,Stayed on 28th floor room 313. Overlooks Las Vegas Blvd stores Ross Target etc. The room has two queen beds sofa and table and chair. Beds were comfy but def low (think modern). It was roomy and had all the usual. The only reason I didn’t give it a 5 is there is no fridge which I knew before I booked but really wished to keep my water cold and the lights - you can easily turn on the light by the door the other lights are there but you have to walk a ways to get to them and then figure out how to turn them on.. no biggie once you do it. The shower had good water pressure. Best thing was the NO smoking policy! Loved that!
30,The guest floor carpet soiled and housekeeping lacking. Returned to room with some trash still left and sink not cleaned. There was also a towel provided that had dried blood on it. We used glasses but days later they were left uncleaned.
30,If it was not a comp room I’d prob of chosen Luxor the rooms need fridges only thing that was good was it was non smoking the pool closes early so it’s a bummer Maybd Vegas isn’t back to pre pandemic level
40,The property is in a great location and is definitely an upgrade from the old Monte Carlo Casino. The lobby and casino floor are amazing and so is Eataly. The hallways and rooms could use some updates.
50,The entire hotel is non-smoking which I found to be a bonus. There is a tram that takes you between Aria/ Crystals mall and Bellagio that makes this location very accessible.    The rooms were clean (housekeeping didn't throw out the trash can from previous guests but it wasn't a big deal - just some water bottles) and spacious. I liked that our room had a sofa and decent table to eat any room service we ordered. The bed was a medium level of softness and there were 2 types of pillows. You could hear people through the walls if they were yelling but otherwise it seems like the typical guests here are on the quieter side. For my first time here I was pleasantly surprised and will probably be back soon.
50,Excellent location you can walk to Aria without ever having to go outside it is very close. If you are in a wheelchair or mobility you will have to briefly go outside to get the elevator to access the walkway to the Aria Hotel. Very close to The Park and New York New York that has many great restaurants and less expensive restaurants.    The rooms were spacious and the showers were exceptional with great water pressure and the shower is very large. There could be more drawer space.    The VIP check-in unfortunately was anything but VIP long lines and no bottled water offered like other VIP check-in locations at other MGM Rewards properties. Always we can get a room immediately with our Gold status but had to wait two hours with a promised upgrade to a higher floor with a great view turned out to be a mid-floor with a so so view. Also MGM properties will no longer allow scooters to be dropped off from outside companies to the bell desk causing us to wait hours in the lobby for it to arrive. No special treatment for a very special birthday trip.    We did however love this hotel despite the check-in process and other drawbacks. We absolutely love the location and we will stay here again.
50,Good value central on the Strip and all non-smoking. Pleasant staff and nice pool area. Side Bettys cafe is a great place to get a snack.  We have stayed here for 25 yeas even back to when it was Monte Carlo.
50,First time even entering this casino and 10 out of 10 recommended it’s 100% non smoking you walk in and you get a rush or pure clean air. Staff very helpful even to first time craps player as my self.
50,The venue for the concert was great. Not a bad seat in the house. The service in all aspects of the hotel was great. The fact that it is a non smoking hotel was a plus. That made gambling in the casino enjoyable.
40,I was happy with my stay I just felt the accommodations were dated so now I have continue writing to meet the word count for this survey which I feel is a bit annoying as well because I really stated my thoughts already
20,The hotel check in process was horrendous. After flying four hours we had to wait an hour to check in. When we got to the check in desk the clerk Cesar was every rude and downgraded our room without our permission. He never explained that our reserved room would not be available but instead just told us he was downgrading us. After I got to my room I received a text alert that he had charged my AMEX card over $3000. So instead of enjoying my trip and sleeping in I have to wake up early and inquire about these charges. I would say to avoid this hotel but if you do then please look at your credit card after checking in.
50,The staff was GREAT !!! The eateries were plentiful !! You must visit Bevette( Steakhouse) in the hotel !! Primrose and Side Betty were also great places to eat !! The pool area and the staff were great . The bar area was bar none .
30,Stayed at Park MGM for five days four nights and the staff was very friendly and courteous. Although I enjoyed my stay there were a few things that was missing. First there was no refrigerator or microwave in the room however you can request a fridge for $50. The bed was a big low and very soft and woke up not rested at all. There is only one night stand for a double room so we had shared the space. Also there isn't much counter space in the bathroom and bathroom as well. It was a good thing we order the fridge and was able to use the top to place our items.    The restaurant for breakfast was good as the omelets and potatoes were fresh and tasty but which there were more selection in restaurants as there was only one. There were other options for lunch and dinner which was good. Liked the fact that the Dolby Live was inside the hotel so didn't have to go too far for the concerts. I also like tram to the Bellagio that was within the hotel and didn't have to go too far. Would stay again however for a short stay if the items above are not available.
20,Rooms are tiny with zero amenities; no water refrigerator coffee or maker poor quality soap lotion TP. you name it and it's cheap.  Our TV constantly buffered and the phone never worked so room service was impossible.  No decent places to eat breakfast or even sit down for a coffee. oy Starbucks and underwhelming Eatily. Yuk! so plan on going elsewhere to eat every meal. Bavette's is decent for dinner if you can get a reservation otherwise forget about it!
50,Excellent reward program for play. Complimentary rooms free play & food money. Downside is restaurants are very expensive. Location is awesome to many other casinos. Eataly which has many eating choices with food from Italy.
50,Nice room No refrigerator  Bed is so comfy I wish I could of taken it with me  Very quiet if you are looking for peace  Housekeeping could be better with cleaning I wiped the room down with Clorox bleach wipe before I unpacked
40,First time visit to Las Vegas for my birthday. Hotel/Casino was smokeless which was great. Food options were excellent and hotel was in a great location. Staff was courteous but not overly nice. Would recommend.
50,We like to travel to Las Vegas for the weather (we live in cloudy Seattle). It is an extra plus for us to stay at a nonsmoking casino/hotel with reasonable room prices and a top set of restaurants like La La Noodle Primrose and Bavett's Steakhouse.
40,Improved updates since the rebranding are above average but the guest rooms could use some more work. Overall accommodations were okay. I’d stay again. Air conditioner wasn’t very cold but did cool the room. Attempt was made to improve the air flow but did not work. I appreciate the effort to accommodate us.
30,Gaming trip. Just get out of town. Played and enjoyed. Did have a good time. See you guys in oct. Wish I get free rooms and more food credit. The points I get back doesn't compare to amount of tip I give. Probably tip less because no benefit in my rewards.
50,My wife and I have been fans of Park MGM since seeing a show at their Dolby Theatre earlier this year. We didn’t realize how much of a difference a smoke free casino and hotel makes before that. So we switched from our traditional Caesars property stays to Park MGM this trip. The room was clean and well maintained with a spacious bathroom and comfortable bed. We were able to upgrade to a suite for a very reasonable price during the slower earlier part of the week and found the staff to be very accommodating. Going back to Las Vegas later this month and look forward to staying at Park MGM again.
50,We will be back in December to catch another concert or two!! It was A Perfect weekend getaway for us!! Park MGM is Centrally located close to T-mobile arena and MGM Dolby live...The Nomad is nice as well and learn it occupies the top 4 floors of the Park MGM....It was not over crowded like most other Casino's. We loved it!
10,Unhelpful staff. Rude. Hard time enjoying room or stay when there's so much harassment. Rewards members where not as helpful to a reward member as I am. Will not be staying there ever again. It's ashamed
40,Smoke free and very nice choices of restaurants ( casual or dressy) very friendly nice helpful and courteous staff. Good selections of slot machines etc. Nice location and easy access with plenty of available parking spaces.
50,My wife and I were able to go down to Las Vegas and stay at the Park MGM. Dinner at Gallagher's was exceptional. The Park MGM is a very clean non smoking hotel and casino with great ambiance. The only non-smoking casino on Las Vegas blvd.
50,MGM Park was clean and fresh with an entirely smoke free atmosphere. Immediately greeted and directed to the VIP Check in no waiting! We had booked a standard room but check-in staff Daniel and Andrea let us know a spacious corner room (Nighthawk Suite) was available. We are so glad we went for that room- the shower was huge!  We went to Eataly and as we were looking at the variety a friendly security guard named Hank offered some very helpful tips! He knew a lot about wine and all about Happy Hour. We were able to get exactly the types of food and wine from the different areas and eat where we liked  In the middle of the casino is the big circular west bar. Scott and Vavi kept the drinks coming it was a busy bar but we were well taken care of. MGM Park is my new favorite place to stay and play. The fact that the entire property is non-smoking is icing on the cake.
50,Compared to the other lower cost MGM properties this is a far cleaner and newer than most. Its at a good location walking distant to other properties and near the Tram to go farther if needed. Would stay again.
10,Very dirty and outdated . We switched 3 rooms and all were very dirty ended up cleaning it ourselves. There was hair and mold in the shower  hair in the sink dust all over . Stay away from this hotel.
50,Easy to use mgm app & digital key. Clean and updated rooms staff is helpful and friendly great place to stay for family fun partying gambling relaxation stores in walking distance good location
40,Very nice hotel. Had a good size pool with plenty of lounge chairs. Restaurant choices were also really good. We are at three different locations and all were very good. Best friends was outstanding. Really like the free team that takes you to the bellagio. Resort is very impressive and we liked that it was a nonsmoking casino.
50,If you go to Las Vegas stay at the Park MGM it is a non smoking hotel including the casino. For me the mattress in the room was too soft. Hallway was to dimly lit for those travelling by themselves. Good selection of resturants. If you are a starbucks lover they have one that you can order ahead.
10,The room was small smelly and dated. I thought I was getting a deal when I saw the cheap price considering this was an MGM property. The room give you the feel of a cheap motel with red or green painted walls. It was absolutely HORID
50,Very clean and the room was cute and we asked for a room that was handicap accessible when booking the room and we actually got one which was nice. often times I ask for it during booking and then never actually give me one from other hotels. All of the workers were so friendly.
30,The rooms theme are red or green..The hallways are dark and depressing. I made the mistake of staying here after 3 nights in Aria because it was where the Usher concert was held.I would’ve thought MGM Park was going to be nice. I was wrong.
30,Rooms are small. Shower has no water pressure. Walls are VERY thin. Liked that the casino was smoke free. Casino is very clean. Location was okay. I like to be further down the strip. Pool was very clean.
40,The casino and restaurants are great. The nonsmoking property is a huge plus. The guest rooms are just ok. They were clean but nothing special as far as a room goes.    Primrose and Eataly were very good restaurants. I will return to gamble and enjoy the bars and restaurants but I will stay at Vdara.
50,Wife and I stayed at the Park for the first time this past week not disappointed at all. From the front desk staff VIP services and room service all were awesome. The room was average size but design was great especially with window seat. View was great. I do recommend the Park MGM.
40,We booked with the ParkMGM and did enjoy our stay. The gambling experience was extremely enjoyable and the food was very good. Reasonably priced and non- smoking were a plus! We will definitely stay again!
50,Park MGM Is the place to be. It has everything you need. Great food the best entertainment spa an amazing staff. The table games slots poker and black jack are some great ways to win a few bucks. Play at your own risk especially if you’re feeling lucky.
20,The beginning of my hotel experience was great. Check in was amazing the front desk was welcoming efficient and cheerful. The ambiance was great. Room appeared to be good looking like the start of good stay. It started to go downhill when I paid $66 for a lukewarm burger chicken sandwich 2 orders of fries and 2 sodas. I understand Vegas prices that wasn't the problem. The problem was the food should be good for that price. Next issue was the room where the sheets had stains on them. In the era of covid and monkey pox cleanliness needs to be a high priority for venues as it's a high priority for the guests. last issue was the tv not working and the fire detector beeping for low battery. Once engineers attended to the remote we had television. Then after they replaced the entire detector unit we were able to go to sleep at about 2am. Not bad it's Vegas right? Unless you are on the first flight out. But all in all even though this experience was not the finest - I still like the hotel and do plan to try them out again hoping for a better experience. Like I said Park MGM has the potential because their service is great. Now just have to get the venue to match that energy.
50,Great location EATily is so fresh and delicious and easily accessible the casino is clean and has the games we love and the hotel is clean and has everything we need. A mini-fridge and/or microwave would be great though.
50,Clean hotel with nice pool and one of the best food courts in my opinion smoke free is also a plus if you dont like the smell of cigarette or cigar smoke overall i would recommended this resort anyone
40,Have stayed at many hotels across Vegas and for this price the room is ok at best. TV lacks streaming no fridge by default no water included room is fairly small and basic.    In saying all that it was very clean and the bed was comfortable. Staff were very helpful too. But I think the best thing about Park MGM is its location and easy access to almost anywhere.
20,The room smelt like a beer was spilt and never cleaned. (We do not drink the water in the sink and shower pooled and drained super slow. For the price there are so many options. They switched to an eco ac that is not refrigerant and turns off if there is not much movement on the room. At night it was so HOT apparently I don't move in my sleep enough.
50,Loved everything about this hotel. Total kid friendly and no cigarette smell at all. Loved also how staff did everything they can to accommodate your needs. Especially with toddlers it’s so difficult but they made it so easy and stress free for me
30,The rooms are average but didnt appear to be newly renovated (as described to me). The staff was great but not sure there was enough administrative help. No one to open doors or in the lobby anytime I entered. The smell of sewage in the lobby by the shop and again near the elevator shafts on the spa level should be addressed immediately.
40,other than the maid taking my apple headphones my time and stay was remarkable. it is a lot different from my stays in the Monte Carlo. the eatery is a great place to hang out and have breakfast/lunch/dinner
10,The room was dirty. Stains on the carpet. The sheets were dirty and had a blood colored stain on the them. I had to ask multiple times to have the bedding changed. And I woke up with 9+ bug bites on my legs.
40,Most of the hotel was clean loved that it was non smoking staff was great. Food was very over priced and room could have been cleaner. The shower curtain was disgusting and the carpets seemed to have not been vacuumed at all
50,We had family from all over the country meet for the Usher residency at Dolby Center. Park MGM was great to stay at and had all the the amenities we needed for a family reunion. It is also a smoke free property which was a great option for our family.
40,The room here was clean and the hotel room area was quiet. Everyone we asked for assistance was quick to help. The common hallways and rooms could use some updating but for the price it’s ok. Would consider staying again.
50,Exceptional value for last minute business trip for a Saturday night. Checkin was quick and efficient. King room overlooking pool was well equipped and plenty of room. Great shower instead of a bathtub/shower combo.
50,Great location friendly staff great food choices Italian Asian fusion noodles and much more. Rooms are fantastic!!  We love the “skylark” suite. Gaming is on point also. When we played a new card game for the first time staff went into tutor mode and made it really fun.
50,I set up a group trip for our close friends and everyone loved this hotel. Everything from the entertainment the food offerings the lounges bars and dance club the pools to the complete non smoking premise we couldn't have been more satisfied.    Another perk to staying at the Park MGM was that you could walk in any direction and you would experience another LV Strip attraction. Plus the tram to the more chic hotel/casinos was closer by.    My only complaint was that the bed in my room was not as comfortable as home. But then again not too many hotels are like a home sleeping experience. And the walls are thinner than expected. Very evident when the neighbors would use their shower or faucet.    The staff was friendly and always willing to help. So many smiles around made us feel welcomed. No hesitation to stay here again.
50,Made a trip with the family to do a live fantasy football draft. Was our first time staying at this hotel. Was one of the first casinos I have been in to where the dealers were actually friendly and would have conversation. Also the no smoking was a huge plus
30,So the Park MGM at first glance is very enticing. The casino itself is great and provides a variety of gambling selections. Food and drinks are bountiful and very easy access. The most disappointing part of this hotel is the hotel room itself. Given the price you are paying it is very lackluster. Granted the price is most likely reflecting the location of the hotel itself which is on the prime center of the strip. If location is essential for your Las Vegas trip then this place is great but personally I would pay a little extra and just stay at Aria or Vdara for a nicer living experience but also convenience of the tram transportation system. The Park MGM rooms are very small but also aesthetically poor. For a less than 5 year hotel the aesthetics and quality of the hotel room itself is very poor.
50,Excellent time spent here! Great location for concerts /shows several restaurants shops and a quick trip to center strip. Friendly staff beautiful design and spacious layout. Fun Italian marketplace atmosphere and food options. Comfortable relaxing pool with cabanas daybeds and shaded chairs. Spacious rooms with comfortable bedding. Great room lighting  bathroom vanity and excellent shower pressure. The only thing that would take the standard the room to the next level is having a fridge and microwave. Overall great place to stay
40,Loved the non smoking resort. Eataly closes very early. All the corner stores in the resort close early as well so if you stay here plan accordingly. Overall nice resort. Room temperature is not customizable
10,Bad.. everything sucked real bad. Mini bar w lasers is a scam. Can't even move without bumping lasered counter of mini bar items w bag and being charged. Parking wasn't included w room. Half to walk an hour just to get in and out of the room.
50,The room was perfect and the location was great as well. We had fun playing in the casino and we tried a few restaurants within the hotel. We will definitely stay here again. We love that they offer military discounts.
50,It was the perfect place for us on this trip. Overall nice and quiet check in on the app was our favorite! Very simple and no hassle waiting in lines for our room. Check out was the same! Valet was great!
30,Love the location and amenities however bed was extremely uncomfortable air didn’t work well tv didn’t work and neighbors could be heard. Have stayed here in past and didn’t have these issues. Hopefully next time not this bad.
30,I had a great experience here. The staff is friendly and helpful and there is plenty to do. It is near the clubs we wanted to go to as well as the shops and we got a strip view. 3 stars because our toilet wasn’t flushing and we would have liked a fridge in the room!
50,The tranquility from the hotel plus convenience and access to other hotels via tram was the main reasons I chose to stay at ParkMGM. Next I must praise for the affordability and excellent customer service. Will do it again next time!
30,We stayed at 8th floor and the carpet of the hallways were filthy. It’s dark and smelled like a mold. The room itself is ok just small and old. AC works well but you can hear the outside room nice maybe a club or something. I like the all non-smoking casino but I saw a lady smoking and nobody policed her. Eataly is great place to eat. Plenty to choose. Check in and check out is easy.
50,Really loved everything about my stay here from the moment I stepped inside. The fresh smell is nice considering it's a non smoking casino. Easy self check in had no problems and was ecstatic that I didn't have to wait in a long check in line. The pool area was great. My favorite part of the casino was to food on site though! Best Friend is a MUST for any foodie! Roy Choi is a bad man! Crack Shack may have been the best chicken sandwich I've ever had in my life! Didn't get a chance to eat in the Eataly area but the food looked great as I was walking thru. Would absolutely stay here again.
50,The check in/check out process with the app and digital key make the stay seamless. I loved the restaurant options and pool area. It was far enough that you aren’t in the eye of madness that is the Las Vegas strip. There’s a target and cvs super close. Tons to do while feeling safe especially if traveling solo
40,The place is clean but not very comfortable. The A/C was hard to gauge it was too cold or a bit warm the gym is very nice and well equipped the smell of cigarettes was a bit too much. But the location is graT since you can walk or take the tram to several other hotels around this one.
50,it has a really pretty property and smoke free casino close to aria close to nyny close to mgm grand cosmo and more. Good spot more people will enjoy it as more people experience it in then ear future
50,Enjoyed our visit- Front desk helped to put our group on the same floor. Housecleaning staff so helpful and friendly. Rooms very nice nice size with sitting area and small table and chair. Great location on the strip. Eataly restaurant in the hotel has wonderful delicious variety of foodsfor easy dining.
40,We recently stayed at the Park MGM for 5 nights. The hotel is located by the T Mobile arena in close proximity to the New York New York.  The Park MGM is smoke free including the casino. The pool restaurants and common areas are all beautiful.  The one complaint I have was the room and the fact it did not get cleaned consistently.
50,The Park is in a great location and has sone of the best restaurants. The Eately area is definitely reminiscent of Italy. The rooms are spacious and clean. The staff are very warm and inviting. It’s located at a great spot on the Strip also.
30,The halls are gloomy the carpet is dirty. The Carpet was dirty in the hallways and the rooms the shower handle leaked the shower water didn't drain and we had to stand in the dirty ponding water from whatever was causing the clog the water glasses had lip residue from whoever used them last. The room made us feel like we were staying downtown at a low-end motel with resort prices. We did a room change the next morning It appeared cleaner except the carpet was still dirty to where I kept our luggage on the table in the room because of fear of the unknown. The casino and restaurants were great though the room ruined it
50,LOVE LOVE LOVE This Hotel My Wife And I Go To Vegas About 3 Times a Year and PARK MGM Does NOT Disappoint Every Time Amazing Location SUPER CLEAN rooms Excellent Casino Atmosphere Friendly Staff Easy Access To The TRAM. Eataly Restaurants Are Delish a Def Must Visit Especially For First Timers it Will Make You Want To Come Back Over and Over AGAIN.
50,Unique to Vegas an all non-smoking hotel and casino. Would stay again. Great location with tram to Aria and Bellagio. Easy access to rooms and casino. Nice pool with plenty of room. Doesn’t have all the dining and shopping amenities found in other hotels but rooms are nice clean and easy to get to most other strip hotels.
40,The only bad thing I have to say about the Park MGM is the same thing I have to say about every resort they charge resort fees and I don’t understand why.  What does the hotel provide that would justify a fee?  When you stay at one of those hotels with an indoor water park you may expect a resort fee cause they give you unlimited access to an entire water park.  What does the casino/hotel give you?  The way way way over charge you for everything.  It’s a scam these fees.  Yes I know they all do it but that only means they are all scammers…besides the ridiculous fees it’s a nice hotel.  Good location right next to New York.
50,I had a wonderful time at the Park MGM. I love that it's possible to have a good time in a smoke free environment. Every staff person I encountered was friendly and very helpful. My room was quiet clean and the bed was comfortable. My one must do at the Park is to have breakfast and a mimosa at The Primrose.
50,Fancy comfortable rooms with the luxury pricing. Close to a majority of the other MGM properties. Monorail was awesome  As well as the trams. Alleviated from walking as much as we normally do when staying downtown
10,Room not clean properly  Shower accumulated water made a puddle.  Inside the restroom the side trim was broken.  Not enough towels  had to ask for them 2 times.  We stayed a total of four days.  The staff did not help with our concerns of the dirty room
50,Everything was ship shape in the room cans around the casino they run the casino right good selection of slots video poker and table games lala noodle was very tasty mgm rewards and  Cashiers and housekeeping were very friendly
50,I liked the place better when it was The Monte Carlo people think that everything has to up dated and new I believe it is more of a friendly place that makes the hotel that was what it use to be now everyone is running about doing their own business and and everyong has their face stuck in their phones
40,Had a billing issue and check in on my phone didn’t work so I had to wait in line for a short bit. The elevators are quite fast but my family ended up on different floors and it was difficult to get to them because we could only get off on our floor and not theirs. The staff was very friendly and VIP was great as they should be. It’s a non smoking hotel and I believe the only one on the strip so that’s a HUGE plus!
40,We didn’t know what to expect staying here but it turned out great. Loved the rooms the non smoking and the food options. We saw Silk Sonic who was performing at the Dolby Theater and it was such an amazing show
50,Great non-smoking casino. Perfect for family experience. Pool was nice casino was great for the adults close to all other nice casinos. One of the rare places in Las Vegas you can bring kids. Will return to the same casino soon!
30,This hotel is really getting bad with customer service housekeeping didn't come for two days in a row and one of those days we waited two hours for someone to come and bring towels with no explanation of why .
30,Booked here for the concert and had high expectations with the MGM brand. Dirty room inattentive staff sour taste left in my mouth. Would not stay here again regardless of how convenient it was to the event
50,Had an awesome stay at Park MGM. Staff were all so friendly room was actually very clean and spacious casino floor was beautiful and had no smoky smell and prices were very reasonable. Thank you for the amazing trip!
30,Location was great but we reserved a king room and received two queen beds instead. Rooms were pretty clean and overall we had a good stay despite it starting off rocky. Staff was professional and tried to assist as best they could.
40,If you want nonsmoking this is the hotel for you. Completely non smoking which was great. While the room was nice it could use more attention. Mold in the bathroom and stains on the couch. Room service did a great job and I love that everyone was in to-go containers.
50,We experienced an affordable wonderful stay at Park MGM. Minimally appointed room(no refrigerator) but clean and comfortable. We loved every meal we shared there. (Eataly Primrose Bavette’s Steak House). Hotel is in walking distance of major hotels on the strip.
50,Great stay. Pool was amazing. Location was close to all events we went to! Staff was super friendly. Would love to come back here again in the future. The only thing missing would be to have a Fat Tuesday inside the hotel we really enjoy those drinks
30,Everything was great.  Only suggest staff dusting the lamps .. they have. tendency to gather layers of dust AND  Have options of thinner pillows  Everything else is great. The rooms are spacious bathroom clean and tidy. I had fresh towels and housekeeping done everyday. I was on floor 3 but not noisy at all.
50,The hotel rooms were clean and the housekeeping staff were very helpful. This was my first time staying at Park MGM and it was very pleasant. I willl definitely come again. Thank you Oark MGM for a pleasant vacation.
40,"We stayed at the Park MGM to attend a Silk Sonic concert at the Park Theater. The convenience for attending events there and in the surrounding area is an added bonus. Really enjoyed that this was a smoke free hotel and casino and offered excellent and fun dining options in their ""Eataly""."
50,Very Pleasant atmosphere as well as the staff. Definitely loved the no smoking in casino. Was there with my grandson so no gambling this time. Just enjoyed the sights and the hotel. Recommend staying here for sure.
50,My husband and I had a blast at Park MGM !Park MGM was phenomenal . Totally smoke free environment . Cocktail waitresses were amazing . My husband and I felt as if we were in our second honeymoon . We can’t wait to go back !!!!
50,Excellent location spacious room and very clean.  Comfy beds the water pressure is super strong in the shower 🚿 overall really good experience would definitely stay here again and recommend it.
50,The fact that this is a non-smoking property is an awesome feature!! Pool could use a few more shade options aside from just the cabanas. Best Friends food is excellent and Eataly is super convenient. The SilkSonic show was amazing 🤩
50,What's not to love about Park MGM?  There are multiple reasonably priced food choices wonderful wine selections friendly and helpful staff. The Park is located with easy access to many other attractions. Ans of course - smoke free!!
50,Awesome time great food great staff loved The ParkMGM will definitely stay again looking forward to next year! Pool was fun service in all restaurants was impeccable! VEGAS IS MY DISNEY EORLD FO SURE!❤
50,No problems whatsoever and room was very clean. We only stayed 1 night but we played in the casino all day/night...lots of ups and downs but that is how gambling goes. But as they say whatever happens in Vegas stays in Vegas!!!
50,Great facility cleanliness non-smoking. Eataly is the best food market in Vegas. We visited everyday during our stay. The oyster special on Saturday 1-4pm was one of a kind. The table plays offered a variety of games.
50,Everything was great like always. No issues. Friendly and helpful staff. Security is always important to my family. So we are always feeling safe. Close to everything so no need to for public transportation.
50,WE absolutely loved our week at the Park. It was clean great vibes amazing food options the pool was not overcrowded service incredible.  My only small note was that the air conditioner in the rooms does not face the bed so it can get a little warm at night. But it's also the desert sooo. :) We will be back 100%!
20,Dark Hallways to Hotel rooms.Bathroom lighting terrible hard even applying makeup. Dark green dull paint on walls old outdated furniture in room. Beds too low to the floor. Outside windows where very dirty could barely view the strip. Only positive thing was no smoking.
40,Small but big enough. Drinks are good too. Super nice place. I’d go back. Only thing to make it better a poker room. That’s why the 4 stars. Nice variety of food also. Great place to stay when going for a concert!
10,Rooms were outdated. No refrigerator. Walls are paper thin and you can hear everything. Could not turn up the a/c so room was hot. Dark musty hallways to your room. Expensive for what you get. Would not recommend.
50,Went to see silk sonic and the show and hotel stay all in one…what else can one ask for. The food at Lala Noodle was very good! I will absolutely stay there again if opportunities presents….have a good day
40,Nice hotel and great pools. My only complaints were that there was no refrigerator or microwave in the room and for the cost of the room there should be. They also don’t give complimentary water bottles.
40,A few cons:  - Walls a little thin.  - Rooms a little small.  - Not much open at 12 am after a show or events attended. Had to go look outside the hotel for food options.    A few Pros:  - Love the blackout curtains.  - Water Pressure was great.  - The shower gets hot fast.  - Towels are softer than most hotels and casinos.
40,excellent location/hotel. would like to see the casino have more regular blackjack tables and more $5 or $10 tables. the non-smoking hotel/casino is fantastic. as all casino/restaurants in Vegas this one is way overpriced too. limited breakfast options solved by walking next door to NYNY.
50,We very much enjoyed our stay at the Park. We visited the hotel on our last visit and were impressed by the non smoking and we ate at Eataly. We found the room clean and well sized with a great bathroom and views of the strip. When we come back this will be the hotel we camp at for sure.
40,I had a really good time at this hotel. It was amazing main Vegas strip experience. Using the tram made it really easy to travel without having to spend all that money on taxi/Uber charges. The resort does not smell like old cigarettes like most of Vegas so that was refreshing
30,Nice exterior beautiful Eataly entrance and wonderful main lobby. As soon as you went into the dark elevator lobby it was all downhill. Cavelike halls low ceilings dark depressing colors no hall windows and stained carpet everywhere. When colors and carpeting are so dark you know something is trying to be disguised. Then the Park had the worst mattresses that I have ever ‘tried’ to sleep on. Bathroom was good but the barn door just stupid and a actual dresser instead of a few drawers in the closet would be better. If anyone was trying to get clothes out of the closet and someone else using the bathroom it was a mess. Pool areas were so so La La Noodles was really good Eataly had some pretty good options. If we ever return to see a performance at the Dolby Live we certainly would not pay as much as we did and stay at the Park MGM. A great view cannot make up for awful beds or a poorly designed room.
50,I stayed many times at the Monte Carlo it felt like a home away from home. The retained the simple hominess of the old Monte Carlo while severely upgrading the food and entertainment. We left to use the pool at Mandalay Bay one day the pool at the Park is not as nice.
50,We had a wonderful time at Park MGM. Excellent service and very clean. The rooms could use an update but we were very comfortable. The casino and restaurants on site were great! Especially Eatly where you have many choices. We would love to see some newness to the Pools also. The towels and seating had a lot of stains. Besides some updates we were provided great service and found every area to be very clean.
50,Love this place The pool the casino. The rooms. The Eataly dining area is outstanding! We will always stay there. The steakhouse is the best ! A must go. Machines seem to payout regularly which was a surprise.
20,Our view was a rooftop. The hallway to the room looked super dark and dirty. Water leak on the hallway. The bed didn’t have the right type of sheets for the mattress. Checkout was at 11:00am and by 10:20am someone was already knocking on our door.
50,We Stayed at Park MGM due to it's location across the street from T Mobile arena. While there we got to enjoy the casino & had a great dinner. Next time we return to Las Vegas for a concert this is the best place to stay.
30,Park MGM has a lot going for it. Appreciate the non-smoking environment. The casino layout is simple and much to my liking. The employees I interacted with were friendly and accommodating. My only negative is with the room. Very much so starting to show wear and tear. Especially the carpeting which was stained worn out and nasty. Other aspects of the room were very nice. Clean bathroom great product choices. Good size TV. Bed was comfortable. Lastly am not a fan at all of the mini bars and lack of mini fridges for personal use. That's a deal breaker for me and one of the main reasons my loyalty is with their competitor.
50,Awesome Place to stay. The staff is incredible and rooms are very clean and not dated like some other hotels in Vegas. I cannot say enough about the housekeeping. The casino Staff was excellent as well. We will definitely book our next trip at the Park MGM again.
10,DO not tap move or even breathe right next to the water bottle and peanuts they will charge you. Do Not use the hotel phone for urgent calls they will charge you twice. Not even for a minute of talk.
30,Currently staying at the Park MGM. Our room hasn’t been cleaned for two days. The maids come round so early that we have had to send them away as one of us has been in the shower etc. sadly that means they do not come back at all. I just called guest services and was met with a rude gentleman telling me it’s my own fault. If my husband is in the shower at 8:30am and the maid turns up what else am I to do?? My only other negative is the pool towels they are super small and very thin. Apart from the complete lack of service when it comes to room cleaning our stay at the Park MGM has been very good. The
30,We are Las Vegas locals who were hoping to stay on the strip the first time for our wedding anniversary and go to a concert at Allegiant. The room was not ready at the check-in time which drove me nuts because I wanted to be able to go there to unwind get ready for dinner and then go to the show after we stopped off at Eataly. I felt rushed and frustrated - this was not a staycation I was looking forward to based on the intro experience and honestly felt like I was just wasting money staying so close to home. We had booked a strip-view room with a king bed and checked in online through the MGM app but no room info was available. At 3:30pm I called for an anticipated check in time - there was nothing clean available they told me they couldn’t give a time but it would be “soon” and they recognized it was “way past check in time” I explained my frustration and guest services did nothing to remedy this.    Our room became available around 3:45pm. We headed over to get settled get ready grab dinner and go to Allegiant. The restaurants are awesome and we really look forward to checking out the food and bars. Eataly was a very cool experience and I can’t wait to go back. I really enjoyed NoMad Bar and Lala Noodles. I have been to the Dolby Live Theater in the past and they put on some amazing shows there!    The television did not work the second night - I called the front desk and everything was in order with the TV they wanted to send an engineer up to the room but it was after 9pm and I just wanted to relax and go to sleep.    Overall there were not a lot of amenities in the room - not really any drawers to store clothes and no refrigerator. The shower curtains were moldy and the bathroom smelled musty. The 21st floor was weirdly hot when we got off the elevator and the room was uncomfortably warm when we first arrived but the AC kicked into action eventually and the room was comfortable at a cooler temperature.    We had a fun time because we spent most of our time outside of the room (and even went home for a few hours to take care of our animals and take a quick nap). It’s a great casino with fun experiences and awesome restaurants and it was decently priced for the strip but I don’t think I would recommend a hotel stay at Park MGM to my friends or family.
40,Great choice for a modern affordable stay in Vegas. Hotel was busy but not overcrowded. Loved the food options and the layout of the hotel. The rooms were just ok but the staff is great. Good experience. Would visit again in the future.
50,My sister & I came to see Silk Sonic! Truly enjoyed the show on Thursday and the hotel and casino on Fri and Sat. We had an amazing time at Park MGM. Explore the hotel before going out because there are many great amenities. There are 3 pools and a wonderful jacuzzi. Park MGM is highly recommended.
10,Air didn’t work entire stay despite maintenance coming work on it. The bathroom was not fully cleaned. The shower curtain was moldy. Checking out the person working Vip was rude. He refused to help us even though there wasn’t anyone in line. He had just took the people in line ahead of us but refused to help us when it was our turn.
30,Had haircut at salon September’21. Went back to hotel this summer but no visit to salon this time as when I went last September in addition to an expensive haircut service charge and tip the stylist went on to pad the tip changing the amount I had filled in on check-out slip giving herself more $. Guess she thought her service was worth much more than I did even though I tip 20-25% for these services.
50,The hotel associates were very helpful throughout my visit. My friend and I shared a double room throughout the stay and really loved the amenities. Although it would have been nice if the rooms had a refrigerator or coffee maker. We purchased coffee from Starbucks every morning so that was fine!
10,First time I’ve forgotten an item in a room and had thrown away like trash. My guests $600+ dentures were thrown away. Check in was nice though and no complaints there. But to accidentally forget an item and have it thrown away is ridiculous.
50,We had a great time here. The location is great. The rooms are clean and inviting. I would definitely stay here again! Check in was super smooth and fast. Keep in mind we checked in on Sunday. Everyone was friendly.
40,location is good love the smoke free facility. lots of places to eat. pool was great clean. staff was friendly. we stay here often. easy hotel to get around in. Close to airport. close to football stadium and hockey arena.
40,bed was rough and uncomfortable. room did not smell well. no bath tub. pillows were great tho. staff were nice but no one went up and beyond. when i requested extra towels they were still damp. the maid apologized since they were wet but that was not acceptable.
30,Very convenient hotel if you have a venue at the T-Mobile just cross the street..smoke free is a big plus lots of options for lunch and dinner…restrooms are kept up very well down fall was they had no more Stella beer..on tap
50,Great venue excellent location and non-smoking hotel and casino.. staff members are incredibly nice and very accommodating. Don’t forget to ask for an upgrade to a suite… The standard rooms are very small. My wife and I were there for the silk sonic concert which is connected to the PARK MGM. So you cannot beat the convenience - leaving your room and going straight into the concert venue without having to go outside.
30,Rooms need to be cleaned better. Lots of dirt and dust. Must do fast clean. Ventilation needs help. It was so hot and muggy in elevators and hallways to the rooms. Had to turn the fan all the way up and air all the way down to get room to cool down.
50,me and my friend had a trip and our stay at the park mgm was great absolutely fantastic and we really enjoyed the rooms and the amazing service as well the food that was available was also fantastic and the response time that we got when we had a problem was fast and outstanding
20,"Currently here - for another 4 days still to go. There is no dresser. 4 tiny drawers in the ""closet"" No coffee maker. No fridge/microwave...usually even a bargain hotel has one of those. No desk to work at just a tiny table in the corner that if you're working on you can't eat at. You can hear people opening and closing doors and walking about the hallways loudly.    The food was good and the pool area is really nice. But I am here for a working trip and this just isn't the best place to suit our needs."
40,I’ve been to many Hotels This Small size MGM (park mgm) was astonishing The Dolby Live Center a whole experience of Amazement Silk Sonic Experience (residency was so personable they made me feel like I was apart of their Family! I’ll be Back!
50,Execellent experience at the Park MGM - the cost is perfect and it's an elegant vibe. There were so many great food options to choose from. There was a bit of a sewage smell on the casino floor but other than that we loved our hotel stay.
20,we stayed here for 3 nights and did not enjoy it at all.  The rooms are very cheaply remodeled with a barn style door that slides in front of the bathroom and closet. If someone is in the bathroom stay away from the closet or you’ll get hit really hard.  Decor looks like it was supplied by IKEA. You will hear your neighbors opening and closing their blinds as if they’re in your room even at 2-3 am. The A/C must have been from the old Monte Carlo casino and the thermostat is nonfunctional. You’ll be cold one second and warm the next. We did not get even one restful night’s sleep.  There was construction on our floor (13th) with the wallpapers stripped and an industrial fan blowing on the hallway. I’m not sure if it was to dry up mold or what!!??? This was not disclosed at check in.  Pool chairs are old and seats sagging down to the ground very uncomfortable.  Resort fee if $39 plus $5.50 “resort fee tax” per night. I’m not sure why they feel they can charge that much given the state of this property.  We will not be back.
50,Top notch service great food doesn't feel big but still personable. Smoke Free is such a weird quirk it took me a while to realize why the Casino floor felt different...and it does! And you gotta catch a show at the Dolby Live. No bad seats in the house.
20,My girlfriends and I went for a going away trip and 50th bday celebration. We were offered an upgrade to a suite and feel like we got scammed. It wasn't worth the money because the room was clearly missing furniture and accessories (think worst bachelor pad ever!). Other than the location being near our concert - we won't stay here again. Too bad bc the restaurants were good and offered nice food choices. We also loved the speakeasy Off the Record.
10,Make sure you ensure your room isnt under construction befoee you check it. They failed to tell me when I checked in and that rhere was plumming issues which caused me to be relocated from my party. I will never stay at this hotel again since the manager never followed up with my concerns. Dont put a person in a room thats under construction.
20,To celebrate my 48th birthday. My husband bought VIP seats for Silk Sonic. Our host was very pleasant and attentive. She helped to make our Silksonic experience great. The show was amazing ! It’s right up there with Beyoncé. That was the best part of our trip.
30,I upgraded to a suite thinking it would be a better “Vegas” experience. Bed was so hard - like sleeping on concrete. I guess if you have enough drinks it’s all good? Blood red toilet area was disturbing.
50,Non smoking environment throughout entire building. Great food drinks and entertainment all under 1 roof! No need to go outside. Enjoyed our entire stay!!!! Concerts are also downstairs from room. Awesome.
20,Overpriced. Air conditioning doesn’t work.No information whatsoever was given regarding rewards program. I wouldn’t recommend this to anyone. There’s nicer places for much less price. Not staying again
10,King bed was tiny. Shower didn’t drain properly. We asked the front desk for an upgrade. They said no and sent someone to unclog the shower. We only stayed one night so I didn’t fight. But the room was trash.
50,Very clean and enjoyed the smoke free environment. Safe and convenient to almost everything. Plenty of choices for restaurants bars and shopping. Eataly has some great food choices.  Pillows were soft but put 2 together and they were fine.
40,Great property in an excellent location. Enjoyed Silk Sonic concert and great meals at Best Friends and Bavettes. Would def stay again—rooms could be a little larger and bathrooms updated but it is a great value.
40,+Location on property amenities service. First time staying at the Park MGM. Really appreciate the smoke free environment. The tram to/from Aria and Bellagio was efficient and save one from walking in the heat  -Bathroom sink drain was slow to drain; no fridge in room
50,I loved my stay here. I love how conveniently located all the restaurants and stadium are. Definitely recommend this hotel if you are going to a concert at the Dolby live or T-Mobile arena. The rooms are really clean and cozy. I suggest going to Primrose for breakfast/brunch!
20,Rooms reeked of a smoke or maybe just extremely old building smell and AC didn’t get colder than the original setting. Eately was great and staff was friendly but I will be at a different property on my next trip for sure.
20,The room was not fixed on the first day of our stay even though I told the housekeeper to fix it when I saw her in the hallway. The second day housekeeper just fixed beds and change towels but not cleaned commode. The room was on a floor that you can hear loud music from outside.
50,This is my 4th or 5th stay it’s always a great place to be. Perfect location friendly staff clean casino smoke free it’s the place to be. The resort is walkable to most other casinos and you are only a short drive to further destinations.
40,Had a good stay here. I have stayed at other MGM properties and this ranks closer to the top than expected. Location is great (It’s interior attached to Aria) and staff is friendly. Wish the vanity was a bit bigger but the shower is a good size. Will be back in the future!
50,Great place. Smoke free. Kid friendly. Next time I'll definitely bring my kids. The location is great being in the center of the strip right across from New York New York. I highly recommend this place to stay while in Vegas!
50,Came here for 4 nights while working in town. Stayed in the Nighthawk Suite. Nice room with large bathroom. Close to elevators. Very good fitnes center right off the elevator on floor 2. Smoke free hotel. Friendly staff and very good valet. Casino smaller but smoke free with plenty of $15 table games and all the new slot machines. Lots of food choices available. You can walk right into the Aria hotel or take a tram to Bellagio. Easy in and out if you have a car. Decent pool area. This is not a  Luxury hotel but I would love to see the lobby area redone and make the entrance more inviting
20,Staff was very wonderful! Restaurants were bland and I didn’t really care for the fragrance they used for the resort. Definitely geared for an older generation. Rooms were nice but I didn’t understand the layout/theme.
50,My Mr and I always love visiting The Park. This time we had the pleasure of meeting Hank. Thank so much for for your hospitality it was truly genuine and taking the time to share you wine knowledge with us. Also I am so glad the 2 gentlemen who served us the at our last visit were there. They recommended a beer we previously had and our tasting flight. Very professional! Because of our pleasurable experiences you're stuck with us as customers!! Thank you!!
50,It’s always a pleasure to stay at the Park MGM everything is on point there from the casino to the bars and the food. I love the atmosphere it gets busy there but it wasn’t a problem for us. It’s super close to the airport
50,Only positive reviews from the front desk service to the casino to the variety and quality of food choices the bell staff and pool. Both family friendly and good for couples. The property is also very clean. You can't beat EATALY!
10,I usually love to stay at the Park but after this last visit I’m not sure I’ll be back. I added my dad to my room online and he tried to make a room charge and was told he wasn’t on the room. So I called (702)730-7010 and the lady I spoke to was so rude and then hung up on me. When I called back she said I was cutting out and couldn’t understand me. She was just so rude. Also my dad had already charged stuff to the room at the pool earlier that day. The lady kept telling me that it was for my safety so people don’t charge to my room that shouldn’t be.
50,Nice casino with all sort of games and table games. The main perk was it was smoke free and the room was clean. Our stay here was very enjoyable! The pool was nice as well they have total of 3 tools with 1 being 18+ which was a nice touch!
50,it was nice relaxing for family to bondjust have fun but wish to win though 🤣👍. if theres a next time 👍😇🙌🏼❤️mom loves the stay wish to comeback soon love the check in n outonline . overall its amazing would recommend to friends.
50,If you want to be treated like a high roller but play the penny slots this is where you want to go. The hotel and casino was clean. The staff was beyond friendly. Every staff member we encountered had a smile on their faces and went above and beyond to provide the best experience. We were first time guests at this MGM property but it won’t be our last. Highly recommend.
50,I’m visually impaired and use a cane or guide dog. The ENTIRE Park staff and casino dealers were the best I’ve ever had! They were respectful without sounding condescending and we’re very helpful. I routinely stay at MGM properties and this was the best stay ever in spite of paying Las Vegas’ light bill for the month.
30,I stayed here for a few nights and paid for upfront parking and when I was trying to get out to my cards weren’t working so I had to pay again. I spoke to a girl at the check in area and she said that there wasn’t anything she could do. So I paid upfront parking for nothing.
50,The room was clean great view and the bed was so very comfortable. It was quiet the shower pressure was right on point. Starbucks was right down from the room. The Eataly was fabulous! I plan on returning soon. I'd recommend it to anyone who wants to be pampered at the Spa Topping off the Saturday night with an amazing concert.
50,The entire Park staff made me feel like I was at home! Great job! This was my first stay at Park and I will certainly be spending more time there when I’m in Vegas! Very welcoming clean and courteous throughout every area of the hotel.
50,Everything was great from our concert being in the hotel the staff and the overall experience. We even got our concert merchandise in the hotel store. A super convenient one stop shop for everything we needed!
40,Minutes away from the strip!! Definitely recommend the food in the food court over many different food to choose from. The room was nice with a great view but the sheets could have been a little cleaner but overall the experience was great!
50,It just felt like a resort that just kept getting better. The rooms were nice and clean with great views if you can get one. The pools are amazing they already know there’s a lot of guess so there’s multiple pools and a lot of seating area and delicious drinks! The restaurants are great make sure you make a reservation though.
50,Hands down the best hotel experience in Vegas.. Staff and cleanliness top notch. Came in town for Bruno & Silk Sonic and the hotel staff took care of everything from recommendations to directions. Worth the value
50,We really enjoyed staying at Park mgm. My husband kept saying he was so glad we chose it over all the other hotels. It was clean beautifully decorated and updated. The smoke free environment was such a huge plus. Every single staff member we encountered was extremely pleasant as well! Not to mention the location was perfect! Bed were also extremely comfy!
20,We checked in and everything great. Get to our room to nap and our sheets were stained or dirty. We were moved to another room and the bathroom walls were so dirty. Staff very friendly but rooms need thorough cleaning
50,I LOVE that MGM Park is SOMOK FREE! That's the best think about this property! There are plenty of option to eat and the pool is great especially the one that is adult and quiet! We got a great rate for August and we attended the Silk Sonic concert. Eatly is a dope concept and gives you tons of options to eat. This is also on the strip so good options to go to other places easily!
50,My room was available early and because I downloaded the app check-in was seamless and the easiest I've EVER done (EVER). Someone I must've booked an Accessible room but no big deal room was still very clean huge. View was over the pools and looking down towards Aria and the strip it was fine. I didn't know I could get into On the Record without standing in the line so that was a nice surprise! Went to Best Friend and it was as amazing as suggested. Bell desk let me leave my bags there after I checked out and since I still had a room key I was able to stay at the pool for several hours before I needed to leave. Two comp nights no hassling for upgrading and no extra fees!
50,Only snake free casino in Vegas.. I would highly recommend Park MGM very clean and easy to get around. Being snake free is a bonus. Great place to stay. The eaterly food court is the best lots to select from
50,It's always very nice. Clean rooms the best beds omg so comfortable. The best part ; this hotel is dead smack center of everything. M&M store the Coke store. Retail shopping across the street. A Dennys on the corner. Plus the hotel own plaza. Okay to die for. The best bang for your buck. One last thing there steak house  we'll let's just say Bavettes ( hope I spelled that right) is old school excellence 5 stars. Nothing less! For the price of the stay and the service we got and the rooms accommodations I make it a point to stay at this hotel every time I visit. Do it once and you'll do it twice. Good this helps.
50,Park MGM is always a great experience. Knowledgeable friendly staff. Rooms are always clean and taken care of during the stay. Eataly is always a good place To grab an excellent Italian meal or a pastry with great coffee.
50,Clean grounds. Friendly people especially the house keepers. The front desk was great when I needed more shampoo and conditioner they delivered within minutes. The only issue that bothered me was the dark hallways. I was scared of them.
50,Excellent customer service great environment and wonderful room. Very pleased with the stay. The casino is very clean and comfortable environment. No smoking environment. Friendliest staff and best experience ever. Definitely recommended 5 star.
50,I liked being able to check-in online and use my phone as my digital key. However my sister who was staying with me didn't want to add the app to her phone so I asked a young lady in the lobby for assistance. She was terrific and helped me get a physical room key for my sister. The room was clean and well appointed and we enjoyed our stay. This was the third time I've stayed at Park MGM and I'll gladly stay there again although I think I'll avoid times when there are events being held at the arena next door because of the potential for noise.
50,Loved this place . The room was a nice size but the view wasn't to our liking - the staff was nice and allowed us to switch our rooms with no trouble. The food was also amazing Definitely a 5 star hotel
50,I understand that this used to be an old hotel called the Monte Carlo. I never would have guessed it was a reno. My room was beautiful and modern. Just like the pictures on the website. I would stay again if I make it back to Vegas.
50,Clean attentive staff great location fun pools. Love the self-checkin. If you need to be close to T Mobile arena no better choice. Primrose restaurant was very nice Sunday breakfast. Great bloody Mary's ;-)
50,Always a great atmosphere and really nice people. The view was great and the room was very nice and neat. The staff was overly helpful and tentiv. Will definitely be back next year. Planning to make it a yearly trip
50,All of the staff were very nice and welcoming!! Whenever we needed something it was delivered! Loved that the hotel didn’t allow smoking! We had an issue with our safe but it was fixed within 15 minutes!! My boyfriend loved the hotel and would definitely stay there again!
50,Beautiful spacious rooms just elegant. The bathrooms were sparkling clean and the service was wonderful thank you thank you thank you ..I felt safe because staff was always checking my floor. The hotel was packed and the elevators worked well .No long wait time. The Pool was great Olympic style design lots of lounge chairs and Bars . Finally it’s located in the heart of the Vegas Strip. I’ll stay there again .
50,Kind efficient people! We discovered great restaurant for food and service! Toscana restaurant! Was a great find and the other restaurants around were excellent also! Definitely would stay at MGM Again
50,Check in was great the young lady at the desk was so helpful and so friendly ( forgot her name we checked in aboute 6:45 Aug 2) Restaurants staff players club etc. everyone was so helpful. It was my birthday wonderful and exciting!!!!!!! We won some goooood pots and the extra free play was great looking for more incentives so we can return.....
50,Great spacious room. Beds were comfortable great customer service at the lobby . Loved the view . Definitely going to be coming back soon . One of the best hotels I have stayed at in Las Vegas . .. family friendly
50,We were there for the Bruno Mars Anderson Paak and Silk Sonic Show. The hotel staff were quite helpful. We had paid for early check in but when we arrived there wasn’t a room available. They worked to get us a room within 30 minutes of our arrival. The room was very clean and modern with new furniture. The Primrose restaurant has large great pancakes. Also the only non smoking hotel in Las Vegas. Would definitely stay again
40,Had dirty clothes in my room when I checked in also had a strong smell of cologne in the room. I didn't like how I was placed at the very end of the hallway. Never dropped any fees of the room and was never asked if u would like an upgrade
30,We’re not notified of any hotel damage carpet was wet all these fees during check in and checking out. Allergies to shampoo and hand soap. No other accommodations. My husband had to find a cvs to purchase items
10,My room was horrible also it was not clean it smelled like dog number one I think you should let everybody know that your hotel is dog friendly and rather you can be in so many feet of a room with a dog again your cleaning this is not up the part for you to have animals running around like you guys are doing so you might want to work on getting some better cleaning staff there thank you
40,Selected because of it proximity to the venue I was attending. However the bed were too soft and low for me. I needed a firmer mattress. Also did not like the decor the dark hallways were to drab for me
40,Staff was accommodating and courteous. Expect to pay for any room service including an ice bucket. But that’s Vagus. The restaurants we ate in had extremely great service and the food was awesome. Don’t let the size overwhelm you. The train was easy to navigate.
10,This hotel is just subpar compared to others on the strip. The rooms are small with adjoining doors to the rooms. You can hear your neighbors pretty clearly. The light fixture was run with an extension cord. This is all pretty ridiculous. Other hotels in a similar price point would be a better decision.
50,Excellent Non-Smoking Hotel and I will be returning for the Usher concert. This is a wonderful hotel and I recommend this hotel to anyone. Excellent customer services and all staff was on point regarding smiling.
10,The best way to describe the look and feel is that all the money went into the slot machines and none into the rooms. Carpet had gross stains on it blankets and sheets were dirty rooms had little to no light along with the hallways to make it look like a snuff film or a murder scene. Besides that the bathroom was nice besides the fact that it didn’t have a lock of handle on the door.
50,Super clean and no smoke made this stay in Vegas great. Very low key resort and just seemed more classy. Still walking instance to Allegiant and literally right behind t-mobile. It’s in the heart of Vegas.
50,By far the best casino on the strip! The one and only fully SMOKE-FREE casino!!! It's so nice walking in and being able to take a nice deep breath whenever and wherever I want without having to worry about any dangerous second-hand smoke. But the true highlight of this casino lies in the casino floor crew - especially the graveyard shift dice crew.    Sudlar Jeanette (Queen Boss) Joe Dave (pit boss) Skylar Chris (pit/dealer) Fifi/Van Sawndra - and so many more of the dealers/supervisors went above and beyond to make my gambling experience super top tier. All the Thai crew were stellar (I'm terrible at remembering their names). So stellar that I bought them donuts the next morning.    Hopefully MGM gives me some comp rooms at their hotels so I can have easy access to come back and gamble with my new favorite crew. Thanks for making my experience top tier (you guys are so much better than the current Wynn/Encore dealers). Hope to see you guys again soon :)
20,Room was hot - would not cool down. Also had a large thunderstorm come through once evening and water was coming in through the roof into the area were were in. Also had water drip on shoulder that evening walking back through casino.
50,We had a great stay at the Park MGM. The casino/hotel is located on the strip and not as large as other locations. We find this much more enjoyable and easy to navigate. Staff is always super friendly. Just an overall great experience each time. The Eataly is a great spot for casual dining with other great options inside as well.
40,Even though the noise from outside can be loud due to the T Mobile arena the hotel was beautiful. I was a little shocked at the amount of security that was standing around. At first it kind of scared my family and I because we thought something was wrong. I’ve been to many casinos before and never seen this many security before. Besides that they have amazing food choices and a wonderful foot court. The gaming is so so… all in all I would definitely recommend Park MGM.
50,I always stay there because I go there for see Bruno mars concert.easy to access to go theater.  They have tram for to Bellagio and Aria.  Good breakfast restaurant and Starbursts Italian food court.  easy to go CVS and Target 🎯
50,YESTERDAY – ABYSMAL CUSTOMER SERVICE  EXPERIENCE  Called and spoke to three different reps at Aetna – received three different answers to the same  question.  Call Enterprise Rental Car spoke to two different reps and each of them gave me an 800 number to call  and still did not answer my question.  Call CVS pharmacy – put on hold for 56 minutes spoke to no one and hung up.  TODAY – BEYOND EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE EXPERIENCE:  Call Park MGM today for questions about a room reservation. Alice THE AMAZING ALICE answered the  phone. Boy oh Boy did I hit the JACKPOT having Alice as my rep and I had not even stepped foot in the  casino! I explained to Alice that I was visiting Vegas for the first time for a Mother/Daughter trip and to  celebrate my 60th Birthday that was canceled last year due to COVID. Well Alice’s service was UTTER  PERFECTION! She listened to my concerns was extremely accommodating caring and considerate. She  did not talk over me as many reps do. She shared my excitement about my trip and offered suggestions  for restaurants and activities. I truly felt as if I was speaking with an old friend over a cup of tea! Alice  has a heart of gold and it emanates over the phone. I must say that corporations should hire Alice as a  consultant to train their staff in the ULTIMATE CUSTOMER SERVICE EXPERIENCE! The world would be a  better place for sure!
20,If you are wanting hospitality and friendliness this is not the place. Move on to the next choice in Mlife properties. Delano is a superb choice in my opinion. One bad staff sets the tone for the resort.
10,Stains on bed cover and hair all over the bathroom and mess on side of toilet I’m still not sure exactly what that was MGM usually does a good job my first time staying at the park MGM and will be my last time
50,Free 12pm check out  Free bottled water at pool and in room  Plenty of free pool chairs and free umbrellas  Cheap pool chair rentals - $100 for a pod chair on Friday is amazing  No smoking - seriously Bellagio and Cosmo are absolutely disgusting smoke filled casinos - I feel awful for those employees!  Security guard Hank had great recommendations on happy hour and breakfast  A nice Starbucks - with acceptable lines  Best Friend - good portions and prices fast food - 35 mins? $145 for the best meal in Vegas! Not bad! Also the music is awesome. BBQ ribeye = chef’s kiss  Great location with trams to crystal shops  We didn’t experience flooding at this location like you see near Planet Hollywood in Aug.
20,Unfortunately rooms were dirty air conditioning was not working and covers fell off could've hit me or my kids. Television streams so it was on a slow connection. Definitely need to upgrade the rooms to the 21st century. Felt like we were staying at grandma's house.
20,Upon checking in our shower had significant black mold build up. After getting a new room there were multiple wet spots on the carpet. If you walked over these spots. You could feel the wetness. This easily could’ve been more mold. It was a very unpleasant stay to say the least
50,We stayed on a Monday and Tuesday and knew the hotel (and Vegas) would be pretty slow but the staff were so friendly and inviting and told us about all of the best places to visit. We loved the Gaga museum Eataly and NOMAD Pool. It was the perfect visit to unwind and have a little fun as well!
50,The hotel was great! Rooms were clean beds are comfy had no issues at all definitely stay here again.And no smoking casino was a plus lots of variety of food within the hotel incase you don’t want to go out on the strip.
30,Stayed here for the first time. The door had to be slammed to close it everytime. In order to use your points towards your room you have to go to members services before checking out and then go in the check in/ check out line which is long just to check out using your credit. This process needs to be much easier and customer friendly.
50,Park MGM is a beautiful place to stay from the moment you walk in it smells beautiful and the staff is really friendly. Check in was really fast I was asked to check in at VIP even though I was not but he said you are in my eye what a really nice thing to say.
50,Staff was friendly. Casino employees were fun. Everything about our stay was perfect. Rooms were clean and beds were comfy. The only negative which really isn't a negative the hallways are dark and very dim.
50,We had a great experience at Park. Great staff. Pool area was large and easy to find chairs. Rooms were clean beds were comfortable and water pressure was great. Location between NYNY and Aria is perfect as well and easy tram to Bellagio. Will definitely stay here again.
50,Stayed here to watch Silk Sonic so Park MGM was the perfect spot to stay! Also when using Uber/cab there is a designated pickup spot at the side of the hotel that is away from the Main Street so it’s not confusing to spot one another. Close to Hard Rock Cafe Hello Kitty Cafe and Raising Cane’s. Also there’s a Target and Walgreens nearby. Our stay was short so we made sure to enjoy the pool jacuzzi and gym for a bit! Bed was comfy and room was clean and simple. Great place to stay!!
40,Great location and nice room with a comfy mattress and good shower head. Plenty of hot water. Pool was very nice. East check in ( 15 minute wait) Staff was very friendly. Love having a gelato . We could walk any place.
50,all great except the charge for parking was too much it should be offered free self-parking at least and a resort fee killing the mood at the end as well why WE have to pay for it we are spending too much money any way I hope someone will consider that usually vegas were so fun and prices offer now I believe start looking different for a family vacation and vegas were super slow no one there I believe the prices must be changed
50,Park MGM's location was perfect and the ease of the mobile app for check in and the use of the digital key and parking was spot on. It is a clean establishment and we enjoyed its amenities. We loved the fact that the prepaid parking allowed us to park at other MGM properties such as the Bellagio and Mandalay Bay.
50,This is the best MGM property we have seen at the rooms were clean and modern. The staff was friendly and please do not smell like cigarettes. Will definitely be coming back on our next trip to Vegas.
50,Everything was excellent.convenient parkingfast check in fantastic restaurantsexcellent room service and fast service slot machine and close to many convenient store.friendly people and fastmlife box very helpful.
20,There is no mask mandate but hotels are raking in money by not providing room service under the guise of COVID! Shameful and unethical to maximize profit and at the expense of using a disease as a guide. If one can walk around the casino hotel lobby with no mask required why the F**K can't the hotel provide clean rooms empty garbage and room service every day of your stay? One word response - PROFIT!
50,This is the only resort smoke free on the strip. There was another resort we had on our bucket list and we visited it while there. We walked in and were immediately hit by the smoke in the casino. We pretty much decided Park MGM will be our go to.
50,Everything was seamless. The hotel is easy to navigate. Transportation dining gaming shows shopping everything was so convenient. I would always choose thus hotel. Ease of check in and the contact less options.
50,Hotel is clean the staff is friendly and pretty much all the food there is good. Went for the Usher residency and the experience was great the Eatily food center there has so many good italian options the pizza sandwiches pastries were all great. Will definitely look to stay here when in vegas again.
50,Everyone was awesome!!! I would definitely stay here again. Very accommodating and helpful. Accessible to everything around. Very clean nice comfortable beds and very knowledgeable staff and friendly!!
50,Everything was great about this place. Great location great customer service great food options etc. Only thing I didn't like was the King size bed was too low to the ground. I am used to casino beds being high off the ground. Other than that everything was perfect.
40,For non smoking casino that was pretty cool because you didn't have weird smells and stuff. It was nice to have a CVS right next to us to buy things like water soda etc. It's in the heart of the strip so there's a lot around.
10,Everything is old dirty and disgusting common areas smelled like sewage rooms are the worst in the strip incredibly uncomfortable mattresses and the pillows even worse. I felt like I was staying in a 1 start motel.
40,Great location. Primrose restaurant was wonderful as is La La Noodle. If you are seeing a show at the Dolby live theater it’s a no brainer to stay here. Free tram takes you to Aria and Bellagio which was great!
50,The smoke free great staff made this hotel the new go to! Glad we booked this hotel with attending the USHER SHOW! Nomad Pool perfect for Adults. Italian eatery is great also. Every hotel has something missing but this place is a keeper!
50,Nice hotel. Rooms were clean and nicely done. Hotel staff were very helpful 5 stars for that alone. Definitely will stay there again. The location was nice and the walk to NY NY was neat well done.
30,I stayed at Park MGM 8/22 and overall the experience was good. Room were clean and staff was friendly. The pools are not spectacular and you can't really do any kind of lap excercise in case you stay here. 7th floor has a gloomy ambience and lighting was so dim. Room were clean and didn't smell like smoke which was great. Room colors and decco is a bit strange or what some call modern. Didn't care for it. Rooms missing little refrigerator and a coffee maker. Take your portable Keurig and cups.
50,i love staying at the Park MGM. the rooms are nice the people are friendly.....and best of all you dont even have to interact with people for checking in and out. the only change i would make is that it's hard to get a copy of the receipt. I really wish they would automatically email a receipt when you check out.
40,Loved the food and location of the hotel.  Very clean and loved the no smoking!  Location was great to get to other casinos and for shopping.  Eatly was amazing atmosphere and great food!  Will be staying here again!
50,Overall very pleasant experience.  Friendly staff lots to choose from to eat!  We were in Las Vegas for a business conference. Getting from the hotel to our venue was easy no issues.  Casino was clean and drinks complimentary! Very nice!
50,I I had a wonderful time the peoples was great I love this so much I will be back there again on August 29 2022 of the slot machines was great the restaurants was great housekeeping didn’t done a great job front Dess was excellent so I’ll see you again on August 29 of 2022 had a wonderful time
50,I loved my stay. Clean rooms and awesome pool with great food. I stayed here because I was going to attend a show here. Best decision I could have made. Casino floor was nice. I need a refrigerator for my medicine with was provided.
40,Very enjoyable stay in a well renovated hotel. The Italian food court has really good food options. Smokeless casino is major plus. The lobby restaurant has really good food options and the service esas really good. We asked for an early check in and we where in our room by 10 am!
20,Basic mom and pop hotel. Good for the kids. Would like the see more visuals. That are 3d and move. Not still images of barbie dolls at a fake lake. Would not stay here again unless it's a free stay with no resort fees.
50,I love the non smoking casino and bedrooms. No more smoky smell on my clothing and I felt like that was a strong reason why to stay here. Rooms were modern comfortable but not a lot of storage space or counter space in the bathroom. Overall Park MGM is a good value for the money paid.
40,Good clean standard rooms. Non smoking casino and lower minimums are a plus. Nice location and good food options. Easy access to NYNY and Aria. Close to TMobile arena. Great value for the price. Would stay here again.
50,"Kaylee Cole was helpful with my dilemma as I needed to blow up my donut tube so Kaylee said ""Oh for real"" and blew it up for me. I am a big girl so I needed the help of getting a tube since I'm also scared to swim in the water. Ultimately Kaylee was extremely helpful with my situation!"
10,The casino is beautiful and smelled very well on the first floor but the trick was when we got to our room floor it smelled like wet Cartier and mildew our room carpet was wet and the vents were covered in dust. We ended up having to leave do to the fact that it caused my wife to get sick
50,I used to stay at the Monte Carlo back in the day and always loved this property. It was so fun to rediscover the hotel now as the ParkMGM. We came for Silk Sonic in concert and could not believe how easy everything was. The hotel is gorgeous and modern with wonderful food and beverage choices. We ate at Best Friend as we are huge Roy Choi fans. The meal was too good! We also enjoyed exploring Eataly. The Dolby Live venue was really stunning as well. A fantastic place to see a concert. Can't wait to go back!
50,PARKMGM is such an amazing place to stay  for any reason anytime … they welcome you and embrace your stay with making sure you are comfortable and happy and the NON SMOKING is the best . We love it❤️
10,To start I had questions before we checked in and tried to call the front desk. This took hours as I was on hold. I was able to resolve this by calling another MGM casino (Ballagio) to find out the MGM info. Rooms stunk terribly and the bed had a black streak by the pillow. Overall I would never stay here again
50,Loved staying here. Most of the staff was super helpful and friendly. The tram the runs from Park MGM to the Aria the shoppes at crystals and the bellagio is convenient and free. This hotel also has the best little place called the eatery which has so many places to eat and explore as well as a little market. Definitely going to stay here again but next time a suite.
10,It’s great to have digital check in facilities however if they aren’t executed well it defeats the purpose. Eg.. checked in digitally however never received communication on F&B credit check in/our hours of operation.. minibar costs..  rooms still had rubbish left inside from previous guests Eataly was the most confusing- bar closed food closed no signage staff rude… it was a mess…  Asked about f&b credit booked in the room to several staff and all had a different answer… when we checked out on the final night we were made to feel stupid and incompetent.. we both work in 5 star hotels.. so our experience wasn’t unreasonable.. can’t say we would stay here again… a fresh lick of paint doesn’t = a great experience
50,My experience staying at this hotel was great! Check-in using the MGM app was simple and easy. The app gave directions to get to your room from any point around the hotel. The hotel room was decorated very cute and it added to great ambiance Park MGM provides. I did catch a show at the Dolby Theater there and it was easy to navigate from the room as well. Overall great experience.
50,I love the hotel is non smoking and you are in the middle of some very popular hotels nearby. Love to have coffee and breakfast sandwich at Eataly and eat at other local restaurants too. The pool is wonderful as well
10,Excellent venue for a show. Skip the rooms and stay at another hotel. The staff is friendly the Park MGM provides easy access to the strip and the Juniper bar makes terrific craft cocktails. If you like Italian food Eataly provides a variety of Italian treats and food in a fast and efficient manner.
30,With the hotel being attached to the venue where Silk Sonic was performing it was perfect since this was for my 86yr old mother. Eataly and the breakfast spot were really good but the rooms (22nd floor) didn't match the ground experience. Very dated but had a comfortable bed.
50,Park MGM is the best value for a nicer hotel on the Strip. The smoke-free environment is amazing the whole hotel felt very clean and modern. Not as luxurious as maybe some of the other hotels but definitely a step up from the super-budget ones.
20,Casino restaurants and entire 1st floor experience was great! Room & hallway to room was horrible! Dark gloomy & dirty. Started with finding a plastic bag wrapped around our smoke detector then a/c not working requested a fan for the room multiple times and never received after being told it would be arriving. Missed reservations the 1st evening due to waiting for a fan and then was told we don’t need to wait and it would still be delivered. Came back to the room later and still did not have it. Called again said a fan was on its way. Stayed awake waiting and never received. Finally gave up and was uncomfortable the entire stay. Gamble & eat here - don’t stay!
20,Dismal hallways to rooms  No coffee or tea setup  Small bathroom vanities with little counter space  Retail stores do not ship!!  Primrose overpriced.  The round picturesque cylinder on the room floors is a feng shui no no. The cylinder blocks all the positive energy from room to elevator.
30,Service in the casino was nearly non existent. The hotel was very nice and staff was great but. Casino experience was not good. Heaven forbid you get thirsty after hours of putting money in the slots.
10,First let me say the beds were the most uncomfortable I have ever slept on. However the most disturbing problem was how the manager treated me when He found out I had Covid. I had went to the front desk to get my daughter another room as they wouldn’t answer the phone. Shortly thereafter the manager called to tell me how things were going to go. That if I left my room I would not be allowed to re-enter. He never asked how I was or if I needed anything . Within a short time security called my room to check if I was there. I understand the hotel wants to keep their guests safe but I was treated like a criminal.
50,The CLEANEST hotel in Las Vegas!  It's the only smoke-free hotel in Las Vegas. Rooms are spacious with a modern look. The top floors above the Park MGM is the Nomad which has the Old World interior design.  Plus they have such great customer service. No complaints.  Thank you!
40,Other than slow check in even at 11pm on Sunday night everything else was fine. Staff was nice. Wish you had a food court or more dinning options so I do have to leave to NY NY or MGM for cheaper options
50,The casino slots are not really their strong suit. I had better payouts at the airport where they are notorious for having “tight” machines. The rest of the casino as far as amount of table games with varying stakes is on par with the rest of the strip.
50,We arrive Ed Vegas for Bruno Mars show. Walked down to see layout for when we’re scheduled. Hank Graae a security guard gave us some info. Then asked if we’d been here before we said no. Hank then took us on a tour of what food & drink was available. Explaining the happy hours specials best places etc. Hank is also a sommelier and recommended wines. What a great experience for us. MGM should be thrilled to have him on staff.
50,The hotel was nice and staff was very helpful I made my reservation 6 months before my arrival I found the room to be as describe very beautiful. I didn’t have a room with a view but I was told that during the booking.The property was keep clean free of trash.
50,i like this hotel because no smoke inside the hotel and casino area. All the staffs are friendly to reply my question. The food court area is so good. i have lots of fun to enjoy different kind of foods there every day.
50,The staffs were very friendly & accommodating. The room we stayed smells fresh & clean. Eventhough there was no refrigerator in our room the ice machine compensated for cold drinks after staying outside on a very hot summer day. Casino floors were clean. Overall very relaxing stay.
10,First room the air conditioner did not work. Items from previous guest.  Second room used towels in the bathroom. Had to move my items myself to second room. But the lady at the front desk told me the key would only work for 1/2 hour to get my luggage out and move them. She did not tell me that the card would only work one time. She knew i was by myself. So then had to go back down to the front desk. I was hot and sweaty. So i decided to take a shower in the second room. And there was dirty towels in my second room.
30,it was an okay stay! Wasn't impressed by the room the bathroom is cramped tiny space for a two queen bedroom! carpet is stained! this is one and done for this hotel! giving this a 3 star I like the food place EATALY.
30,We had a ton of issues. Park MGM was not forthcoming on a lot of issues for our 70 person family visiting Las Vegas. People would have liked to have known that they had to get a room on the same floor as our hospitailty suite. We had to send people to collect each other. Also no one was expecting incidentals charges that high.
20,"Stayed 1 night solely for the purpose of attending a concert at the Dolby Live Theater. The theater is great doesn't seem like there's a bad seat in the house!  The hotel however ... the convenience to the theater was the only great part about it. The App/Digital Key for the room didn't work (it did for the elevator but not the room) so we had to return to the lobby 3 times before we could access the room. The hallways are dark and the room we had felt old and run-down with chipped pieces of tile missing in the shower old furniture etc. AND - even though the Park MGM is completely non-smoking (which I loved the idea of!) there was still some sort of smell that permeated everything and unfortunately it seemed like it could be an ""old"" smoke smell."
40,Stayed here to attend the Silk Sonic concert. Eataly was phenomenal and it was very easy access to airport. I recommend this hotel for short stay. One thing I wish they focused some attention on is the condition of the hallways where the rooms are. Those were not appealing.
30,This was a girls trip to see the Silk Sonic concert. The pros..close to Dolby Live and the food at Primrose. The cons..I was quoted $617 but was charged more like $850 (will be calling about that)..there were no extra charges that should have been placed on my room tab. Also the bathroom toilet continuously ran there was a permanent dirt ring in the sink there was an odor in the hallway (maybe pet) and the hallways are dark. I probably will not return.
10,The room was wet. It smell really bad. The towels were dirty. In the morning the maintenance people were knocking at my door. I could not sleep because they were making a lot of noise. We did not get the resort fees voided because of this incident. I will not stay at this place ever again.
10,For almost $500USD the room compares to a dilapidated hotel there was no ventilation in the wash room snd the toiletries were subpar the room barely has good lighting and the RED PAINT inside the room is not giving! it's a no brainer whoever gets the idea of painting it red probably has passion
30,The location of the Hotel is great the Casino area was fun. The hallway and room was not clean or kept to look new. The smell was terrible there was construction being done in a room near bye. It being one of the newer hotels I expected a great looking hote
50,I would highly recommend staying at the Park. It is smoke free so you do not hit a wall of smoke entering the casino floor. the rooms are nice and clean. And there are many dining options. Bavettes is a must for a great steak.
20,There are several reasons. First there wasn't a refrigerator in the room. Of course there wasn't... you want to make sure people don't bring outside food or beverages into the hotel. Your greedy self wants everyone to buy from restaurants inside the hotel. When asked if I could get a refrigerator I was charged roughly $80 per day for it... unbelievable! My wife has medicine that needs to stay in a cool place so I had to rent the piece of sh  Crap... It didn't have 1 shelf in it and looked like someone hit it with a hammer 50 times. Our room did not have wash clothes and no towel for the bathroom floor to step out of the shower onto. The carpet had stains everywhere. I travel a lot and stay in hotels all throughout the USA and I have to say it was the worst room I've ever stayed in.
50,Non smoking hotel just off the strip so no foot traffic. Very clean no homeless no Marijuana smokers. Very friendly and professional staff. Never have to hunt for a drink waitress/waiter. Hotel is even pet friendly with a small outside yard
10,Wanted to check in for the night for the Silk Sonic concert (Very Nice) first suite literally had crap on the seat. Requested another room and was given one that looked completely out of service and smelled like weed. Never felt so disrespected as a quest and this was our anniversary. Received a lot of comps BUT!?!
50,I had a great time staying here from easy check in and check out to accommodations to a room with a better view and I absolutely loved that there was no smoking in the hotel. Pool was great staff was friendly I have no complaints. I had a wonderful time and it’s so convenient staying at Park MGM as Dolby Live is attached. This was the best choice as I went to see Silk Sonic perform but concert or not I will definitely be coming back here for future visits.
30,The experience was simply mid-tier. I expected more of a MGM property on the strip. The hallways were very dark and uninviting. The Dolby Live experience was exceptional. I also wish there were more places to eat in the hotel itself.
40,I went to a concert at the Dolby Live venue so it was very convenient. It was clean and the staff was friendly. Overall of fine trip. Not the fanciest place I’ve ever been but absolutely not the worst.
40,If you are seeing a show or event at Dolby Live or T-Mobile this is a great place to stay. Very hard to find a nice place to eat without having a reservation. The quality of the in room tissue toilet paper and towels was very LOW. All very thin not what I expect from or find at better resorts.
10,Blood stains on comforter insert. Room smelled of old aftershave and cigarettes. Ordered clean glasses and it took 3 hours for delivery. Front desk did nothing about it. Left hotel after 1 night. Beware
10,Buyer beware $18 for a bottle of water from the room mini bar. Housekeeping only serviced the room 1x on a 3 night stay. Expensive resort fees that provide the only benefit of WIFI. Best part is this is a non-smoking facility.
20,The hotel room wasn't available until after 6. We were aware of 3 pm but was later told it could be as late as 6. Not good. Getting off the elevator the carpets looked stained and the rooms are quite dated and the door stuck. The only redeeming thing is Silk Sonic performed there. The show is absolutely awesome. I would not stay there again with so many other hotels available on the Strip.
50,This was my first stay at MGM Park & it did not disappoint. The staff was friendly clean air when you walk through and the pool was relaxing environment. The rooms had great design. Above all we love how close we were to other places like target! :)
30,The hotel is very nice looking unfortunately the room I stayed in had a damp smell to it the floor where I stayed was getting worked done during my whole stay making hard to sleep in during the mornings (due to the noise from the repairs). The pool was clean the day of my arrival which was on a Sunday but by Friday the pool water was dirty with papers floating around and some sort of oil floating around the edges (which I am going to assume it was from all the sunscreen from the week).
50,great experience great location great service. overall had a great time.... ming at the blackjack table was a lot of fun... like the convenience of checking in and checking out.... will definitely stay again
10,The hallway carpeting was visibly stained. It also smelled really bad. The hallway lighting is dark. The room also smelled and is very outdated. All the carpeting needs to be pulled up and replaced with something that can easily be cleaned. The hallways needs to be painted a lighter color and lighting brighter.
30,The lobby staff was not very friendly and at one point did not acknowledge me standing at what I thought was the check in desk. Instead I just stood there watching them laugh and talk as if I were invisible.    They also do not have refrigerators or microwaves in the rooms. We were there for a family reunion and had a number of rooms booked. We had food in the hospitality room and food that we would get from the numerous eateries in the area. If you did not finish the food you had you were forced to throw it away because there was no way to preserve it.
50,This is very clean and well maintained resort. The staff is very friendly and very helpful if needed. Very good selection of resturants. Very nice pool area. We would highly recommend staying at the Park and will definitely return.
40,We will stay at Park MGM again just for the location and the non-smoking aspect. The rooms were OK nothing to write home about but the staff was beyond amazing! Casino is a little small and doesn't seem to have a good variety of machines. But it really is about location location. Love that you can take a Tram to Bellagio without really going outside.
10,There are no microwaves or refrigerators inside guest rooms. The guest bathrooms located inside each room have no ventilation systems. The food and drink prices are RIDICULOUS. The pool area closes too early(7p).
20,Dirty room. Not clean at all. Missing a lot of usual things a room must have. Like fridge bath rob. Do not disturb tag. TV guide. The room have is not clean at all. They missed some trash in the floor and the hair dryer handle is sticky. Ewww
30,I was expecting the best when I booked this hotel for the weekend. But no what I got in my room was unsatisfactory. No phone no radio and the flatscreen tv did not want work. Not staying here again until the rooms are renovated.
30,I loved the hotel . The one thing I didn’t like was the room cleaning . Had to call down to get the room cleaned. If not they would of never been cleaned . Was very disappointed. Had to tell them to only bring towels since it was already in the afternoon.
50,We stayed at the Park MGM for two nights and we had a GREAT time! My husband used the fitness center which was clean with a variety of options to stay in shape while on vacation. The staff was very helpful and the room was GREAT (very clean). Most of all we LOVED the fact that the casino is non-smoking!
50,Looking forward to coming back in October. We enjoyed our stay from fantastic room to enjoying our experiences in eating out. The personnel was wonderful always trying to please the customers. Will seek out the great personnel we dealt with in July.
40,I stayed at the park MGM Las Vegas because I had tickets to see silk sonic at the same venue. The hotel is very nice it is completely smoke-free which was a plus. I stayed in a strip view suite room on the 27th floor. Even though it was a strip view our window was about the distance of 2 football fields from the street. The room was very large and clean. I would absolutely stay here again. Another plus was that we had daily housekeeping which is a rare find in most hotels nowadays. I stayed 3 nights.
10,1st dirty tv and phone didn’t work. Changed to a 2nd room. Keys were supposedly switched over and weren’t. I had to go downstairs and wait in line for 20 minutes and the clerk wouldn’t compensate anything for the inconvenience. 2nd room dirty. Never returning. Extremely disappointing
50,Really nice hotel. The non-smoking atmosphere was refreshing. Great concierge customer experience. Nice proximity to connecting hotels. The Dolby theater was a nice venue with great seats! Would definitely stay again.
50,The room was clean and comfortable. However the houseman for the floor we were on took very good care of us! Room 825 had a slow draining sink once we informed him he took care of it! Forever grateful for his dedication to his job and the guests that stay there!!!
50,Very great stay good experience very clean everyone was very friendly and helpful 1000/10 would definitely recommend. I was there for a birthday trip and it was the most fun I’ve ever had I will be coming back
40,My only issue (which isn’t a big deal) is that there ain’t enough storage in the rooms to unpack. Otherwise we love this hotel. The location is great the staff is extremely helpful and I LOVE the non smoking rule very much!
20,I reached out to Park MGM through their message system a week before posting this review to give them a chance to respond and make it right but all I got was crickets. Stay away from Park MGM. Management doesn’t care about their guests.    Upon arrival on the first day the bathroom floor was dirty and had big dust balls and hair in the corners. The carpeting in the room was stained and when we made the bed ourselves (because housekeeping never showed up) I pulled the mattress cover over the one corner of the mattress because it was coming off and saw that the mattress underneath the cover was splattered in what looked like blood. Gross! (See photo).    Also the bathtub floor was peeling (see photo) . It was probably painted over at some point and now the paint was peeling off. I wanted to take a hot bath to loosen up my back muscles from sleeping on the very worn-out mattress but could not do so due to the peeling paint (see photo).    Our room was not cleaned even once during our three night stay. On our last day at 3:30pm I asked a house keeper (who was talking on her cell phone while cleaning the room across the hall) when she could get to our room because we needed to shower to get ready for dinner and a show. We had been gone from the room for hours each day but not once did it ever get cleaned. She said she’d come next. Great! Thirty minutes went by and she still had not come. I peeked in the hall and she was still on her phone (texting this time) in the room across the hall that was still not finished being cleaned. I asked her nicely if we could just have some fresh towels since we had to start getting ready for our evening. Coming back every day to a dirty room is unacceptable and by late afternoon we needed the room to shower and get ready for our evening.    The bed mattress was way past it’s usability. The built-in mattress topper had been worn down and material inside was in clumps. It felt like we were sleeping on pieces of wadded up toilet paper. There was no give in the springs so we both slept in valleys with a peak between us. Both of us woke up with back pain every morning. The mattress did not have a box spring yet this was not a hybrid mattress. It needed a box spring to give the necessary support when lying down. It needs to be replaced badly!!! I had not expected such a poor mattress from an MGM resort. It was so worn out.    Lastly we paid to have a “strip view” but most of the view was of the lower roof of the hotel (see photo). This hotel should not charge extra for a strip view as it is awful. We could see the Hard Rock Cafe and Target. Wow! On our last visit we had a better view of New York New York without paying extra for a strip view. Don’t make the same mistake (See photo).    This was our 3rd time staying at Park MGM. I’m not one to complain but this was just an awful experience for what we thought was a quality hotel on the Las Vegas strip. Since I never received a reply back from Park MGM after letting them know about the problems during our stay. I used the “contact us” link on the Park MGM website. I asked for someone to contact me but no one did. It just shows that they don’t care about their guests. This place has really gone downhill.
20,Carpet way too old sink had ring around it that would not come out! Yuck! Air conditioning not working properly room was really stuffy. Also they kept trying authorize to my cc for several different amounts… then finally got almost $100 more that’s what I was quoted over the phone and via check in
30,The hotel as a whole is pretty solid. Decent pool and lounge setup. Smoke free is great. Convenient tram and proximity to fun. Check in and out easy.    But my personal experience was marred with the discovery of a room safe full of illicit drugs left behind by the previous guest. Although security was quick to respond and remove the compensation of just a meal coupon at Park MGM food vendors was disappointing. It wasn't even valid within the MGM Group just Park.    It didn't help that the air conditioner was very weak in cooling the room quickly.    That said as a whole it's a solid place to stay. But personally service and compensation could have been a lot better.
50,Beautiful Decor soft beds VERY clean! Everytime I came back to my room housekeeping was visible. I even saw the carpet cleaner! Loved that there was a luggage storage area so that I could go register at my convention and grab a bite to eat before checking in. Unfortunately I had to leave in the middle of a session due to the app not working to check in so had to leave and stand in line to check in. The Fitness Gym was the HIGHLIGHT of my experience. OMG! It was BEYOND what I expected to see in a hotel! It was even better then some of your most popular gyms! LOVED IT! The only reason I didn't give this experience a 10 was because the check in app wasn't user friendly (I used it for 2 MGM hotels this week and both were a fail) and also there was no coffee maker or fridge. My mom has medical issues including being diabetic and having a fridge would have been great for her.
50,Best stay ever. Easy to get around the strip. Starbucks fast and easy in the am . Eately is a definite must while staying there! Staff is friendly and efficient. Showers are some of the best . Definitely going to book again for next year.
50,The location was perfect for this trip. I was there for the Silk Sonic concert. Very convenient to walk from my room thru the casino floor to get to the concert venue. The restaurants were nice. The upgrade done from the old Monte Carlo days is nice.
20,It was dirty need of updating and repair and the hallways were extremely noisy beds very uncomfortable and absolutely horrible pillows that gave us neck aches in the morning after no sleep. This was our fifth wedding anniversary and tenth year together so I really wish that it had a different result.
50,Extremely friendly and helpful staff. Clean and nice rooms. Close to everything. We walked pretty much everywhere. This was my first time in Vegas and I would definitely come back to stay at this hotel.
40,Loved that this was a smoke free property. Every staff person I encountered was friendly and helpful. Housekeeping was especially helpful and accommodating. I recommend this place to stay while in Las Vegas...
20,Outdated rooms and pool area. Rooms smelled like body odor. Hallway smelled like sewer. Stained carpets and furniture. Food room service and valet very expensive. Only benefit is easy access to Dolby Live venue.
20,Water pipe busted right outside our room and filled our room with water. On the day of my wife’s birthday we came back to our room to see maintenance at our room with our door open and water all over the floor and we were planning on changing and heading out for the night but we’re not able to due to the fact that we were not allowed into our room for safety reasons. The engineer told us he would get us another room and would call asap but after an hour of waiting I proceeded to the front desk to ask what was going on with our room change they told me that they could not upgrade up to a suite due to the issue of other rooms with similar issues and and about another 45 minutes we we given another room were we processed to move our belongings to which took another 2 hours due to waiting for the bell desk and a cart to move our things. Finally getting to the room and situated just to find out that our a/c unit wasn’t working properly at that time we were frustrated and just when to bed for my wife’s birthday had been ruined. The next morning I again had to ask for another room change and once again was inconvenient with changing to another room. We enjoyed what the hotel had to offer but that was such an inconvenience to us and my wife’s birthday.
10,When we just checked in room (double beds). We found that there are several spots on both blanket and pillows (exterior) which looks like some stains and molds there. It’s so disgusting. So we called the front desk to see what we can do. Then waited over 5 minutes they arranged us another rooms which is the same thing but the stains and molds were appeared inside the blanks and underneath of the pillow cases. Also  the toilet bowl is so disgusting too. The house keeper might forget the clean and the shower door was full of fingerprints and stains as well. So we called the front desk and asked for a room change again the same person who pickup the calls and told us he will send someone to check out the room. We wait almost 30 mins for the person who came. The guy seems not surprised at all and Just told us he will send a housekeeper to replace the bedding’s for us and clear the Restroom again. We doubt that for a 4 star standard hotel which provided us this kind of cleanliness and customer service are totally unacceptable. So we will not recommend this to any of my friend or family. Thank you
10,"When I checked in the room I had reserved was not available. I was told I would have to wait for a couple of hours. My second choice for a room (standard with a king bed) was also unavailable. I settled for a standard double queen bed room.    When I walked away from the check-in desk I was overwhelmed by the smell of marijuana. I chose to stay at this hotel because it is non-smoking (but not enforced).    I took the elevator to the 25th floor (where my room is located) and immediately smell sewage. I dropped off my luggage in my room and saw a security guard standing by the elevator. I asked if she could smell sewage and she responded ""not on this floor)."" There was obviously a problem with sewage somewhere in the hotel and I had the misfortune of having a keen sense of smell.    I subsequently went to the MGM (VIP) check-in desk (I have an MGM Platinum card) to inform them about the sewage smell. I was told that the manager would be notified. I'm not sure if the manager was ever notified but I was never contacted by management.    When I went to the gym the next morning I again smelled sewage. I don't know what happened at this hotel but it wasn't good.    I was only there for two nights but the maid did not have the time to clean my room and make my bed.    Overall this was a bad experience. I usually travel to Vegas every six to eight weeks. I have a lot of choices of where to stay because of my Platinum card status. I will choose elsewhere next time."
50,Great non smoking casino. The swimming pool was awesome and clean rented the Gazebo absolutely great service in the pool and great room service in room delicious food in room service and pool. Casino gaming great too I won jackpot 1205.00.
20,There was a lot of noise late at night and early in the morning possibly from our neighbors. The noise scared us a few times at around 1am-3am. It was a screeching/sharp noise. The following morning at was woken up at around 9am by possible the neighbor opening there curtains. They then continued talking for another hr. I could literally hear their conversation from my room. This is the first time I can hear the people in rooms next to me at a hotel. Also to our surprised there was no fridge in the room and only ONE trash! We got the 2 Queens 1 bed was comfortable and the other one was wear out and not comfortable at all. There was also dirty drink glasses in the hallway that was left there the whole time we stayed there (2 nights).
50,The room and casino was very Clean friendly staff nice room amenities enjoyed grabbing and sharing a variety of food at Eately and non smoking! Great prices at Eately I purchase hard to find products and bring them back with me. Morning coffee bar Lavazza coffee and pastries is a great way to start your morning engine!
50,I love the Park MGM. The non smoking was the selling point to get us there however the rooms pools restaurants and staff will keep us coming back. We had an exceptional experience at the Park MGM. Eataly is amazing for quick snacks or full meals. Primrose is a beautiful restaurant with amazing food and very friendly staff. Also with the connection to the tram and hallway to the Aria and it being a very short walk to New York New York the Park MGM is the perfect location to everything! 100% recommend this hotel/casino for your next stay in Vegas.
50,I really loved the look of the hotel and the proximity to shopping centers malls and other restaurants. I was able to walk most places and I personally enjoyed that. I also love the there are bridges and connects to most of the nearby hotels which allow most of the walking to be done in air conditioned hallways.
50,We loved our stay here. The staff was so friendly and helpful when we needed things. Only downfall was the tv in the room didn't work very well. The Eataly in the hotel had such great food. We would stay here again.
50,Lots of Hotels in Las Vegas Sometimes it’s very hard to pick and choose where to stay but with the Park MGM you are right there and everything is within your reach relax and enjoy in smoke free Hotel.  You are welcome.
50,The Hotel was nice but no coffee makers or refrigerators? other than that the hotel was great and the show was SUPER with the greatest sound system in the world!! The employees were very polite and the rooms were nice we shall return!!!
50,Friendly staff clean rooms great food and easy access to Las Vegas strip! Overall great stay and would definitely stay at Park MGM again and again. I would definitely recommend this hotel located conveniently on the strip!
20,Terrible regarding guest room cleanliness. We do really appreciate the non-smoking policy. Staff is polite but don't respond appropriately to customer complaints. This has made me rethink about where we shoul take our business in the future.
50,I stayed at the Park MGM as the venue is non smoking which is great! Our stay was great room was ready using online check in and room was ready by the time we got to the hotel at noon. I had made reservations at Primrose food and service great as we were hungry! Nighthawk suite was great size is nice ! Bavette”s great venue and food is terrific! Silk sonic at the Dolby live outstanding show and venue being hotel awesome!
50,Rooms were clean but were quite comfortable. Had a partial strip view looking south a nyny which was nice Floor was quite. I will be staying here agian and i would recommend everyone stay here at least once
30,Park MGM is fine but it’s not a 4-star hotel as advertised. Keep this is mind when booking. The inexpensive price is great however you should be aware that the price reflects a 3-star experience. So you are not necessarily getting a “great deal.”    The location is great and it connects with the Aria. Nice staff.
10,Unable to contact property informing about our late arrival due to flight delays. We bought an upgraded suite and arrived at a used room. Informed front desk and informed that this case always happens. Only gave us $50 food credit for 2 days.
40,Overall good stay. So nice to have a smoke free hotel. Pools are great. Beds were super comfortable. Room AC was good on 110° days. Excellent food at Eataly. It’s a pain to get rewards points for restaurants. You have to turn in your receipts. It’s 2022. You should be able to scan your card at each restaurant. Standing in line not worth the time for the points.    Only issue was the bathroom. Random hairs that weren’t ours and stained towels.
50,Park MGM was our savior from the super gross hotels; after being at the Excalibur for a buddie’s birthday. The other place was so gross we debated on flying back after one night.    We stayed at Park MGM for three days recovering from bouts of totally Booz filled nights- their windows truly block light; which helps the hangover the next day.    Lots of great sex & housekeeping supplied the enormous amount of towels for such a long crazy fun weekend 🤣🤣🤣    Thank you Park MGM- our oasis in some filthy places. Truly the best part of Las Vegas strip
10,Terrible!!!!!!!  The service was terrible  The cleanliness was terrible  The room was terrible  The pool was terrible and dirty  Just the location is good (almost good….)  The service was terrible 😞 …………..
50,Me and the wife took a trip for the weekend our experience with the park MGM was great it was located right across T-Mobile arena . We able to walk to great shops always as delicious fine dinning . With our having to spend extra money on Ubers .
50,Love this casino and hotel. Everyone was so courteous accommodating and helpful. The rooms are fabulous and the casino is just as fabulous!!! The food is out of this world delicious. The many different pools were awesome!!!
10,Smell like someone died in our room. Apparently pipes busted during the flood and there was obvious damage. I would assume the floor was Not properly cleaned post flooding and the hotel refused to refund our money. Mgr never called back. Terrible customer service. DO NOT BOOK here. And the AC not working
50,Everything was great and exceptional. Only problem was having to wait 2 hrs the first night for extra pillows and blankets. The second night after making 3 phone calls to HouseKeeping I had to wait another 2 hrs for a mini fridge
50,Positive staff that was welcoming Room rates good during week. Easy access to casino and strip. The fact that the concert was in the hotel was a major plus to the trip . Easy access to gym and salon.
40,Nice rooms and staff with the exception of one Bartender (wore mask) at the center Bar in the casino. Just not a nice person. He told my wife she had to pay for her beer but my beer was comped. I was playing a machine next to her. Basically she had to pay $8 for her beer because she wasn't putting her money into the machine at the bar fast enough. Ridiculous! I have been going to Vegas for the last 45 years and never experienced anything like this. Avoid the casino bar if the guy with a mask on is working. I believe he thought he was the chief in charge.
50,I have fallen in love with the park. Suite was just Beautiful They are located right by the elevator witch is perfect. Very Clean. The full Casino is so nice and always willing to helpright on it if your in a pickle. Thank you wl book soon.
50,Park MGM provided an amazing dining pool concert and club experience. I would definitely stay there again. Primrose and Best Friend were our favorite restaurants. The Dolby Live theater was the perfect size and On The Record was a fun after party.
50,My trip to Las Vegas was a pleasure the MGM PARK staff location and comfort was perfect make it easy to enjoy the receptionist in the check in was really nice all service that I requested was attended with efficient
40,Clean rooms and the smoke free environment was especially great for my personal preference.  It would be nice to have a coffee machine microwave or mini fridge fir leftovers.  Otherwise I am going to return to the mgm fir sure
50,Outstanding service in all areas. Park MGM is a great casino to stay at. The rooms are very nice checking in thru the app is a breeze and your room key is on your phone. Several very good restaurants to choose from and the tram ride to Bellagio is nice.
50,This hotel grew on me during my stay. Big plus is that this is a no smoking hotel! The hotel has great selection of restaurants and bars including the excellent Nomad Library Bar which has to be seen to be believed & the Eataly for all things Italian. I used the pools daily and there were plenty of loungers and excellent service from the staff. Would stay again at this hotel in a heartbeat if the price was right. Good location with tram to Bellagio & Aria hotels.
50,Great service and accommodation! We enjoyed the room with a view overlooking the pools! Also the cafes and restaurants at the Eaterly have so many eating options from simple to fine Italian cuisine.
50,It was so nice to have a non smoking Hotel. Casino was jumping! The tables were filled with very nice people. The dealers were just and pleasant. Staying in the hotel where we Iike to have fun is a plus! We will definitely revisit this place.
40,It was so nice to be in a smoke-free environment! We had a stay well room which was lovely. Our only complaint was that from time to time there was an odor which smelled like sewage in the hallways and in our room.
40,Nice and clean. Everyone was nice and friendly. Really enjoy my family time there. Will be back for sure. Food there was good. Didn’t win much money but it’s okay my kids loved the pool and at nice we had a nice view.
50,Loved the slots and the food. The employees were very nice and friendly. I really had such a good good time! The smoke free atmosphere was wonderful! It was a bit crowded when the show let out at night but they were all happy.
50,The room was wonderful! The bathroom modern clean and spacious! Eataly was phenomenal and easily the best assortment of foods to choose from over other places I’ve stayed on the strip! We ate there several times and that makes me want to stay there specifically at Park MGM again!! Thank you!
40,"I was on the casino floor when the ""active shooter"" situation occurred. Pure panic from guests and staff alike. I would recommend more training for the staff to successfully evacuate patrons. Tough to do I understand. But having panicked staff doesn't help matters. La La Noddle's was awesome as was the crepes from the eatery. Very nice rooms love the smoke free atmosphere. Casino host is awesome as well! Will be back over and over!"
50,We really enjoyed our stay at Park MGM. The rooms were nice we requested a refrigerator and adjoining rooms which we received both. No long lines for elevators. The pool area is amazing. Plenty of seats with umbrellas for free! You don’t find that often in Vegas. Chuck the bar tender at the pool bar was great! Everything was really clean. Casino is smallish but plenty to do and close to other casinos. Eataly was interesting. They could really use more seating there. We highly recommend trying this hotel and we plan to go back!
50,Is always Nicest place you ever want to be in on your vacation is always clean and people are very warm makes you feel at home especially in the baccarat room they have the team of supervisors makes you feel very comfortable to be there I been going to Las Vegas for 50 year and now I finally found one hotel that I want to go to every time I go to Las Vegas
40,We got caught up in the panic caused by a rock that was thrown at a window in Eataly. The ensuing chaos caused my wife to slip and hurt her knee. I also lost my credits in the slot machine and were worried about the rumors about the supposed shooter.
50,Love that it’s smoke free. It has just enough of everything with out being too much. Shower had great water pressure. Pools where clean and good service pool side. Complementary water at pool! The perfect hotel for mother daughter relaxing getaway! Eataly had great food and pastries! A taste of Italy!
50,I love staying there every time!! Love the hotel and the rooms. My daughter loved the view and the pool. The location between the self-parking entrance and hotel entrance did very convenient. Along with getting to the pool and casino area.
50,My best experience in Vegas since the pandemic. My friend and her father felt at ease in their room and in the casino as covid still runs through. We didn’t have any worries and no smoking in the casino was the added bonus.
40,The stay was good there’s some noisy pipes or something in the room i was in though…i like the fact that its non smoking just need to get an upgraded room so that hopefully I’m not awaken by pipe noise in the future
50,The location was wonderful for the concert the onsite restaurants options were great and the staff were so friendly and professional. We loved being able to leave the concert and go to our rooms. I would do it again and again.
50,Overall great service would be staying here again. Clean rooms and the hotel is amazing. Pools are clean and well attended. Parking was great getting in and out of the casino. In a prime location on the Las Vegas strip near all of the best casinos and shows.
20,I was hoping for something a little better out of my Park MGM experience than I got. I had heard that since it's renovation from Monte Carlo that the quality of the hotel (and rooms in particular) had really improved.    While the casino and common areas are completely fine I thought the room was pretty poor. Stains all over the carpet stains on the furniture old ratty fixtures hair on the bathroom floor and perhaps the hardest mattress I've ever slept on all added up to something well below my expectations. When I compare Park MGM to the MGM Grand or New York New York I think from a room quality perspective that's it's clearly below both of them. Although I had booked for four nights I checked out after the first night and decided to stay somewhere else.    Don't get me wrong: if your expectations are set correctly then the Park MGM is acceptable. It's basic and inexpensive and the location is great. But there are better options available nearby at the same price point.
40,I am staying for 4 nights and so far I have been having a great experience. The location is very good as it is very convenient. You can go to many place in walking distances and the room fee is acceptable. I love the Eataly street because it looks very pretty and pleasant. The food is awesome and I love the pizzas and the seafood!
10,Was told my room would be comped and was charged $90. Emailed them and got no reply. Then I was charged all the resort fees when I'm a gold card member and supposed to be compled. Very disappointed so I'm switching to Caesar rewards.
50,Park MGM is clean and friendly. The location is great and the price is the best value on the strip. There are cheaper locations on the strip but not nearly as nice for the price. There are more luxurious places though they seem more crowded and hectic and they are not worth the added expense unless you don't care about money.
20,Did my room check in via the MGM app. which was not bad. The rooms are dated however the bathroom was nice. The water in my room would not get hot. The resturants in the hotel close to early for those thats up late.
50,Our family enjoyed our stay. There was a crowd there for the Usher concert but the staff handled it with ease. Valet was quick and efficient. Wonderful staff and pleasant experience! We will definitely stay again!!!
50,I have walked past the Park MGM many times but this was my first stay there. I was happy with the accommodations. Park MGM was also the host of my two day convention and all the staff were extremely helpful. They made sure my attendees enjoyed their experience.
40,Check in was smooth. Love the fact that it smoke free. All the restaurants in there was great. We really enjoyed Eataly. The only thing I did not like was the dark hallways where rooms are it was creepy walking up there alone. They need brighter lights. Also our room had a ton of red not sure what's up with that color scheme.
50,It was a good trip just wish they accommodated us a little better. Can’t complain though this casino is definitely recommended! Very close to shopping centers and great places to eat. Great casino games and fun places to have a nice adult drink!
50,I and my better half were very happy to have selected the Park MGM Hotek Casino for the place to spend time to enjoy our good time watch entertainment such as concert shows and shopping. Enjoyed very much the delicious food at the Eataly.
50,We stayed over a long weekend and truly enjoyed the convenience of a non-smoking casino with a fantastic concert venue and amazing steakhouse (Bavette’s). We spent time in the pool and were hosted well each time we visited.
10,No water in room for hours during our last night  No working room phone.  Horrible attitude from staff that was very discriminative and racist to an extent  Bent mattress that gave me back pain and headaches
40,Any casino that is smoke free deserves at least 4 stars. Had slow drain in sink. Pool choices were nice but rooms were small. The food choices were very pricey especially the bar at the pool. Eataly is your best bet at $20 bucks per sandwich yikes!
40,The hallways were too dark. Very scary to walk alone. They need to brighten the hallways more with brighter paint and lighting. We went with just us girls and we never walked alone in the halls. It was just too dark and creepy. If anything needs to be changed. It’s the dark hallways.
50,We had a great stay and the MGM Park. The location is great. Service was excellent. Great food options and gambling.I like that it is smoke free I did not go home smelling like an ashtray. I would highly recommend staying here
50,Park MGM is a excellent hotel/casino with friendly service clean rooms and easy access to the pool area and restaurants. Primrose is my favorite restaurant the food is great along with excellent service.
20,Unnecessary cost. Stayed at better hotels. No refrigerator and water was $14 dollars. Was not informed of the charges and security deposit. Will never stay at this location. My husband was disappointed.
10,Service was terrible didn’t have any water in the room couldn’t flush the toilets. Was told the water would be back on in a few hours. So I went and hung out with family to get something to drink because of the stressful experience I had. When I came back the staff stated the water back on and the water in my room wasn’t on. I also had water leakage where the light is and I contact guest services she act like I was making stuff up. So I did a video of the water leakage and the no water running and took it to the front desk. Maintenance came and stated that it wasn’t safe for me to be in the room and I need to move room immediately but they didn’t have any room available so they told him to fix it. It was after 5 am I was exhausted and I had to wait while three mens from maintenance try to fix the issues. Then on top of that the cold water wasn’t working and I couldn’t flush the toilet. It was the worst experience that I ever had at any hotel I ever stayed at.
50,The Park MGM is an exceptional place to stay in Las Vegas. The hotel the casino and all restaurants are smoke free. There are several nice dining options at the Park MGM including several options in Eataly. There are also many more dining options just a short walk away in the Cosmopolitan the New York New York the MGM and all other casinos in the area. The pool areas are nice and the cost to rent the daybeds and cabanas are very reasonable. I recommend renting the daybeds and cabanas the day you intend to use them it seemed like they were more reasonably priced the day of use than they were to reserve online the day before. The rooms are spacious with a nice couch a table and extra seating.
50,The Park MGM Las Vegas was the first place I thought of to celebrate my accomplishment with family and friends. This is the second time I have stayed at the Park MGM and it did not disappoint. Our rooms were clean and comfortable. Absolutely loved breakfast at the Primrose! Dinner at Bavettes always a treat!  Every staff member was helpful customer service was outstanding. Oh my and the pool we were there daily! We attended the Usher concert and there was not one bad seat in the theater! I'm already looking forward to my next stay and I'm sure it will be within the next 6 months LOL.
50,Accessibility is great check in is a breeze with self-check in kiosks available restaurants are all really good and easy to reach simple gambling pit. Rooms are good enough. You'd be hard pressed to find a better deal on the strip!    La La Noodle is a legit Hong Kong / Cantonese wok restaurant (all the chefs are old school Canto). Oxtail fried rice was real good!
40,The staff at all levels were extremely friendly and helpful. The rooms are very nice as well. The two areas that could use some attention; 1) thermostats in rooms inaccurate; 2) a place to store clothes
40,Great location on the strip. Rooms are a bit garish. Our air conditioner went out in the early morning hours. We called the desk at 0900 for maintenance. Within 10 minutes Andres was there and fixed it quickly. He even explained what was wrong as he was fixing it. Such a nice man.  The hotel smells nice. I would definitely stay here again.
10,Water went out no electricity flickering lights when water came back on it was freezing. I was unable to take a hot bath which is my favorite thing to do while on vacation. Key was not working in elevator. All of these was not told to us by employee. Waited in a bell desk like for an hr and a half by the time we got to the front the room was ready. Finally got our virtual key only to be stuck in the elevator and walking around everywhere to connect to WiFi to get onto our floor. Finally when we got into our room to dress for the evening the water was off. I was unable to shower or brush my teeth before we went out. When I got back water was on but no hot water. It was absolutely freezing water. Our stay was totally unexpected and we were in Vegas for 24hrs thinking we were going to stay at the big time MGM hotel. We had a total different experience.
50,We love staying at Park MGM. It is the ONLY non-smoking casino. The staff was courteous and helpful. The casino was lively and there was plenty of gaming space. Food was great. Pool was great. Our room was comfortable with a decent view.
10,The hotel is very misrepresented on the site. The rooms look nothing like the pictures. The hallways are dark and creepy. The decor is odd. The rooms are small. No refrigerators or microwaves. Was overall very disappointed with this property. Not nice at all.
50,The entire staff went above and beyond the call of duty my entire stay! I was upgraded to a high floor when requested early check in was available for my early flight and the food was simply amazing at the various restaurants!    Antonio was extremely helpful at the check-in desk as well as Carla at the VIP desk. Also I had a small concern but Walter the manager was more than accommodating for that. I appreciate the helpful staff and will return in October to see Usher (again) for my birthday for sure!
50,Jon Berry works in the security department at Park MGM. I am here on business and just trying to get from point A to point B. Jon was extremely helpful and was very kind when giving directions.  Thank you Jon!
50,Park MGM is a great location. You can take the free train to Bellagio shops at crystal Vdara & aria. There’s bridges to mgm grand & access to Luxor NYNY Mandalay Bay & Excalibur. Hello Kitty cafe is right outside Park MGM.
40,We had an awesome time great stay! Rooms were clean and comfortable. Nice Casino. Hotel is right on the strip and close to a lot of fun attractions you can walk to. Rooms need a microwave and refrigerator but other then that we enjoyed our stay.
40,My overall experience was just ok. My room was not ready until midnight there was trash left laying in the hallway there was a water issue that had the hallway soaked and we had no water for about an hour during the middle of the day.
30,Walls paper thin. Connecting room door has space underneath doesn’t touch the floor. Positives The app was great to check in/out of the room. Digital door key worked great even in the elevators. Add physical address to parking structure for gps phone to help out of Towners
30,Overall a decent stay. Room upgrades are much needed. Microwave’s and mini fridges should be standard. Also maybe provide a map of the area. Being new to Vegas and having an idea of what is within distance would be a big help.
50,Had a great time loved the customer service casino and location. Plenty of food choices and nearby options. This will always be my choice for hotel stay. Not to mention the pool the staff there was very accommodating and polite.
50,My wife and I decided to do a quick getaway during the week while we are still on summer break. It was relaxing and Park MGM always made us feel right at home. We’ve always stayed here when we get the chance and it never lets us down. Definitely coming back!
40,The Park is centrally located on the strip. There are fewer dining options in the hotel than other MGM locations however. Eataly does have nice options for food however breakfast options are limited. The best thing is the Park is close enough to walk to other restaurants if neeed. Best Friend in the Park serves nice food but the music is too loud for conversations.
50,The Park MGM Hotel is a smoke free hotel and the staff was very courteous and helpful. The restaurant’s inside the hotel were excellent. We will definitely be back and highly recommend this hotel-casino
10,The suite we received looked nice in pictures but when we arrived it was the opposite. The room still had trash in it there were water stains on the nightstand a pillow had a stain on it there were cleaning materials left in the bathroom. The water was also turned off. The whole point of booking months ahead at this hotel was to get a connecting room to a suite. They put us on different floors. Even after the whole disappointing first night they didn’t try to help connect our rooms in any way. They told us to check again at 8am 1pm and then 430pm. They finally got us on the same floor but that was it. I will never stay there again.
40,For those of you that want to enjoy Las Vegas for the sights and sounds without the annoying smell of cigarette smoke this is the place for you! The entire hotel and casino is smoke-free. I can't believe in this day and age smoking is so prevalent indoors. We've been to Vegas many times in the past and didn't want to return because we're sick and tired of the smoking everywhere. Well the rest of Vegas is still smoky and gross but walking back in to the Park MGM from doing other Vegas things was always so refreshing. Rooms are a good size and there are quite a few food options. It's literally a 3 minute walk next door to New York New York for other more casual food options and you can't get closer to the arena if you're in town for a hockey game. The location is great and we could not have enjoyed our stay more. We will definitely be staying here again on our next Vegas adventure.
40,This was my first time staying at this hotel. I chose the Park MGM because its the location of the Usher concert. (Unfortunately I wasn't able to attend.)    This was my first time utilizing mobile check-in and it went smoothly. I had paid for an early check-in so I ended up at the front desk anyway. It went a simple process and we were able to check in very early and printed our own keys at the kiosk. Easy Peasy.    The room was unimpressive. We fortunately got a green room. I think a red room would have been too much for me. The room was very small. The bed was comfortable and the room was clean; however it was a minimalist room at best. Our particular room (07221) faced a building and a partial view of the NoMad pool area. Overall the room and bathroom were clean. There is no coffee maker or refrigerator in the room. It does; however have an ironing board and iron. There is also a mounted tv on a swing holder for viewing from the bed. There is a window seat that was comfortable and provided added seating. I do want to mention that the hallways to the room are very dark and uninviting.    The pool area was nice. There were several pools to choose from. We visited the 18 & up pool on multiple occasions. There was a bar and plenty of wait staff to attend to everyone. Plenty of towels and loungers were available as well.    The hotel itself was nice smoke-free and clean. It was easy to navigate through. What I enjoyed most was being able to walk out the door and being on the strip. There was a fly-over to the other side of the strip feet from the doors. I loved the food selections at the hotel as well. The Eately provided a variety of Italian food and great wine selections.    Overall this was a pleasant stay. I will visit again if I'm coming to Vegas to see a show at the Dolby Live venue.
50,Very beautiful property. Excellent place to stay if going to see the Usher show. The after party location is inside the hotel as well. The room was really nice with amazing views and a very comfortable bed.
50,Front check-in to check-out it is simple the food is amazing friendly staff and non-smoking is a huge bonus for me. I look forward to my return in December! The cleanliness is top-notch as well. I highly recommend checking it out.
50,So nice to stay at a hotel where there is no smoking and the air is so fresh. Great places to eat and greatest value on the Vegas Strip. Convenient tram to Bellagio shops Aria and close to many great casinos
40,Loved the ambiance and attention to detail. Felt like a secret garden fairytale. We also loved the smell each time we came in the door. Parking garage cleanest in town and easy to navigate. We love Eatily but feel there is nothing we can afford. The pool was fantastically relaxing!
50,I have never had a bad experience at Park MGM. THE SERVICE IS ALWAYS THE BEST the place is clean it is a smaller me free environment and there is enough to do around the location. I will always stay at Park. Mgm
50,It was clean and the check in staff were really nice. Checking in was quick and effortless. I went to the spa for a massage and everything went great. I loved my room and the view was great. The beds were comfortable and I really enjoyed my stay.
50,Non smoking great walking distance for pool desk parking coffee and food. Walkable and Close to other things on the strip and activities. Great . Clean and very friendly staff. Good prices. Nice to have shade at the pool.
50,My boyfriend and I had a fun time in the smoke free casino and really enjoyed Eataly! The hotel is centrally located on the strip which made it easy to visit the other casinos and restaurants and get some variety in our trip!
20,I stayed at Park this past week and my room was filthy. There was dust everywhere the carpet was not cleaned and the window sills were filthy. I dropped my phone behind the couch and there were used q tips on the floor. I was really disappointed this was my first time in Vegas.
30,In my opinion the very best things about this hotel is that it is non-smoking and the location. The rooms are decent for a quick trip. Walls are super thin we had a group of ladies next door to us and they were SUPER LOUD for hours.Felt like we were in the room with them. Also they don’t have fridges in any of the rooms. Apparently you can rent one not doing that. I will just pick another hotel. But to end on a positive note the hotel is SMOKE FREE!!
40,Overall this is a great place to stay. I would recommend it to all of my friends. The location of the Park MGM is great. You can get to the Aria and Cosmo easily! Also this makes for a great couples weekend!
50,Excellent location in middle of the las Vegas strip. Convenient tram to shopping and Bellagio. It has a great layout easy to find your way around the site. Very attentive pleasant and helpful staff.
20,water outage twice first at night. couldn't take a shower brush my teeth before go to bed. I thought it was done. but then the next day at 2pm the water was out again and I couldn't get ready and go out to enjoy the city. The worst case in this situation is no communications at all to the guests and both times I had to go down and find some uniform staff to ask for an update. No apologies from any of the staff that I talked to. That just made me sad.
50,Everything from valet to bell service to housekeeping was great! Room was good dealers were friendly and fun to play with and drink service was perfect. This was our second stay at Park MGM (out of MANY trips to Vegas) and will definitely be staying again.
50,Very  very nice hotel !!! Excellent location . Amazing service . The suite was very clean. The suite was a very good size  very spacious . Will definitely be returning and definitely very recommendable !! 💯❤️❤️
50,We overall had a great time the staff was great and friendly the rooms were clean. The location on the strip was prime. The only thing I feel that could’ve went better is the rewards program is a little slow to gain any rewards I spent close to $1000 and didn’t see any reward that I could reuse there.
10,NEVER AGAIN. Assigned a room via mobile checkin. Got in and realized NO WATER. No answer at front desk via phone so went downstairs and waited in the checkin line turns out there was a water leak and they shut off water to a few floors - our was impacted. Many people were commenting on the mess. Vanessa at the front desk was nice about it but there wasn't an ETA and nowhere to move us to. At this point we've driven hours to Vegas and just asked for a refund - which my cc company can't even verify for the refund (booked via points) because they won't answer the phone. By this time it was 2 AM and other hotels wanted to charge for the night trip already ruined so we drove all the way back home.    The front desk at a nearby MGM property was appalled we weren't offered a future comped room and said we should call to get compensated. At this point though it's not even worth coming back even for a comped stay. It would've been our first time and we don't ever plan to come back. The carpet in the room was dirty and the space just dark and cramped.
50,Long overdue I wish I came back sooner I wish I didn't stay away for so long but work had to keep me awake I have an amazing time and will continue to visit I'm still here it's the 16 days I haven't left yet since I got here I'm taking a nice little vacation oh I can use some free play since you guys want to be nice if I've been messing up to lose all my money laughing out loud but I've been having fun visiting different she knows different times I hope to visit soon again if I have any offers let me know thank you
20,Hotel tops out at average in all ways. A modest attempt to rebrand the old Monte Carlo. Didn’t bother updates the back of the building. The casino staff is offensive and off putting. Be wise and look for an alternative place to stay.
30,Cleanliness was the biggest issue I had during the stay. After checking out I’m now reviewing my cc statement and it’s showing more charges than expected. Room service was terrible. Food was cold and the person who answered was a rude.
30,On the plus side the beds were comfortable and the bathroom had been nicely redone. The shower was clean and had plenty of water pressure. The TV was nice and the icemaker worked well. The hair dryer didn't work but someone brought a new one pretty quickly.  However our room seemed dated and the furniture was old. The remote control needs batteries or to be replaced. We paid for a strip view and I feel like that phrase was misleading. We could view Target Olive Garden and the MGM Grand. It wasn't worth paying $40 more. The hallways were dark the carpet seemed dirty/dingy and wallpaper was peeling off in places. Plus the night before we checked out our hotel room had no water to shower or wash up.
50,I appreciated the casino being a smoke free environment. Even though I didn't gamble it was nice to not deal with second hand smoke. We attended the Usher concert at Dolby Live (which was AMAZING might I add). It was super convenient to just go down stairs to the venue. The tram was a nice amenity. It allowed us to travel to other hotels and shops on the strip.
50,Very nice hotel. Easy check in with the MGM app. Comfortable beds with plenty of pillows. Next to T Mobile Area for hockey and concerts. The new NFL stadium directly across the freeway. Non smoking hotel and casino is awesome.
50,Our first time staying in park mgm and Really love that it’s a non smoking hotel. Staffs are friendly and the room and clean and spacious.    Carpark is not far too. Overall pretty good experience will definitely come back to stay again.
30,Felt like I was sleeping in a toy room from the 50s. The height of bed and furniture was way too small if you are 5'10 or over. Each day my knees were hurting from sleeping in the bed. Tye mattress also wasn't comfy
10,Our room was filthy. Dirty drinking glasses with lips mark stain from previous guest dirty window and body soap was used. The decor of the hotel is outdated given the great location this hotel is at.
50,Great hotel! Highly recommend stay well room. Beautiful hotel/casino liked non-smoking facility. Can’t wait to return. Park Eatery was awesome and fun place to visit. Looking forward to participating in some upcoming tournaments!
50,The trip was amazing and clean I especially loved the no smoking regulations since second hand smoke affects my health.The room was amazing very decorated colorful and the shower was something else entirely. AMAZING!
50,Love this hotel great value for money a smoke free environment. The staff are always most helpful the rooms are very comfortable and quiet. The dining experience is excellent as you have many great choices. Highly recommend this hotel
40,The experience / stay was very good but I had a problem with no microwave around any where in the building. When we eat out and bring leftovers back to the room we could at least be able to warm it up. At least consider a microwave in a common area.
50,The most comfy beds! Hotel was kid friendly and not crazy packed. Checkin and luggage storage was easy and fast. Checked out and able to use the pool the rest of the day until plane left. Would definitely stay again!
30,Be careful when booking more than 1 room. They will charge everything to one card and even if they say rooms will be conjoining/same floor they probably won’t be. I booked months in advance and we still had to be 2 floors apart. Not convenient at all
40,Overall it was pleasant except for the loud neighbor who was coughing and throwing up at all hours which we could hear! Had to purchase ear plugs to sleep because him throwing up and coughing could be heard through the walls. The room we turned down as low as it could go (60) but still felt hot in the room and woke up sweating.
30,Staff and everyone was very friendly is at check in the only problem I didn’t like it was the room was so dusty all around the edges of the wall and the bathroom wall was dirty and stains besides that everything was good and I like the casino area is non smoking
50,Park MGM has great staff and is clean and smoke-free. We had a nice room that was clean and safe and quiet. Every night gave us a good night's sleep. The bed was comfortable and it was quiet during the time for sleep.
20,Room looked like it hadn’t been cleaned throughly in a long time. Carpet needed to be vacuumed and there was viable dust in the bathroom. This was my first time at this property and I definitely will not be returning.
50,The hotel is nice and clean and the staff are extremely friendly and knowledgeable. The hotel itself is very central and easy to walk to all the fun sites around.  It hosts many good + different shows.  If you are here to gamble there are options for everyone.
30,Cons: rugs stained and air conditioning did not work well.Dust on vents and walls. No coffee maker in rooms.  Pros: excellent location. Casino very nice. Eaterly restaurant area was good although pricey.
50,I stayed at the Park MGM to attend the Usher Concert. We had a very great time. The food was great the rooms were nice and the staff was nice. While at the hotel I participated in a complimentary craps lesson it was great. I will be staying at the hotel again.
40,Just checked out from the Park MGM after spending 4 nights there while attending a convention. Check in was a breeze line was not too long. You have the option to check in yourself at one of the iPads they have in the lobby. Hotel is located in the middle of the strip where you can walk to many different dining and shopping places. My room was a decent size with beautiful decor on the walls. Love the shower pressure in the bathroom. I stayed in room 4-310 which had a beautiful view of the T-Mobile arena. Only reason I didn’t give it a 5 start is due to the fact that carpet in hallways are a bit dirty and in need of a replacement. Other than that great hotel.
30,Not impressed people were really nice but did not come back my AC want working and when the maintenance came he pulled out the filter and it was filthy. The room was nice but it was missing ice bucket and towels.
40,Usher was awesome as usual! Only draw back about Dolby Live is the seating is not Thick Thigh Friendly. The convenience of staying at Park MGM i.e all the favorite places are with a 10 minute walk. I also enjoyed the adult only pool tremendously.
30,I have stayed at this property a few times prior and found it to be decent and clean as well as friendly & well placed or located. The issue on this stay was Smoke detector battery beeping after I was asleep Marijuana smell coming through the next door vent and a poor quality room phone which you couldn't hear anything. The room I was moved to was just tired cracked paint on the walls and failed sealing of the bathroom shower door allowing the floor to flood with water & only 1 towel provided to shower and clean this up. Staff was great rooms were NOT up to standard
30,This every year is our anniversary trip and this is the first year I’ve been disappointed with my room. I had to work with the person who checked us in he kept trying to put us in a room with two queen size beds told him that’s not how I want to spend my anniversary with my husband. And finally got a room with a king size bed but it was in my opinion below par.
40,We were just here overnight. Room was large and well equipped. Nice bathroom. Views over T-mobile arena and city beyond. Very busy hotel complex but couldn’t find fault. We used Primrose on casino level for breakfast and were happy with our choice.
50,We were visiting ParkMGM and I was suffering from blisters on my feet from too much Las Vegas walking when Hank G. from security came over and offered me several bandaids to ease my pain. He was so thoughtful he even threw in a couple extra for the next day! MGM Resorts is lucky to have this kind and dedicated gentleman!
50,Love that the entire place is smoke free! The food options were amazing and the pool was wonderful. Wish the slots were looser and wish the rooms had a fridge but other than that This is my new favorite Vegas hotel!
50,This was my first time here and I been to many hotels here in Vegas and I gotta say this has been the best experience ever for me will return here on my next visit well worth it wonderful staff Eataly amazinggggggg a must try if your in Vegas and rooms were very quiet and clean nice view and staff
50,I would recommend this casino to anyone and everyone it is small but great. This is a totally smoke free casino which I enjoy as a non smoker. The Park MGM offers a wide variety of food choices and small shops.
50,Center of the strip near outdoor escalator to cross street to last minute gift and snacks. Indoors as soon s you walk out from the elevators Starbucks is right there Eataly is near by and gambling well within walking distance from elevators. Ballroom Presidio was perfect for the event I attended as well .
50,Park MGM wowed me and my wife.  The staff was awesome rooms and casino were very clean the pools were great too.  we had planned to go out and do a many great things but we could not pull ourselves to leave the friendly confines of the hotel but we didnt need to. this hotel has all the amenities you could ask for.
50,Perfect location. Perfect Rooms. Delicious dining. Awesome concert venue. Great service! Smoke free. Awesome pools. This was one of my best vacations in Vegas we definitely stay at the Park Mgm again. Love the contactless room key and the ease of checking in and out.
40,Loved the location and cleanliness of room. No fridge and microwave tho- kinda weird for a new place. Easy mobile check in was nice and it was easy to navigate the inside of the casino. Not a maze inside.
40,Great location with easy access to all of the strip specifically Aria and Bellagio - both walking and by tram. Check-in was busy so use the app if possible. Check out the casual dining options at the front of the hotel.
50,Our stay really was perfect. This was just a quick little impromptu getaway and I’m so glad I chose this hotel. Clean beautiful staff was very nice and helpful. Will definitely be staying here again.
50,I purchased the VIP package for the Usher concert and had a great experience with the hotel its cleanliness and the professionalism of the staff from checking in at the VIP desk to housekeeping! Whether a concert or not I would highly recommend!
30,Checkin was hard because our room wasn’t available. Temporary room was dirty had to move again. My expensive purse also went missing even though it never left the room. However being a smoke free facility helps us want to come back though
40,although the price is kind a stiff the hotel in general is above average in cleanliness. The best thing is the smoke free hotel which means. the hotel itself smells good compare to any other hotels.
40,Cvs outside of Eataly. Good restaurants and bar/club venues. Can walk to Aria indoors. Friendly staff and easy to use mgm app. Only wish rooms had a mini fridge. Casino non smoking. Ate at Best Friend and went to Usher after party On the Record both very fun and would go again.
40,Be ready to pay $18 overnight/daily parking. Download MGM app prior to arriving. Parking pass on app was not being read at kiosk. This was holding up lanes to enter/exit  Perfect place to stay if going to event at Dolby live theater and T Mobile arena
50,Pleasantly surprised. Great experience. Loved that it was a no smoking environment! Food at the location was great there's even a 24 hour food option. Friendly staff clean rooms location of the property was very convenient. We'll be back in the future!
50,The hotel itself was already nice. Rooms are very spacious and the cleaning service is great. The best part of this hotel is the non smoking casino. You don’t have to worry about putting all your clothes into a separate bag because they reek of the smell of smoke. This is the only hotel I will be staying at from now on. This hotel also offers great restaurants. The Library’s ambiance was beautiful!
50,This is a great location which connects to City Center properties. Great food and entertainment options while being in a smoke free environment. There were plenty of gaming options as well if gambling is your thing. Worth the stay
50,Perfect location loved being central to most of the strip. Great room decent amount of floor space nice and clean. Good value I used MyVEGAS for 2 free nights and paid for the an additional 5 nights. A fully smoke free casino/property is a bonus!
50,Room was clean. Very nice accommodations location slot machines food options and entertainment. The bed was very comfortable. The toiletries were nice sometimes those can dry out your hair and your skin. Bathroom was spacious very clean plenty of towels. Automatic shade and curtains. Lots of outlets to charge your electronics. Table and chairs to eat by the window with a nice view.
50,We booked through Costco travel and I feel it was a good deal for the rooms. Simple rooms but got the job done. walk in showers beds were good views were pretty decent. the only issue was the walls are pretty thin.
50,This place is absolutely fantastic all starting from the fact that is non smoking casino and staff is very helpful and friendly  rooms are very clean and very spacious the 3 pools are phenomenal definitely coming back
40,Love the smoke-free Park MGM. Quieter (that's relative in Vegas) than other property. We had a strip view and it was not Bellagio (duh) but it was satisfactory. Loved the window seat where I could sit and relax. The biggest downside I can offer about the rooms are the THIN walls. The first night we we were awakened by loud thumping noises and a man shouting in Japanese Hai! Hai! Hai! (I am not making that up and either he was practicing martial arts or the world's oldest art....either way I didn't want to know or hear it.) The next night it was nonstop LOUD tv from the other room. It was very annoying and we didn't always sleep deeply as a result. Perhaps book the Nomad if noise bothers you.  Pools were quiet and relaxing though I could have like to have a few more umbrellas up in the summer heat. Having Eataly and Crack Shack nearby a bonus; my teenage son could get what he wanted when we went to dinner. Recommend going to the Nomad Library Bar--located inside the property great bartenders Also recommend Bavettes also located inside the property. ≈
50,Great location staff is very friendly and willing to help you during your stay and making sure you’re as comfortable as possible. Having The tram there helps a lot to travel faster when you don’t feel like walking. Having Eataly inside is another plus. Amazing food for breakfast lunch and dinner. The pastries and gelato are a must !
40,I have frequented this area for business over 10 times in just the last 6 months and I've stayed at this location several times. The proximity to good food and amenities as well as the ability to isolate and find a quiet space in just this location is great. The price is typically competitive and the hotel itself surpasses quality of others we've stayed at that are higher priced. I would recommend this place to others and specifically Bavette's. It's a fun restaurant they have there that has become my favorite go-to after work.
50,Perfect location convenient to central strip with the tram excellent front desk and pool service always have a spot at the pool. Don’t get the typical rowdy crowd. Non-smoking casino. Lots of choices to eat. Clean rooms.
50,We ended up here due to a basketball tournament. The stay at Park MGM especially the military benefit made it the most reasonable for the best value. Military Parking cards were a little confusing (didn’t always work) but other than that great experience overall!
30,I can’t speak for the other rooms but my room was very out dated. The bed was very low to the floor and the main light fixture and the bed side lights were dated. If the rooms were updated I would definitely return.
50,Overall great experience but our bed was not that comfortable the mattress had a dip and was uncomfortable we also asked for Fowler paper to be brought up to our room the last night before leaving and the toilet paper was never brought to us. Still an overall great experience
50,Property is clean and being smoke free was an added bonus. The property was easy to navigate friendly staff and the strip was easy to get to from Eataly. We enjoyed food from Eataly and Side Betty Grill. The pools were relaxing and quiet
50,Clean Quiet and friendly. Quite a difference from the other strip hotels. Park is the secret  still close to everything without the hustle and bustle. Tram to aria and bellagio was nice and new york is right next door.
40,The Park MGM is a solid choice if you are looking for a hotel with good restaurants modern decor and good customer service/ employees seem to like their jobs. The only downside is that the walls are paper thin (not exaggerating). I could here the neighbors cell phone alarm and them having a general conversation. Thankfully they weren't loud and didn't stay up late.
30,I greatly appreciate that this property is completely smoke-free. Eataly has many great food and drink options. Aria is connected via walkway (and tram) and the Bellagio via tram.    The only downside is that the actual hotel rooms suffer from poor design and can be noisy depending on your neighbors and people in the hallway. You should not be able to hear a breakup and two-hour phone conversation in the next room (not the room connected by door; the one that apparently shares a vent).    The casino property and restaurants are great. La La Noodle is wonderful. However I will think twice about staying here as other hotels do not have noise issues to this degree.
50,"The hotel has an exclusive boutique feel; where everyone treats you like a VIP. Here you'll enjoy shorter lines at restaurants pool lounges close to the pool so even if you don't get into the pool you can still enjoy being ""poolside."" It's a smoke-free environment which is great for those of us who suffer with respiratory challenges. Great value for your money!"
50,Me and my wife had a little get away to Vegas. We saw Usher there and stay for 3 nights. Loved it and everything about it.  Casino had a good variety of tables and the staff was extremely professional but nice. Great convo s with everyone we interacted with.
50,You can’t find a more central location on the strip. Great hotel experience and being smoke free is a real plus. The casino was about average. Having all the food choices was great. Enjoyed the pool a lot.
40,The service was great. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The rooms are very spacious and comfortable. I was on the 27th floor and the views were excellent! I would definitely stay at Park MGM again. Guests can use the amenities to their other properties MGM Bellagio and Aria.
10,Upon arrival the bathroom sink was dirty with black smudges and paint inside of it. The couch looked like it had been vacuumed but the arms and back near the window were completely dusty. I’ve stayed here before and haven’t had this issue but this time it wasn’t great.
20,Casino floor is great. Spacious and great variety of games. The hotel is dimly lit dirty and run down. The floor plan in the Nightengale Suite makes no sense and was poorly put together. The elevators are small and usually a few are broken or have long queues to get to your room during peak hours. The only food on property worth anything is Eataly. MGM seems to have given up hope on this establishment.
50,Enjoyed my time at Park MGM during Usher’s second residency. I can’t wait to return. Was able to check in early. Ate delicious food at Noodle restaurant and was just steps from the Dolby live theater.
50,We stayed here for 2 nights in April to watch BTS. It's a huge hotel but check in was quick and easy the rooms were ready when we arrived. Huge beautiful rooms with big windows wonderful bathroom.    The location is great and you can walk to anywhere on the Strip. Because it's an MGM hotel they also allow you to park in any MGM hotel in Las Vegas for free if you just show your room key card.    Have breakfast at the Primrose restaurant at the ground floor They have the best avocado toast in the world!
50,I love staying at the Park MGM. It’s not as crazy or big as the other casinos which I love because it feels like an oasis in the middle of the Strip. And the Pina Coladas at the East pool are the best!
50,Had a wonderful stay at Park MGM. Love the smoke free location definitely nice to get a break from the smog in the rest of Vegas. Best Friend served up the best meal I've ever had in Las Vegas I would strongly recommend a stop there whether you stay at Park MGM or not.
30,Positive notes: very friendly staff Restaurants (esp Eataly and Bavette’s) Tram service to other hotels smoke-free property.    Negatives: noise carried so much that you could hear those next door opening blinds pool closed at 7pm in July when there were lights in the pool! We understand that they want people to gamble at night but some people enjoy a swim after dinner.
40,overall good experience  halls leading to rooms are grungy looking. hall waiting area for elevators is hot. nice club and concert area. good food options. friendly staff. easy check in. cool pool area. acces to 2 pools
50,Place was great  very clean  checking process super easy staff ready to help. The location is as great have a lot of stores around and casinos. What I liked most is smoke free environment. Totally awesome
50,We stayed at the Park MGM for my cousins wedding and it was an absolute great experience. The room was clean and roomy the food was delicious and had about every amenity you could think of ! Definitely recommend saying here 10/10!!
40,We to Las Vegas for a Hair Show. Stayed at Park MGM because it a non smoking property. Our room was ok . No mini bar. The beds were good. Bathroom and shower was nice. I will give a shout out to the front desk and bell desk. It was a fun time. We enjoyed our time .
20,Disappointed in the staff friendliness and overall cleanliness. For being somewhat newly renovated we expected more. Eataly was the best part since it’s close by but closes early for Vegas. Really no nearby late night eating spots.
50,The price was right. I was there for my birthday to see the Usher concert which was phenomenal. I had the best birthday since a long time ago. The Usher after party was excellent. I got to take memorable pictures with some of his dancers. That was awesome! Thank you Park MGM for accommodating me and making my birthday experience one that I will never forget! Last but not least the Casino got me some winnings as well👍👌🙏❤️🤣. I will be back. Please make available some great benefits for returning guest🙏🙏🙏thank you again!!!
30,I question the validity of most of these reviews. This hotel is not 4 or 5 stars. It's a solid 3. That's not too say it's a bad place it's just not high quality. It's about the same as a Holiday Inn. The room is extremely small with absolutely no storage. The closet is more like an armoire. It's not even deep enough for a hanger. Clothes have to be hanged horizontally. There is no dresser or anywhere to put your shirts and pants. We lived out of our suitcase kept on the sofa. The bathroom is also very small with no storage. They keep the towels on top of the small vanity. The hair dryer is in the armoire/closet. Our bathroom had a very dingy small tub shower combo. The tub was stained and water leaked out from the shower into the vanity area from somewhere under the tub. The decor was lacking. There is a light fixture with conduit running along the wall and plugged in to an outlet (tacky). Carpet in room and hallways are worn and stained. The pool is very basic. It looks like a public pool not a resort pool. It doesn't stand up to pools at other resorts we've visited in Vegas. When we stayed at this hotel as Monte Carlo it was much better. The Good: The non smoking aspect was the saving grace for this hotel. I really enjoyed not having smoke blown in my face or having to shower before bed to get the smoke smell out of my hair. All the employees were all VERY friendly. The restaurant options were very good and we enjoyed our meals at Primrose and Eataly as well as great drinks at Nomad bar. Bottom line We might visit the casino again but we will NEVER book rooms here. They lack quality.
30,Zero coordination with the security at the hotel. No one knew what was happening - mad chaos people fleeing running knocking others over. We had no clue what was going on for at least 30 minutes. People were screaming about someone with a gun at the casino and hotel. How terrifying is that? And the hotel did nothing afterwards to see if people were ok.
30,This rating of 3 stars ✨ s in comparison to other hotels on the strip. This hotel provided excellent customer service and the location is excellent. Hotel carpet throughout looked worn but didn’t smell. Rooms were comfortable and spacious no complaints!!! Slot machines are tight.
50,Upon arrival our room that we requested wasn’t available so they gave us an upgrade although the room didn’t have two beds it did have a pull-out bed from the couch and it was super comfortable. They also waived the resort fees for the inconvenience which was the cherry on top.  The hotel is conveniently situated on the strip which means you’re close to most attractions and events. We went to see Usher’s Vegas residency and the Dolby Theater is right at the hotel. The after party at the hotel nightclub On the Record was so fun the ambiance was great the bartenders aren’t rude at all and the music was excellent. The rooms are located in the center of the hotel so you’re not walking to the end of the earth trying to get out of the hotel or to the casino or anywhere else which is a huge deal. They also have a tram that connects you to the other MGM hotels like the Bellagio so you don’t have to walk too far to get anywhere. The staff was super nice and accommodating as the hotel environment has a great modern feel to it. Definitely recommend and would stay here every time I visit Vegas.
20,Rooms are below average and service was really lacking. Does not feel like a high end property - except for Eataly - which anyone can access. Our room was never cleaned and staff generally seemed annoyed to be working there. No exceptional service experiences (except for Valet). Would not stay again. If you want an exceptional service experience/luxury property opt for the Wynn.
40,Stayed at the park for 5 nights in July. I was unable to use the app to check in prior to arrival (would not verify my ID) but was approached by a helpful staff member who was able to send me a link. From this it was extremely easy to complete the check in and print cards without standing in line. Rooms were small but very clean .    Biggest complaint would be a lack of coffee makers in the room or a bar fridge to keep water cold. I understand that they want you to buy from Starbucks or the restaurant downstairs but I think this small added touch would set them apart from similar hotels on the strip. This was the biggest grumbling I heard while waiting in the Starbucks line.    We appreciated the smoke free hotel and pool area. Servers at the pool were friendly and prompt and always smiling despite the record breaking temperature.    Hotel is well positioned on the strip with easy access to the free tram to Shops at Crystals and Bellagio when we ventured from the hotel. If you are headed to a Knights game it is ideal as the arena is within a 5 minute walk.    Would stay here again and recommend to others .
20,From beginning to end the communication was distorted speaking with management teams to speaking with wrong departments who transfer you all over the different buildings it was a disaster I have never had this type of customer service there was one female that continued to give me the politeness the courtesy her name was Vanessa she did an amazing job of trying to do her best to satisfy a customer who had several uncomplicated issues that the hotel made complicated I myself have been to Vegas on several different times and I've never had this poor customer service not to say I went because my boyfriend could only make this time because this is the only time of year off we went in the heat of the summer I came back with covid. My Rewards told me I would get certain nights off but based on the nights it changed through conversation there's so much more that I can say but if you're looking to have an amazing time and spend a beautiful adult time in Vegas find a hotel that gives you every luxury you need completely effortless stress and a beautiful time I've stayed in plenty of other ones but because Usher was there it made it all worth that time his concert was amazing the after-party was amazing but other than that the customer service in the hotel itself was lacking the people were very and engaged the senior manager who have access to speak to Scott I've been told he would reach out to me and I have not gotten a call as of yet I am now almost over covid and waiting for a call I've only spoke with Vanessa who is continuing to be the most reliable person at this hotel that I've been able to speak to I cannot believe it if I ever go back there and I decide to stay there again I would stay there under the pretenses that things will be different but I don't think so I think my next trip to Vegas will be the same hotels I've stayed in before where they welcome you with open arms and you feel the customer service and the experience which you should thank you for listening this may not be your experience this was me and my experience at the park MGM Las Vegas.
50,Clean rooms great staff love the no smoking Will be back in December to see George Strait at the T-Mobile arena Super fast and easy check in love the pool area love the location of the hotel close to everything
50,Once I found out they were a non smoking hotel I was sold. And they did not disappoint the staff was great. The bed was extremely comfortable and the temperature of the room was perfect. I don't think I could have asked for anything else to be honest.
50,It was a fun time. The rooms are big and spacious. Only issue was working the digital keys. Reception was spotty especially in the parking garage but it was easy to get keys to use from the front desk.
50,Another great stay. Staff St the Park are very helpful and friendly. Smoke free environment is the best. Cashier staff was very helpful and courteous.  Table games are limited. Close to other MGM properties.
20,Not worth staying here. Very old dark and dirty rooms and hallways. Terrible check in process with 2-3 people working at desk. It literally took them 25 minutes to check in 1 guest. Almost everything besides the casino closes at 10pm. It is too bad because the hotel is in a good location and casino is smoke free which is nice.
50,Traveled to Vegas to see Usher with my friends over the weekend. Park MGM was great from the check-in to check out. I love the mobile check in and being able to have my room information upon arrival. Great stay. The only weird thing is that the rooms do not have microwaves.
50,Resort service and staff were wonderful! Hotel facilities were clean and up-to-date! I love the citrus-smelling non-smoking casino! I had a customer concern from a previous trip that was promptly resolved by Sean Burras and his day shift casino crew. My girlfriends and I attended the Usher concert and give it 10/10 stars! The service given at the pool cabana was outstanding; especially by massage therapist Ramon who gave the best back rubs to our over-worked Mom group. I highly recommend Park MGM for all your Vegas needs! Can’t wait to come back!
50,Great location great food options and friendly staff. Would highly recommend Eataly and Bavette Steakhouse. We had excellent food and service at both places. My favorite thing about this hotel is that it is smoke free!
50,My Wife and I have stayed here many times the Casino is Non-Smoking and the Facility is super clean rooms are comfortable and the Restaurants are good Bavette's steakhouse was great and the Good Friends Restaurant has great food.
50,The stay was pretty good & the staff was very professional. Tanisha was very helpful Veronica was nice and very detailed about what I needed help with. Vanessa the housekeeper was friendly and didn’t mind cleaning up my room.
20,The lobby and casino are nice. The rooms are terrible; outdated and depressing items broken such as safe and cabinet below tv. Stains on the carpet. Wasn’t impressed. Maybe their other resort rooms are better?… Felt like we were staying in a dirty motel room.
50,We were just taken aback at how amazing Park mgm was. They really took care of us made sure that our stay was comfortable and easy! We had a minor draining problem with our sinks and they were fixed immediately and gave us a good credit for our troubles. Overall a great place to stay!
50,I liked the new location & new style of decor. I liked that it was now a no smoking hotel. I did have trouble with my mobile room key & had to go to the front desk for help but a kind lady who looked like possibly a manager helped me and my family out with showing us how to print a key card and I appreciate her.
30,Enjoyed our time. Show was great and restaurants were awesome. Accessible to the strip shopping and outside attractions. Can’t wait to get back and enjoy some rewards discounts and activities along the strip.
50,First arriving the hotel was beautiful clean and smelled fresh. Mobile check-in came in handy. Usher was performing downstairs decent casino Eataly had delicious food and my son could not get out the bed; he loved it so much! Not to mention we were in walking distance to the stuff we wanted to see and the bus stop was right in front. Will be coming back!
50,I had a wonderful first time at this resort! Also great guest service they were friendly and very helpful! The pool and all amenities were very clean and so we’re our rooms beds and pillows very comfy we slept soundly!
30,We chose a king strip view room. As the rooms are quite far back from the strip you don’t get much of a ‘view’ but the room itself was nice enough. Not particularly clean and you can sometimes hear voices through the walls but it was fine for what we needed.  We arrived Saturday. Our room was not serviced Sunday nor Monday.  We went to reception (Monday 5pm) and was told by Cesar that daily housekeeping is “not a thing in Vegas” - he said ‘you have to request it each day’. (News to us we’ve been to Vegas four times previous and never had to request it.) We were told they were very busy with a conference and so if we wanted our room serviced we had to call reception each day by 9am.  I said we hadn’t been told this on arrival.  The lady (Ashley) beside Cesar said If it was up to her she would credit us two resort fees. We asked Cesar if he could do that and he simply refused. He said and I quote “I’m just gonna let it be”… so we moved across the counter to Ashley who credited us (2) resort fees.  Such a terrible response from Cesar. He needs a lesson in customer service.    However on a positive note we met a lovely staff member who after finding out it was my husbands 60th birthday (and we’d come all the way from NZ) gave us a meal voucher. We also got a bottle of wine sent to our room. Thank you Suri Garcia. Exceptional service.    The casino is small but the non smoking is great. Lala noodle is really good we dined there five times.  Probably wouldn’t stay again but it suited our needs this time (we had family with us) and is in a good location.  The pool was nice and staff at the pool bar really good.  Thanks again Suri for being so kind.
10,False advertisement.    I booked a room that had beautiful pictures including an updated couch area beautiful king bed and updated bathroom. I arrived to a room that had an outdated chair set with a random table popcorn ceiling and a bathroom straight from a retirement home (or psych ward… or public gym?). Like literally the shower curtain was so thin that it was like the cheapest option they could find in Walmart.  On top of that there was one ply toilet paper and the roughest towels ever.    I brought my boyfriend here for his birthday and when we got off the elevator I was so embarrassed. The darkest most sinister hallway leading to a motel 6 room.    I tried to stay positive but it got worse.    There was an active shooter scare on the second day I was there (Saturday July 18) and though I know there was nothing the hotel could do about this their response was horrible. The only way I found out there was an emergency was because there were people running and crying as I was leaving my hotel room to go down to the casino. The people (not staff) told me to get back into my room to get to safety and alerted me of an active shooter. Me and my boyfriend ended up staying put in our room for hours thinking at some point we’d get an alert from the apparent speaker/intercom system I see in the wall of the room. Unfortunately the hotel never even said ANYTHING about a threat. Thank god it was a false alarm or I could have unknowingly walked into danger. Unfortunately I did miss out on hours of doing things because of the lack of communication.    The cherry on top — on my third day no cleaning service to my room.    The only redeeming quality about the hotel are the restaurants.
50,Nice hotel clean and quiet to sleep loved the smoke free casino it has a great location and also you can take the tram to go to other hotels. Nice decoration recently renewed. It is connected to eataly to find very good food.  I didn't know I have to ask for a parking card so after checking inn and realize that situation and seing the very long line I went to the vip line were they helped me. Staff was very helpful.
10,I did stay at Nomad a while back- I'm not sure if these are a part of the amenities provided by them.    Also at Park MGM as a platinum member I have requested the upgrade late checkout    mgmresorts com mgm-rewards    They had no idea what I was talking about. They lied straight to my face that there are no late checkouts available. You can check the video at the front desk.
30,For years I would walk by this hotel and I finally said I would upgrade my experience on next trip. Well I did but it was no upgrade. No friendly staff no winning people just a punch of Nicole diving for everything including a cup of hot water at Eatily for $5.20 small cup with room service for $3.00.
30,Overall it was okay. Don’t think I will stay there again. Bed a bit too soft for my back. Missing basics in the room like coffee machine frig. microwave.  Staff was friendly though. Check in and check out was easy.
40,Perfect location! Concert was in same Hotel. Park MGM  Conveniently located to just have a NICE dinner at Bavette’s Steakhouse and walk downstairs after for an AMAZING USHER Concert ! Dance after at On the Record !!
50,This was an anniversary family vacation. There were 10 of us that all stayed at Park MGM. We had so much fun playing with the slots eating at LaLa Noodle and Eataly. The rooms were excellent especially the shower. We all had a blast! We will surely go back soon!
50,The best sleep I’ve ever had. Located right on the Vegas strip so it’s close to many shops and restaurants. Pleasant and friendly staff anywhere you go in the hotel. I’d definitely recommend anyone to come stay here. Not only will you get a warm greeting at check in but you will get a quality price and an amazing experience over all.
50,The king size bed room was very nice. It had a long red sofa against the window wall with a view to the pool. The bathroom was gorgeous with red and white tile which gave it a very clean look. The non-smoking hotel was a great accommodation and helped with our breathing and was a big plus to also not have our hair or clothes smelling like cigarette smoke.
50,Very nice and quaint hotel. People were friendly and the location is convenient to everything. Nice restaurants and casino was always clean. The pool was very nice as well. 3 pools and 1 was adults only so it was nice not having kids splashing around.
50,Excellent for family. Enjoyed the pool although small. Wish they could close a little later like 9pm. The MGM is located walking distance of the strip. You can find lots of eating locations nearby. The price to stay is also very reasonable.
50,The Park MGM & Nomad are perfect for concert weekend. Access to Tram is convenient. The location is also desirable. Very clean and above average personnel and staff. I will definitely stay again. If you are traveling fir a show stay here. Also sign up for MGM rewards and download the app. Go to Dolby Theater Live & the after parties at Iff-The-Record. The Lady Gaga costume museum is nice as well.
20,"My reservation was for NoMad. After a long delay I was told that there were no rooms available and I was assigned to Park MGM. The assigned room was musty and reeked of cigarette odor. I was given a different room which also reeked of cigarette odor. I was told that I was lucky that it didn't smell like marijuana. The hand towels were wet before I even used them. The sink area and the table in the room had black stains. The water coming out of the faucet was heavily chlorinated. The drainage in the sink gurgled and so I didn't bother with the shower afraid that it would back up. The mattress is thin and uncomfortable. The hotel presents itself as a ""luxury hotel"" but there are no slippers no mini fridge no notepad and no pen. The hand soap and lotion is low quality and dries the hands. So no I will not be staying at this hotel again."
40,"Staff at Park MGM was very welcoming and accommodating during my entire stay and always eager to assist with any questions or concerns. Had some hiccups with check-in but front desk was very helpful with troubleshooting.    This property is just the right size making it easy to navigate and not get lost in the casino with plenty of eateries to choose from but still very conveniently located centrally on the Strip for other food options.    The ground floor lobby of the property is beautiful and modern chic but the hotel floors and rooms were not as nice as I'd hoped for a newly renovated property. My suite looked like it was struggling to find its identity - straddling somewhere between a ""higher end"" motel room and a boutique hotel I was a little disappointed. The room and floor hallways were very dark and dimly lit with soiled carpet that has seen way too much love. Beds were very comfy and clean but room furniture looked a bit old dated and dusty. Would have liked a mini fridge and coffee machine in the room.    Downstairs there are three pools for Park MGM guests with food & drink service complementary mini water bottles and unlimited towels. Go early to secure a shaded recliner - there are a few available without a reservation but first come first serve.    I did love that the casino and property is 100% smoke free so for that alone and the outstanding customer service from beginning to end I'd consider staying here again if discounted room rates were available."
50,Overall had a great time and great anniversary  already planning our return trip hopefully we will win a little more next time 😜😁 and the primrose great great food and servive some of the best oat meal I have had even better than mom would make😲😲
30,Bait and switch…..Website says spacious shower photo is a walk in tiled shower with glass enclosure but what you will actually get is a small bathtub with cheap shower curtains. They should have disclosure informing customers that not all rooms were renovated and you might get one that’s dated….  Other than that bed and pillows are very comfy. Love that it’s a non smoking hotel convenient tram connection to Bellagio.
10,Staff did not care when we were caught in the stampedes that took place. My sister needed medical attention and the staff was not genuinely willing to help. On top of that our room was dirty and we had people clothes left in our room from the previous stay.
50,Great hotel great location clean rooms I love the pool and easy to get around. Not a huge hotel so it’s perfect!!!! I highly recommend this hotel. I will be there in the fall again and will definitely stay there!!!
50,the ParkMGM is a great place to stay if you want a smoke free place center strip with lots of food options and 3 very nice pools. the rooms are nice and the casino is fun!!! would for recommend the place to anyone and look forward to coming back!!!
40,Great hotel but the rooms are not all as advertised . We booked Park King with a large shower but the room came with a small tub shower. They said they could not move us to a room that we booked because they were sold out even though we were there for 6 nights. We eventually had to pay for an upgraded suite out of our own pocket to fix the situation. Beautiful hotel but the room situation made the stay not as enjoyable.
50,Here at Park these guys are truly VIP  Treated me like family more then a customer. Thank you guys I would suggest this location for anyone coming to Las Vegas. Staff was great service was great very clean.
50,Park MGM is a beautiful hotel and casino that is smoke-free. This allows you to enjoy the ambience and scent of the hotel casino and bars:restaurants that are on property. The remodeling of the building is absolutely beautiful with modern and natural touches.
10,Rooms were extremely dirty its seemed like they had not been cleaned in weeks. The carpets were so dirty obviously not vacuumed in weeks. Both elevators hallways and rooms.  The rooms were so dusty i mean so dusty you can se it from feet away. So disgusting immediately my allergies were out of control. Put it this way there was so much dust it was build ontop of eachother.  The sink and shower kept getting clogged.  The most horrible experience!!!!!    Then i go to the small shop they have downstairs their apple pay never works and they are rude.    Only good thing there was there restaurants!
40,The Park MGM is very easy to get to from the airport and they have a great Eataly available for a bite.  I was there for a company conference and the conference staff was very helpful and attentive.  A special shout out to Carolina on the convention catering staff. She called everyone by name (we were all wearing name tags so it was a nice extra effort to read them) and was very helpful in getting the room opened up for a special lunch and breakfast set up we had for specific meetings.
40,The location was amazing so many other properties within walking distance. The casino and hotel were very clean which I would expect from a non smoking property. The only negative was at times the lines for the guest elevators could be very long.
50,Great experience more like a boutique hotel than a Vegas monster! Everyone was very nice and helpful. Room was just the right size comfortable bed and great shower a nice view of the strip. Casino was not huge but well equipped. Loved the Italian themed food choices all were excellent. Pools were very nice with lot of servers to keep the drinks flowing. The only reason we booked Park was the Aerosmith concert that got cancelled but I’m glad we did! Did I mention the no smoking that was AWSOME! 👍👍👍
30,My room key never worked in the parking garage and my coffee table was covered in dust.. The front desk did refund my resort fees but in a covid environment having a room that wasn't clean was an issue.
30,They had done a beautiful job with casino area and lobby and restaurants but the room itself felt dingy and like it had gotten a just ok remodel since being changed from Monte Carlo. Hallways to rooms felt dark too like they were hiding the dirt.
50,This is the only non-smoking hotel and casino on the strip!  It's small and has great staff members throughout the property. The Eataly has our favorite places to eat and drink. They also have a tram to Aria and Bellagio.
40,First time in Vegas and we stayed in a NightHawk suite during our week long stay (we paid extra money to get this). Check in was pretty easy other than the queues but that's to be expected. Another extortionate resort fee to pay at $44 a night. No idea why they cannot add this to the price of the stay would just be easier. They also take a $400 security deposit on check in which was never mentioned also. The hotel itself could do with new carpeting and new lighting.    The room itself has a great big shower and comfortable bed. Fridges for the NightHawk suites are free upon request so that was a godsend in the heat. AC worked extremely well and wasn't confusing like most other hotels. The walk in closet was a great housing area for the suitcases so the room wasn't clogged. There was two TVs and a couch it was strange having two TVs in a double room not sure what that was achieving and it wasn't beneficial. Towels were sent to our room whenever we asked. All staff were very friendly. My one issue with the room is that there is a random door in the room that connects to the next room. It opens and it has a concrete wall behind it. But as soon as someone checked in the next room you could clearly hear every word they spoke. They weren't even shouting. When asking the desk what could we do they offered to change room but couldn't guarantee it wouldn't happen again. Luckily it was only for an hour or two and the room was empty again. Can imagine it a pain if they were for the full week.    We never ate in the hotel as we liked to eat down the strip so we can enjoy the night life as well.    The hotel itself is on the strip close to a TargetWalgreens and CVS pharmacy. Plenty of restaurants around. Hard rock cafe olive garden and shake shack(personal Favourite) across the street. If you buy anything in the hotel shop be prepared to buy the high high end for low end products that you would get in the above shops.    Strip is an easy walk. We did it most days. Anything like Fremont Street or downtown Uber is your friend. Uber is fantastic in Vegas. It is not expensive and all the drivers we had were fantastic. When it came to the strip we mostly walked or used the monorail which you can grab at the MGM Grand and most hotels down the strip it was $45 each for 7 days. This can take you from the bottom of the strip to the top and vice versa. MGM grand 10 min walk from Park is the closest monorail station.    Overall we really enjoyed our stay and the hotel delivered for us. Other than the noise issue we see no reason not to stay there again.
40,This is a great hotel to stay in especially if you are seeing a show there super convenient. The hotel was clean and the staff friendly and helpful. Not modern/new more old Hollywood feel to the rooms. The double queen with a Strip view does not have a mini fridge that comes with the room. also the table in the room only had one chair but there was a couch. The rooms were clean if dated. Eatly is really good and in the hotel so nice food options without leaving. It has 3 pools which is nice. Also apparently Park MGM and the Nomad are two different hotels but in the same building. You can walk thru to the Aria and catch the Tram which is nice since it is not centrally located on the strip. Just across the street from Target Ross Shake Shack CVS etc.
50,Nice surprise recommendation from a friend to stay at the Park MGM and we are so glad we took her advice. Loved that the facility is 100% smoke free! You really notice how bad the other hotels are when moving about the strip. The beds were really comfortable and the shower pressure was fantastic and we were on the 17th floor. Only thing we wished the room had was a mini refrigerator. Lots of great places to eat at the hotel and nearby too. Would definitely go back.
20,It just wasn’t what we thought it would be. Out of all the connecting hotels this by far was the worse. This was my first time staying at this hotel and the last for sure! Very dissatisfied and would definitely choose another hotel in the area moving forward.
40,The location is perfect. The resort is located minutes away from everything. The view was great. The security not so great. Had an alleged active shooter at New York New York next door. Park MGM was evacuated but guest didn't have anywhere to go. The resort does not have an emergency safety plan.
20,The room was dark old and smelly. Chairs were severely stained. Not a good vibe. Hotel staff did not go above and beyond to make matters better was told that they were sold out and they could only spray the room. Was told we wouldn’t be given a refund if we checked out.
50,"The hotel was nice without being too ""extra"". Will come back for sure. My only small annoyance is that the beds were not particularly comfortable but that's a matter of personal preference and could be different for someone else."
20,The room was small and had no refrigerator or ice bucket. The digital key didn’t always work which could trap you in the elevator until you returned to casino level. The hostess at the lobby restaurant was incompetent and rude (blamed us for her mistake). Then after waiting 40 minutes for a table sat us in the bar which was open seating.
30,Arrived late June 2022 to the ParkMGM. This used to be the Monte Carlo. Standard fee from the airport in a cab to the hotels begins at $26-30 USD there is no negotiation. You may get a better deal with Uber. The hotel is situated beside T-Mobile Arena and the Dolby. Check in was quick staff was friendly. The young man although didn’t explain where anything was in the hotel meaning…fitness centre pool restaurants maid service etc. once past the lobby you can see the age of the hotel. It has very dark walls/wallpaper dingy dark carpeting. Elevators look their age as well. We were on the 15th floor. The minute the doors opened from the elevator that horrible dark stained looking carpet was really apparent and those horrible really really dark hallways. The lighting is so bad that is almost seems dangerous. It’s also difficult to see the room numbers. Entering the room clean but again with the dark colours in the entrance with the ceiling painted the same dark red colour. Bathroom clean storage is a steel shelving unit but that’s for towels and the hair dryer. The counter is a small one sink with only a little storage on the top. Beds comfy enough and clean pillows are not great but clean. It has an old dated round table with one chair that completely takes up too much room. It also has this ridiculous “window couch” that is not practical except to hold our suitcases. There were a few stains on it and we refused to sit on that velvety seat. Window was very small and quite dirty on the outside. Lighting is not great on the room very dark until you turn every light on! Maid staff was great though and very on the floor everyday cleaning rooms! The small store in the lobby for snack and drinks doesn’t show any prices. That’s the first clue. A Diet Pepsi 1 litre bottle $6.75 USD! Starbucks was also crazy pricing. Across the street few minutes away is Target. This store has a small grocery section with fresh food fruit sandwiches alcohol and juices milk etc. many people were walking over and bringing food back. Apparently you can “rent” a small fridge for your room. I’m not sure if the price. One guest said $20 USD/day but you would have to confirm that price. Denny’s across the street also has takeout and is much cheaper. If you are looking for shopping the Fashion Mall is North on the strip we enjoy walking but it’s a hike. We made the mistake of taking the Deuce to the North Outlet Mall. Never again!! Bus driver was very unpleasant. It was a combination of screaming homeless people to ones high on drugs. It was obvious we were tourists and were not welcome. There’s racism on BOTH sides…I will leave it at that. Cab was the only way back.  The fitness room is excellent lots of equipment. The pool are is great the North one is the best. Lots of chairs and towels. Go down early just before it opens and stand in line to get in when they open the gates to secure your chairs and umbrella. Staff is great. Small water bottles in coolers are free for guests. The bar has filtered water that you can get as well. Didn’t eat at the Eatery as it was crazy busy and I’ve read mixed reviews on this place.  Finally my husband and I wouldn’t stay here again but that’s just us. Would I recommend…maybe but I would also give the above explanation. Staff is friendly and great rooms are very clean maids are great but we will go elsewhere…we like newer hotels. We have stayed at Wynn several times and loved it but was sold out (we booked too late). We also tried to book the new World Resorts by Hilton sold out. We would rather be in the Wynn area obviously not as trashy as around ParkMGM. Park MGM is located central near a lot of things we just didn’t like that drunken party atmosphere.
30,This was my first non-Disney pandemic trip. So I was quite nervous about traveling. Many staff in the hotel did not wear masks. I noticed housekeeping did not wear masks so I didn’t have my room serviced during my whole visit. Otherwise the staff were very friendly.  I was in that panic in the hotel last Saturday night. There was only one staff member that was guiding us away from our rooms. We wanted to go up to our room and get to safety. There was no announcement no call or texts to inform us what to do. The security guards were no where to be seen. There was no staff at the doors. There was no staff at the elevators. When I headed up to my room and got out of the elevator I literally ran to my room and locked the doors and closed the blinds. There was no announcement on the television. I am glad everyone was safe. But there were people who fell while running out of the hotel. There was an elderly woman that didn’t know what to do—so we guided her with us out into the street. I hope in the future there will be improved contingency plans for emergencies like this.
50,On my third visit to the Park MGM I had another great experience. Thanks in large part to Ivan my host and Mark H. the slot manager. I have stayed in multiple properties in Las Vegas and I never experienced the great customer service I experienced at the Park MGM. The room was excellent I had an overall GREAT EXPERIENCE!!!
20,Hotel was very basic it was our anniversary and we informed the hotel during booking. Nothing was done no upgrade nothing! Housekeeping our bed and the shower were the only positives of our stay. Beware everything else is an added cost including the water in the room $18 a bottle!
50,Second time staying at this property. I stayed two nights at the NoMad last summer. I was pleasantly surprised that Park MGM rooms were as nice as they were. Very spacious. Huge TV. Bathroom was a little small but excellent shower. Hotel is great - non smoking! Eataly is awesome. Enjoy the casino as well. Location is great and tram to Bellagio is nice as well. Will be back.
50,I really enjoyed my stay at the Park MGM. The facility was immaculate including the onsite restaurants. The entirety staff was extremely courteous kind and helpful.The pool area was amazing. Loved it!
10,Mobile check in app doesn’t work long lines to see a guest services staff member. Girl at check in was nice but I couldn’t use my credit card because their machines weren’t working properly for digital payment. Had to use cash just to be done with it. Check in process took forever…No coffeemaker or fridge no bathmat. Husband found random pills on the floor near the bedside. Elevator area very hot. Neighboring room reeked of weed (smell leached into our room). My husband and I are sober so we didn’t appreciate it one bit. The hotel is supposed to be non-smoking- regardless of the type of smoke. Rooms had zero soundproofing. We could hear their TV through the wall at a normal volume. Neighbors were also loud all night in and out of their room smoking weed. Worst night’s sleep. This was the last night of our honeymoon on an otherwise awesome trip elsewhere. (Sad to end on this disappointing note).
10,Room key was given to stranger new room was offered after I caught the mistake elevator could not stop on floor 28 so had to ride elevator to other guest floor and get on new elevator to get to room just to have ac not work in new room
50,Love the 100% NON-smoking casino! Why don't all of the MGM Casinos go NON-smoking? Make a small totally enclosed room for the smokers and let the rest of us breathe! Come on folks ... less than 13% of casino patrons smoke yet we all have to suffer the disgusting results.
40,If you are a non-smoker this is the hotel for you. No one will light up next to your slot machine or blackjack table. It's a good location next to New York New York. T-Mobile Arena is behind the property. A free tram can take you to Aria and Bellagio. I found it easy to get in and out of. The rooms are a bit small and unusual in that the bed faces the window and not the TV. The TV has an arm that swings out. There wasn't a dresser in my room. The bathroom vanity seemed small there may not be enough room if there are two of you. I found the shower water pressure was weak. The room was quiet. I also wish they gave you something for your resort fee at least a free bottle of water but the water on offer was attached to a sensor. It seems nickle and diming to do that. The Eataly at the front of the casino was amazing. The check in was easy and the elevators are right there so you don't have to drag your bag through the casino. And did I mention no smoking?
40,Usually stay with Total Rewards but wanted to stay somewhere different and glad we did.Park MGM was a fun time and definitely will be back.The property was small but packed with many fun things to do and close to everything.The pools were a fun time and well maintained.
50,I love staying at Park MGM since it's smoke free. It's in the perfect location on the strip and is easy to navigate. It's hard to get lost inside Park MGM and you have great restaurants inside and just outside. We walk to New York New York MGM Grand Aria and Bellagio if we want large crowds additional food options or shopping. Miracle Mile and Top Golf are a short walk away.
10,As a Hyatt globalist got zero attention no upgrades.was told on Hyatt globalist line I couldn’t be guaranteed a 4 pm check out but 2 pm for sure.    We planned our drive to another Hyatt according to these instructions but when calling to request a late check out they said we had to leave by 11 am … no exception because the hotel was supposedly full although the casino was completely empty the nite before. (? Seriously?)    This property has no coffee makers & yet there is no in room dining available until 7 am.    No perks  no amenities… choose another spot.
50,We had a great stay last weekend! The room was very clean and had a unique design. The location was excellent there were lots of great food options in the hotel and it was nice to come back to a smoke free atmosphere. I would highly recommend Park MGM to anyone looking for a nice accommodation at a very reasonable price. It’s a nice middle ground between some of the very inexpensive properties and the luxury properties.
50,If you don’t like smelling like a moldy ash tray .. PARK MGM is for you . Great place with plenty of food options all within a short walk. There’s a CVS / Walgreens / Target close  shake shack  and all fast food options .
20,Hallways were dark and dingy. Need better lightning. Something must have happened on the floor as there were multiple dehumidifiers set up. Bed sheets were stained. Expected more from a resort that charged large fees.
50,hotel is in a great location friendly environment great restaurants and great customer service. i will definitely recommend this hotel to friends and family and i will definitely book this hotel if/when i return to las vegas
10,I don’t recommend anyone  very dirty room .  No fan at the bathrooms . Room doors wasn’t locking . Many more bad things . It’s bad hotel no refrigerator it’s summer  everyone need comfort when they’re paying that much .
40,Negative  1- Tub does not drain  2- no mini Fridge  3- still has room delivered but it is expensive  Positive  1- Great blackout out curtains  2- Great AC  3- Still has food delivered to the room  I took the living room trash can and the laundry bag added ice and used that as the cooler for my drinks
50,Breathe easy and have fun. Room was clean and close to the elevator. Check in was smooth even though I didn't use the app. Location was great as the casino is close to a lot of other businesses. Thank you.
50,This was an amazing experience and would definitely reccomend Park MGM Food was great service was great clubs were amazing although lines were long overall i had a GREAT stay and will be back in the near future.
50,We loved that hotel & casino are smoke free. The restaurants were great. Love a room with an additional bathroom but look forward to next vidit at Park MGM. We were celebrating my 80 birthday.😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊
30,Although we received reimbursement of resort fees we were totally disappointed in house keeping. Our room was only made up 4 out of 7 days with out requesting housekeeping. With Covid we found housekeeping leaving other products in our room that did not belong to us (battery pack charged into our charger) very unprofessional.
50,Loved it!......... One of my favorite trips to LV!.......... Love that it is nonsmoking!!... The staff was so helful and the food was out of this world! The steakhouse and Eataly are must stops. I would definitely recommend this place.
50,The whole experience was great. I arrived well before normal check-in time but had no problem getting into my room. The entire facility is clean and well maintained. The fact that it is smoke free adds greatly to the experience. No watery eyes no stinky clothes to spoil the fun. Lots of good places to eat and walking distance to many restaurants casinos and other venues.
10,No matter what you set the thermostat on the room does not get cold. I saw this on another review and thought maybe it was just someone having a bad day. I set the AC down to 63 but it never got cool. The sheets are kind of rough for my taste. If you have lower expectations and don't need a cold room maybe its OK . I have stayed a lot of Vegas hotels and will add this to the list of the ones I will not go back to including Park MGM Excalibur Mirage Treasure Island Stratosphere and Circus Circus. I thought the Park MGM was higher end than the others on this list but it ended up on the no stay list just the same. The room lobby and everything look nice but I will stay elsewhere. Best feature was the water pressure in the shower was good.
50,We had a bit of a mix-up to start. We thought we were at the MGM grand. I all worked out and the Park was wonderful. Things were within walking distance. The tram was a great way to get around. I would recommend the Park to our friends.
30,Prepare to be harassed at the pool. They have no consideration for anything no matter weather you are buying drinks or just swimming. It is a very hostile environment unprofessional and bad service.
50,We stay there for 5 day everything was great from hotel and casino. The staff was friendly and helpful. The pool was great the Primerose restaurant was very good we use had our breakfast there. I would definitely recommend this hotel.
50,from the arrival they treated us very well everything was excellent for the next one I need a room with a refrigerator coffee maker  un tiempo placentero ya que fui por cumplir 40 años de matrimonio  enjoy its casino restaurants and more
50,I really love the place! Smoke free and close with a lot of attraction. All the staff very friendly. Can’t ask more for everything. We really enjoy our stay. If you really like Italian food  this place is the best!!!
50,Smoke free and clean room. Very convenient location on the strip. Dining selections were great and the pool area was very relaxing. Gaming areas were smoke free clean and comfortable to play in. I highly recommend Park MGM.
50,One of the biggest pluses for me was that the casino is smoke free. My family and I had great friendly service while checking in and house keeping was excellent. We will definitely be staying at park mgm again!!
50,Nice room kept very clean the entire time. Very friendly staff. The shower is awesome! Electronic check in and check out made the whole affair effortless. Never had to stand in line one time. I will say that the Primrose restaurant for breakfast or lunch should be avoided. There are much better places to eat at Eataly which is on the other side of the casino. Overall I would recommend this hotel.
50,Rooms are very nice and clean. The hotel smells amazing and very clean. Front desk and every employee in the hotel and casino very helpful and polite. Close to other casinos and access to the tram that takes you to Bellagio.
50,Nice room. Great check in. Great amenities and restaurants. Wonderful food at all price points. A fantastic location in easy walking distance. A world class performance Venus. NOT as classy as Bellagio but also not near as expensive.
50,Great stay we loved the new theme and remod was a success great food and great time had by all in our party of 5. I won a $2500 jackpot on a high limit wheel of fortune and spent several days there.
50,Loved the location. Free tram to Aria and Bellagio was really nice to have. Reasonable price place to stay. We seen Arosmith there and had a great time. Super close to go to the UFC events. We always stay here.
50,Great hotel centered on the Vegas Strip close to everything and very classy & peaceful for the price! The restaurant are excellent my wife and I ate at almost all of them. We also ate in “Eataly” several times.
50,Kinda feels like home. Wonderful staff.  Centrally located.  I definitely recommend the Park!!  You have the Dolby theater.  Gre shops the pools are nice everything is clean. The staff are wearing mask. The casino floors were hoping. They have a roller coaster next door always a plus.
20,This was formerly the Monte Carlo and we stayed here several years ago. It’s been since redesigned. To say that the design was disappointing is an understatement considering that the Bellagio Aria are a sister hotels.  The hotel was very dirty and not Vegas standard. It all starts with your first impression and when you step into a dirty elevator with dirty mirrors it just goes downhill from there. The hallways are really dark and the our room was very dirty. To walk in and the first thing you see is someone else’s toothpaste residue in the sink is nasty af. I’m not a prude but the hotel rooms are not Vegas quality and cleaning staff were not around. You definitely are paying more pay for what you get. We stayed the last 2 days in Harrahs for a fraction of the cost in better and cleaner rooms. Just saying for an MGM hotel they definitely need to up their game. Biggest highlight was Eataly and location.  So if your fine sleeping in a dirty room then this is the hotel for you.
50,Loved the hotel. First and foremost because it was non-smoking throughout the place. I had a great room. Pool was great not too crowded it had a pool for over 18. Played great music. But wasn't so youth orientated us old folks were driven away. Love the Italian market place.
40,Rooms are just for sleeping. (Our room had no refrigerator microwave coffee machine.  Building and casino are non-smoking (believe only one on the strip).  Does not have many choices to eat in the facility.  Pool hours are not open very late.
40,I chose this hotel for a stay while in town for a family gathering. Full disclosure I am kind of a huge snob and do most of my traveling internationally. I decided on Park MGM because it was smoke free had a nice pool for downtime and offered a good onsite option for a nice solo dinner as I was traveling alone. I was also drawn to the decor which is a little cooler than a lot of fake-fancy Vegas options.    I spent a total of 8-10 hours at the 18+ pools which had a DJ but overall a chill adult vibe and a convenient taco cart on Saturday. Dinner at NoMad came with excellent service in a lovely setting (get the oysters two ways!) I found myself making repeat trips to Eataly over my three day stay for coffee sandwiches sweets dollar oysters and decent wine. Other than my family event I really only left the property to buy some water and snacks at Target across the street. The 10 minute Lyft to the airport was $15. Just really convenient clean full of amenities and I don't have to take my clothes back to the dry cleaner right away because nobody was smoking indoors.
50,My wife and I spent 5 nights at this awesome hotel located on the strip and close to everything! We really enjoyed our stay thanks to the friendly staff and relaxed atmosphere. The food at Eataly is delicious. We will keep coming back.
40,"We stayed at Park MGM earlier this summer and really enjoyed our stay. We stayed there a few times when it was Monte Carlo and this was our first trip since the overall remodeling. It is probably the best value of all of the MGM properties it has a great location on the south strip it is completely non-smoking the rooms appear to have been completely remodeled the pool is fantastic and the layout of the overall property is great.    The location is almost perfect....you can take the tram all the way to Crystals and Bellagio and you can easily walk to both NewYork NewYork and Aria. We did not smell one bit of smoke the whole time we were there which was great. Our room was fantastic close to the elevator but not loud the bed was very comfortable and the water pressure in the shower was very very good. The pool area may be a little smaller than the Monte Carlo's was I think but much quieter (no more DJ playing rap music at 120 decibels) and a lot more shade. The overall layout of Park MGM is really nice because you do not need to drag your luggage through the casino upon check-in and you can get to the pool without traipsing through the casino with your swim gear. Restaurants are spread out well throughout the property as well.    Could've gone 5-stars but even though it is a great value it is not as upscale as a Bellagio Aria or Cosmopolitan. Our only one concern throughout our entire stay was the Eataly food court area located at the east end of the property (where you enter from the strip). It seemed as though every time we went through there in the evening looking for something to eat or snack on they were closed or shut down early (see separate review of ""Eataly""). Whoever is in charge of Eataly (not sure if they are actually owned by MGM or not (?) really needs to remember where they are and reconsider the hours that they are open.....most visitors to the Las Vegas strip are on vacation and they tend to keep later hours than they do at home.    Overall we really enjoyed our stay at Park MGM!"
50,Great hotel that is completely smoke free. Amazing dining and cocktail options that our group really enjoyed. Our room was clean and comfortable and the bed was great. The property’s park theme really helps bring down all the energy from the strip which is really nice at the end of the day.
50,We had an amazing time with family and friends at Park MGM for our wedding weekend. Good food bars gambling and pool! The rooms were clean and modern and we love the decor. Also great that it’s non-smoking!
50,I gave it 5 stars but that's based on the price level. I'm not saying it's comparable to places like the Cosmopolitan and Aria but it's nicer than the other places I've stayed on the strip in a similar price range.
40,Before I went to bed on the first night ~ 10PM I stepped on microshards of glass plus one big shard of glass as soon as I took off my slippers. My foot bled. Security came up to take evidence photos. Offered a compensatory voucher by Gennifer - Security who was really empathetic about it. Housekeeping came up to vacuum and saw all the shards of glass. Katherinne- Housekeeping Runner gave us a compensatory voucher as it was a housekeeping miscue. In their defense the microglass is tough to see in the day but is visible depending on the light and was embedded in the carpet.  We stayed 3 nights not a single day our room was serviced. I was assuming they don't service stayovers or maybe it's dependent on length of stay? On our last day we saw the service cart in our hallway and monitored when they were close to our room when we expected our room to be next we left to play roulette and walk around the Strip for 2+ hours or so. Came back at 5PM room was not cleaned. We called down for service who said they'd be up at 7PM perfect because we had dinner reservations at that time. Came back to the room un-serviced at 9PM.  Of course my fiance was upset so I called down for fresh towels at least for us to shower and was offered another compensatory voucher again. Great? I guess but the voucher never came up but the towels did in 1hr ~10PM. I called back Gage - Guest Services as able to F&B Credit to our room but we really couldn't use it as we had an early flight the next morning and just had dinner that night. About another half hour later (while we were asleep) a knock on the door was another set of towels and the compensatory voucher ~11PM.    We do not seek compensation EVER as I work in the hotel business and hardly complain but stepping on glass bleeding being skipped for service and then scheduled service was missed was an area that needs improvement.    The vouchers went towards Eataly breakfasts and Best Friend thankfully the food options were great. Everything else about the hotel location tram to Aria then Bellagio. Food options in house -Best Friend Eataly Starbucks a few other small snack and breakfast places were all within the hotel. The Tram helped get around as well the strip faster as well.
50,Love this hotel/casino. No smoking so the air quality in the casino is great you don't stink and your eyes don't dryout like the other casinos. MGM rewards system is strong keeps track of how much you play at any MGM casino gives you perks for playing. Pool is nice staff is friendly check-in and out is fast and easy as it can all be done from the app. Great place to stay in Vegas! Also Bavette's steakhouse has amazing bone marrow appetizer I just have it as my meal.    C.A.M.
40,Great please to stay. Pool is okay.  Steakhouse was beyond excellent service and food quality. Over all I'd stay here again. Close to everything staff upgraded us to a high floor with strip veiw for free.
50,Wow! The air quality of the casino/hotel is so refreshing as it is smoke free. All three pools were relaxing and Eataly and the food kiosks were great. Location on the strip is good as Target Walgreens and CVS are right across the street.
50,This is our first stay in Park MGM we definitely coming on our future short trip room is clean and very nice ambience. My family love to stay here again. Because it is a non smoking hotel. Specially they have a health problem.
50,If you're looking for a great location in a beautiful hotel on the strip Park MGM is the place. Everything was clean check-in and check-out very easy. Great places to eat. I love that this hotel isn't massive like some of the other popular places. Best part is the free tram to other hotels so you don't have to walk. Can't wait to go back!
40,The staff at the Park are very friendly and professional. Loved the fact that the hotel and casino are non-smoking. We were travelling with a couple other families and one of them encountered issues with their room…hairs in their bathroom sink when they checked in a clogged shower drain and a safe that wouldn’t lock and had to be fixed three times. But that seemed to be an anomaly. We were happy with our room and the service from the staff. A convenient location on the strip.
40,The location is great and the non-smoking environment mitigates problems for individuals prone to sinusitis. The food options are excellent with La La Noodle and Eatily's delicious pasta dishes. Likewise there are several ways to cool off in the three pools.
50,Our overall stay was wonderful. We’ve stayed with “Monte Carlo” before and there wasn’t any change with Park MGM; I will stay with Park MGM over and over again. All our stay on 3 separate occasions were all very wonderful. I even convinced my sister and brother-in-law to stay in this hotel. Jonathan and Adrian of Front Desk we’re both VERY helpful with our (second) stay; they both are real assets to your front desks
20,Not pleased with service we were provided will not be staying here again    The two gentlemen who checked us in and out were amazing.    The housekeeping and mgm rewards table were also amazing.    Customers should be advised that rooms do not come with refrigerators they are only upon request.    Housekeeping should make sure they pay attention to dirty sheets or stains on the sheets before a new guest comes in.
30,"Perfect if you're by yourself with a ""hall pass"" for a night or two. Room pool area and overall property is ""middle of the road"" but the food/drink pricing is eeeexxxxpensive. Very clean and temperature cool."
50,Everything was great from location to easy parking to the friendliest staff ever..great Gaming great restaurants...eataly a must . The Pools are amazing as well as the staff. Got a much needed massage in the POOL area by massage therapist Ramon Saucedo his hands were MAGIC THE ROOMS ARE SO CLEAN AND COMFORTABLE.YOU CAN'T GO WRONG WITH THE MGM RESORTS AND REWARDS PROGRAM
50,I had yet another great experience at the Park MGM. Mark Hazlett the Casino slot manager really showed excellent customer service and very knowledgeable on each game. He assured I was fine and shared all the insights on the amenities in the Park MGM.    I will be visiting again soon!!
50,Had a wonderful brunch at Eataly a delightful selection of wine and food. Along with a cafe and decadent dessert and pastries to enjoy. There’s plenty to see and indulge in here or to take to go and enjoy later.
50,Nice property conveniently located with Tran connection to Aria Bellagio and shops at Crystal. New York New York Casino MGM Grand and casinos south of Tropicana Ave easily assessable. The Eataly food area and Layla Noodle all a plus!
40,Good pool location and hotel. a/c could’ve been a little cooler but overall a good experience. It was nice to walk down straight to the pool from the hotel. Also nice to walk out from Eataly and be right on the strip.
40,Great stay perfect location! Love the pool area had no issues getting 2 loungers with an umbrella. Spotty pool service but the girls are moving non stop…Rooms are nothing fancy but comfy bed and nice view. We did experience 2 days where our room wasn’t cleaned…we spoke to Sydney in Guest Services who assisted us with getting this fixed up. We would stay again and would recommend.
50,Rooms was fantastic recommend the nighthawk sweet which has an adjoining room if needed. All staff are super friendly. Clean no smoking and feel safe. Bought cabana which was ver nice they don’t negotiate a food and beverage deal after use so make sure you do that when reserving as they told us they would have.
50,Not often does banquet staff take the time to get to know the many many folks that are coming and going during a conference. This week I was surprised to see a friendly smile and genuine desire to ensure my satisfaction and the treat of seeing Blanca Casco every day at each meal. She was attentive and really seemed to be so happy doing her job. What a treat!
30,House keeper standing in hall. Never made up room. There were at least 2 standing on the hall for hours. Ask when they could make up the room. They aimed they were busy abd would get to it. The room was never made up.
50,The staff was outstanding. The facility was well maintained. It was very clean. The no smoking was absolutely amazing. One of the main reasons we stayed here and more casinos should do this as well. No smoking. The regular MGM across the street is smoking we went there one night and left after an hour it was disgusting and smelled of rancid smoke. We will be back for sure.
50,The stay was very nice. The rooms are very clean and location is not bad either. Going downstairs you get to experience a nice area too. The casino is nice and clean the restrooms and cleaned frequently.
50,Beauty and Essex is a must try at the Cosmopolitan! This restaurant was a first time visit and I must say we were not disappointed. Make time to go and a must have is the Grilled Cheese Smoked Bacon & Tomato Soup Dumplings and the Mexican Street Corn Ravioli (we order two of these that’s how amazing they were). We were a party of four and shared everything we ordered and we were completely satisfied! The 38 oz. Tomahawk Ribeye was fabulous and cooked to perfection as well as the salmon. We will definitely be back and try other items. The servers and service was top notch👍🏼Make sure you make reservations! You won’t be disappointed here.
50,Great location close to many attractions on the strip. Helps with not having to walk so far. Hotel has been renovated so everything is new and nice. Rooms are clean and have nice drapes so it stays dark and you can sleep in.
30,Wouldn’t stay there again because of the age of hotel/missing luxuries of home like a mini fridge/hotel reservation & check in experience. Also the location is not super close to a lot of food options unless you go to New York New York with their many little lunch places that happen to be open fairly late.
50,Clean and large rooms. Smoke free environment is great. The Eaterly was fantastic. The pool selection is nice and was not a crazy scene. The housekeeping staff was also very helpful with any request we had.
50,First of all you have to get the app downloaded to your phone. I did it the day before I arrived and i got a notification that my room was ready as I got off the plane around 1030a so that was early! So I checked in on the app and when I got to the hotel I went straight up to the room without having to wait in any line! So easy! Check out was just as easy. If you don't use the app you are a fool - just do it!
30,You get what you pay for . It’s not expensive but it’s good for a quick getaway. Rooms are outdated and AC is not cold. Overall hotel is clean and good for the price. This hotel has a lot of good restaurants.
50,We had an amazing visit and an amazing time! Hotel was clean and staff was excellent. From dinner recommendations to hotel cleanliness everyone did a great job! The food was also amazing and the prices were fair
40,I enjoyed my stay here. Friendly staff when I checked in and I was able to check-in earlier. There was a $200 deposit at check-in. I really liked that it’s smoke-free location. It’s nice that it has trams that go to Aria & Bellagio. I went to the Veranda pool and it’s good for me since it’s shallow only 3-4ft. The food service is not available when I got there around 6pm and I’m glad the server at least offer me chips with some dips. There’s a qr code on the pool chairs so you can order. My room had a connecting room and I could hear the other room’s music. I could also hear some of the plumbing. But it’s okay because I’ll be outside most of the time anyways. I really like the hotel’s location and it’s close to Ross CVS M&Ms Hershey’s & Hello Kitty Cafe which are all across the street.
50,The checkin process and checkout process was extremely smooth. We got digital keys through the app. The rooms were comfortable. Many good restaurants were walkable. There was also a free tram to Bellagio! We like the Eataly restaurant for their coffee and pastries!
50,The hotel was clean and fresh the staff was above and beyond and the location is ideal for the strip or quieter desires too. The food court is fresh and healthy with a nice variety for those who choose to stay in.
20,we stayed in room #121 at F 22 Checked in on Friday and Checked out on Sunday. The room was very dusty (TV table the round table and the bathroom rack) and one of our queen bed sheet has stain on it looks like shoe prints. We called the housekeeping and they brought us a bag of blanket (waited about 20 mins) that we need to change ourselves? Just wondering why we need to pay for the resort fee and change the bed sheet by ourselves? ALSO they didn't fill up the tissues and toile paper so we called the housekeeping again (waited an other 20 mins). Hope you can pay close attention to the small details. The only the we can't complain about are the comfortness of the bed
50,New moderate hotel in good location. Rooms are roomy and clean.  Staff were nice  The only thing that wasn't convenient is not having a coffe machine at the room. It was achallenge to get a cup of coffee
50,You won’t be disappointed!  Location is perfect!  Smoke free is wonderful!  Easy check in and check out comfortable rooms friendly staff excellent location a breeze to get to and from the airport and good gaming.
20,Was very frustrating trying to use the incentives that were offered. We flew out there because of what was being offered and there was an issue with everything spent too much time at the hotel lobby desk trying to resolve it. Which was disappointing because our trip was only 3 nights and had to visit the front desk 5 different times
20,Misinformation...lack of follow through no one cleaned our room after requesting...no fun being in Vegas returning to a filthy room dirty towels bed linen and garbage filled bins. Excuses about short staffing.
50,If you enjoy clean hotels that are non-smoking and have good food this is the place for you. Everyone is so nice everything is so clean and check in is so quick and easy. Bottomless mimosas at Primrose.
50,I decided to try the Park MGM on my last visit to Las Vegas and I was not disappointed. The hotel is modern clean smoke free and in a good location. The staff was friendly. Good choice of restaurants in the Eatery. Our room was lovely. Clean comfortable and modern. I especially love the outlets and USB ports. (6 or 8 I lost count!). The bathroom is modern with a large shower and nice to have drawers in the closet area. We were not able to use the pools due to timing but we walked through and they looked amazing! I will be booking a room at the Park MGM during my next visit! Loved it!
30,My room was not ready till late evening was told i had to wait i waited two hours with ny kids and i was being charged for things that was not grabbed sensor on table was not working properly not sure if i would stay again
40,The casino is nice non-smoking. The room just okay. I loved the shower and view from the window. The bed was AWFUL! It felt like it was 50 years old from back in the cowboy days! Lumpy hard sunken.... ugh. Could not sleep or get comfortable.
20,We stayed here for 4 nights and not one night could we find service on the casino floor. We would search and wait but then got fed up and went to another hotel to play. We also paid for 2 cabanas during our stay. The cost of the cabanas are not credited back in a good/booze credit like before. The cabanas were not cleaned had dirty old food in the fridge no service (had to use the button several times) and way over priced for what you got. I will say the rooms were decent and Eataly was great as always. But that was it.
50,First timers at Vegas and at this location. Everyone was very kind and helpful. This will be our go to place moving forward. Contacting the hotel via email was also great had nothing to worry about. 5/5 would recommend
40,Had a fun time during our stay. The night hawk suite was just great. price was reasonable. surprising there wasn't a refrigerator in the room but otherwise all good. would definitely stay again. close to the strip and all the activities. pool area had 3 options. reserved lounge chairs which worked out nicely.
10,The room AC was not working and we couldn’t get the temperature to come down to our comfort level. The bedsheets were rough and cheap the mattress was cheap the housekeeping service was terrible and we didn’t have enough towels products or a shower mat for our room the first night and again they didn’t properly restock the next day. We booked a StayWell room thinking it would be better quality but it wasn’t.  Besides the room the staff at the hotel was nice.
20,Had made reservation for a regular king size bed but was giving an accessible room with the king bed. I am not sure how old the mattress are but it was in very poor condition while lying on the bed I sunk in and could feel the bottom of the mattress.  After calling the help desk they changed the room to a two queen size bed room due to availability which one of the bed was as same condition as the king size bed on the 1st room and the other bed was just a bit better.  The WIFI was very spotty shower was dripping all night and on the last day there the room was not cleaned after calling the front desk  they said they most likely forgot/skipped our room so they sent some fresh towel's etc.  Overall it was a very bad experience and I believe it was not worth what we paid even though they waived the resort fees
30,The rooms are very basic - no frills. We stayed here because we got a comped room offer and haven't been here since it was The Monte Carlo. We weren't impressed and most likely wouldn't stay here again.
50,Vegas has always had the drawback of smoke smells everywhere. Park is different. Everything is great and I don’t wake up feeling like I slept with the Marlboro man. Otherwise everything went great. Used a rewards program for the room and we had a view of the arena.
40,Most impressed at the easy access from our room to the parking structure and not having to walk through the casino. Enjoyed that the hotel was nonsmoking as well. Great time at the swimming pools and enjoyed the bar. One area needing improvement is the bed. It was too soft and low to the ground especially for two.  Not impressed by the service at Eataly- we were told by the bartender that he was too busy to help us and to go find another bar.
50,Smoke free casino…amazing!! My lungs really appreciated this. Staff was very friendly Eataly is amazing room was quiet. The hotel also has a free tram that goes to the Bellagio. Great stay! The only downside is the pool closes pretty early.
50,great service. excellent choice of food. convenient location. friendly and knowledgeable staff. Love the pools. Already planning our next trip and trying to get other family members to make it. clean rooms would like to see a few more headliners at the hotel.Hd a ball playing craps and three card poker with my son
50,Great hotel clean and smoke free. Nice staff. Great pool at NoMAd. Wait staff at poolside very attentive. Front desk very helpful and wanted to do everything they could to get us what we needed. Bell desk allowed us to use wheelchair until ours arrived.
50,I like the smoke free and how clean the rooms was quick check in and out was very good I will be back to stay the pool was very nice I believe I saw 3 pools our stay was great we love everything about this hotel..
50,We have great experience.. only room service made beds under request but housekeeper sara did great job.great restaurants and location..  Antonio from front desk was really helpful and kind.  Easy access to
50,Park MGM is very clean and a nice casino. The staff are very friendly and helpful. The food is also delicious wherever you dine at. I love the fact that the casino is smoke free and that the air is clean. Would definitely recommend to everyone!
40,housekeeping was a little slow to respond but all other staff was very good we like the no smoking policy clear air friendly to animals security keeps place safe casino area clean and nicely decorated
40,It was so refreshing to have a smoke-free casino and hotel on the strip! You notice the difference! Rooms are comfortable without being too cheap or over-the-top but did not come standard with a refrigerator or coffee maker. Even with that though for the price location and clean air I would definitely would stay here again!
50,We visit Vegas frequently and we love staying and visiting Park MGM. On the night of July 5 my mother and I were walking around Eatly (restaurant / wine area) and we met Hank G. a security officer. Hank was very professional knowledgeable and welcoming. He told me about the wine tasting that would be held the next day (he told us the times and prices). He answered all my questions! Hank is the main reason I will return to this property! Please acknowledge his exceptional customer service skills.
50,Love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love MGM park safe friendly good food good people good winning meet people i go 3 times a year next trip October hello Vegas
40,This is one of my favorite places to stay while in Vegas! I love using the MGM Resorts mobile app for check-in/check-out process. On our last trip we arrived in Vegas late but already had our room assignment and were able to bi-pass registration and go straight to our room using our digital key (cell phone). The next morning we went to a kiosk in the main lobby and printed some room keys also just using the app. Check-in/check-out all done through your phone. No more lines!    Room decor is not my favorite but our rooms have always been nice and clean (my favorite is the Nighthawk suite). Housekeeping is good. The location on the strip is perfect for us - pretty centralized if you prefer to walk rather than taxi or Uber! Park MGM has one of my favorite casinos . . . . the Eataly is interesting and has good very food although it can be crowded and sometimes seating there can be at a premium. You won’t find all the fancy shops magnificent statues etc. but I don’t think you would be disappointed! I would definitely go back.
50,Dustin was very helpful and knowledgeable. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Room was spacious and comfortable. We celebrated our anniversary together and we were happy with accommodations. Thank you.
50,Great place comfortable beds and rooms friendly staff and smoke free. Restaurants need early reservations as they are often full but food is delicious at most of them. Gambling room is clean and cocktail waitresses do come around more often then other casinos.
50,Had a wonderful time! Great host wonderful food. Gaming was fun. Dealers and everyone were very friendly and professional.  I loved the Monte Carlo and I love the Park MGM.  Ambience is really nice. Nice laidback vibe which is so awesome when you want to relax and have some low key good times.
50,I was forced to find a hotel at the last minute because of a flight cancelation. I chose the Park MGM because it was right on the strip adjacent to shopping had a nicely laid out casino and had Eataly (a food court of various upscale Italian style food booths) right in it. The room was clean and bright with a nice bathroom and plenty of room. I actually had a LOT of fun despite my airline predicament. The price of the room was half that of neighboring hotels which was amazing for the quality (I had just spent 3 nights at the Aria which was not any different other than being taller)
50,The check in was smooth and easy no line when we checked in they also have it where you can check in from your phone but we choose to check in with a person he was great and helpful. When we got up to our room it was clean and had a nice view of the pool we unpacked and got ready for the pool. The pool was nice and relaxing no loud music. After the pool we went out to dinner and came back and went to sleep it was a very comfortable bed my husband feel asleep in seconds and me to to far behind him. When we checked out it was also easy they have a little check out area you just enter your information and bam! Your done slip the room keys in the slots and go. Over all it was a nice stay and I would definitely come again. Also as a plus it's a no smoking casino so it smells nice inside and we wanted snacks at the pool and they were able to just charge our room since we forgot our wallet and purse.
50,A refuge! No mile-long walks to get to your room. No smoking anywhere! The rooms are very nice pretty new. No it's not a big fancy resort but so comfortable and convenient and close enough to all the other big fancy resorts. Also Eataly right there fantastic for any meal + yummy snacks.
50,Friendly helpful staff and great smoke free environment. The room was clean and so was the hotel. The food was excellent many great choices and the service was welcoming and helpful. A great experience with the family overall.
50,Love the non smoking casino clean and friendly staffs. Check in was easy and fast service.  Delicious food at Eataly pool area are clean and cocktail service was pleasant and no long wait.  Highly recommend this Hotel/Casino.
50,Absolutely beautiful. My family loved it here so much. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Our room was very clean and the beds felt great after a long day. We will definitely be staying here again
50,We really enjoyed the resort. Everything was easily accessible and great options for food on campus! We enjoyed eating at Eataly. We loved Best Friend. The rooms were nice and modern! We will be back!
50,Went through Amex fine hotels and resorts thought the experience was really nice especially Eatly. Rooms were pretty good quality but very good value. $520 total for 2 nights for a hotel on the strip felt like a really good deal (esp with the Amex platinum reimbursement)
20,I am so disappointed in the beds here at Pork MGM.you have one main job - to have nice and comfortable beds for your guests to sleep on. Epic fail. Poor room cleaning and mostly non existent. Been waiting for housekeeping all day to change the linens and been trying for 10 hours to get some help with room cleaning- called front desk and housekeeping several times today. Stay somewhere else you’ll be disappointed too.
10,I am very disappointed with the room I don’t think I will ever stay at another MGM property again. The problem was not corrected and the room attendant argued with me.  The price was good but so what. I will be going back to Caesars properties where I’ve never experienced such an issue
40,Nice Place but the beds were pretty hard and no Mini fridge or coffee maker in the room wasn't cool either. Smoke free was nice! Staff was VERY friendly and helpful. We didn't eat at the restaurants inside so can't give a review on those.
50,Has it all: location amenities great staff. Busiest on the strip and has tram between properties. Good selection of restaurants expensive like every restaurant in Las Vegas but all top notch. Will visit again.
50,Me and my wife have been staying here when it was the Monte Carlo I have enjoyed staying here because it's right in the middle of everything. Because when you go out of the Hotel you can either go left or right and there is something to do or see.
30,Very nice and clean hotel. Loved non-smoking. Rooms were very clean and nicely made. Only ran into a problem when I was overcharged and the manager Leo was rude and unhelpful. He could not answer any question I had for him and said too bad to me for the position I was in. Manager Walter however was the complete opposite the next morning. He was very helpful and took care of everything I was worried about. Great person!!!! If it was not for Walter I would never recommend Park MGM but I will now
40,The Positives:    Great position. Smoke free environment. Eataly. Deuce Bus Stop and footbridge right outside. Shower with some power (seems rare in the States). Plenty of elevators. Good safe in the room. Pools are great. Nice check in staff    The Negatives.    Hotel lacks Vegas Pzazz - it’s very functional. Rooms are basic and Queen Size beds didn’t seem to be very big. No bath. Lack of fridge and coffeemaker is petty especially as Starbucks shuts early so you can’t even buy a coffee. Not much storage space in the rooms. Hallway carpets could really use a vacuum. Pools shut too early (7pm) and at least one of them could do with a deep end
50,Park MGM is smoke free and located perfectly on the strip. The tram in the hotel runs to Aria and Bellagio. It is close to so many wonderful spots. I highly recommend this place to stay. We enjoyed every minute of our stay and will definitely be back.
50,You will be enjoy the spacious rooms. Beds are comfortable. Rooms have a couch to sit on to relax and enjoy the view. You are within walking distance of so many food places entertainment and more casinos.
30,Reasonable prices for rooms and food. Nice restaurant selection. Smallish casino floor. Rooms could be cleaner. Looks like they haven’t dusted or vacuumed ever. Decent pool area with nice food and drink selection.
40,We enjoyed our stay here. The staff was very helpful and friendly. The rooms were clean and relaxing. I am glad this hotel/casino has gone smoke free. I also liked that they have great benefits/rewards for military personnel.
40,The property is nice and the prices are reasonable for the rooms. The restaurant options are minimum. The housekeeping slacked off on the 2-3 day. I will stay here again because it is smoke free which is definitely a PLUS!!!
30,Horrible pay outs on slots and no consideration for diabetics when requesting mini fridge for insulin. Told front desk and was told it would be sent up and never got it or told why it wouldn't be there
50,This hotel is cute small (easy to get around) great places to eat and above all smoke free which is a big selling point for me. Very refreshing to come back too after visiting other casinos. Would definitely stay again.
50,Great! The room was perfect for us. We wish there was a refrigerator in the room. Would’ve been a lot better with one. The restroom was a bit smaller than expected but worked for us. View of the T-Mobile arena
10,I had an issue with my hotel room that we did not notice until the second day. The room had minor cleanliness issues the lamp did not work and the tv started having issues. I voiced my concerns to the front desk and they were extremely quick to get off the phone with me. Although they set up someone to come up and fix our issues they never told us a ETA so we left because we had plans. When I called again to voice my concerns about the front desk lady getting off the phone so fast I was told that the lady usually doesn’t do that. Well that was no help to me considering she did it to me. Nothing got resolved with it being one of the more expensive MGM resorts I expected a lot more.
50,The Park MGM is one of my favorite hotels! Their decor the hotels food options the bathrooms and not to mention the best part the beds Wowzers. Best sleep ever! So happy to have booked there wish it could have been longer!!
30,I've been coming here for years since it was the Monte Carlo. The location is good and I LOVE that it is a smoke-free property. All the staff are professional and friendly. But it lacks a variety of affordable food choices. A whole food court dedicated to Italian food is a bit much.  If you enjoy screaming children in the corridors and dogs dogs dogs everywhere this is your place. Why bring a dog to Vegas?!
40,Perfect location and a polite staff. That’s all I needed. And if you want a good location out of the way but within walking distance to everything The Park MGM is an excellent choice. I’m sure I’ll visit again soon.
40,Other than some lazy cleaning I’m the room  everything else seemed amazing. It was dusty missing the fitted sheet of the bed face prints on windows and questionable stains on the couch. Great area of the strip and a lot of stuff to do around the area.
50,I flew out to Vegas for a few days to escape life for a bit. Park MGM was the perfect fit. An all non-smoking property friendly staff awaited me. There was plenty of various slot machines to play in all different denominations. All my favorite table games were available and the dealers were quite friendly. Bar service was timely. Rooms were clean sanitary. Food choices were adequate for my tastes as I did not have to go elsewhere to eat. The Asian noodle bar was my favorite. Would gladly stay again
50,This Hotel is beautiful with efficient parking check in service. The pricing cleanliness and location are wonderful. The thing that put it over the top for me was the Pool Side service by Melissa. This employee made sure our trip experience was perfect.
40,I enjoyed the Vegas trip casino food and pool area. The Italian food court was exceptional good. The location is very good and near the strip. I enjoyed the positive atmosphere at the casino and surrounding area. Although I was a bit disappointed in the quality of the room . See above . But overall The Park MGM has its good qualities and close association to surrounding casinos . i would give another try and stay at The Park MGM. I would attempt to stay in a more modern room and possibly upgraded room.
50,Great place to stay on the strip with lots of great food a nice pool lots of slots with a decent payout fun and entertainment and I felt safe I saw security by the elevator and In the hallway in the hotel every time I went to my room
10,We booked Park MGM King room. The room had a damp and smelly carpet the furniture is old and shabby and nothing like the marketed pictures. The corridors are dark and dingy with shabby carpets. The room design makes absolutely no sense - the room was a bright red color (completely different than the pictures). There is no mini fridge and coffee machine. Not at all a 4 star quality - they have just renovated the ancient bathrooms but everything else is old and shabby on the 13th floor particularly. The only good thing is the location of hotel is great so it is easy to get out of the horrible room.
50,The parking lot is a very short walk to the hotel. I checked in online the night before so when i got there I just had to print out my keys. Everything was so clean and modern. I like the amount of security as well. The restaurant in the lobby Primrose is beautiful and delicious.
40,Great central location and bonuses for a non- smoking facility due to my husband asthma. Room are decent size with modern decors. Staffs are very friendly and helpful. Will definitely stay here again if we come back to Las Vegas.
50,We were extremely pleased with the location the staff and dealers. The non smoking gaming floor is a huge bonus. If you get a chance try the stands at Eataly and hit the pool. We'll be back for our next visit.
50,Great hotel. Fun restaurants. Ideal for families. Hallways are a little dark. Best of all is the smoke free casino. Such a friendly staff and perfect location! The tram to the Bellagio is wonderful!!!
50,I picked this hotel for its proximity to a show we were attending at the New York hotel next door the fact it's non smoking and for the vacation package deal we purchased through our airline which was a screaming deal. Very happy with our decision and I would stay there again.    PROS:  ~Clean modern spacious non-smoking property.  ~Ride share drop off/pick-up outside lobby (It was approx $15 to the airport depending on time of day).  ~Walking distance to many 'South strip' shows restaurants shops/malls other large hotels half-price ticket booth across the road.  ~3 pools with umbrellas and loungers and pool bar. They swipe your key as you enter. Pool towels available.  ~Self check-in or traditional check-in available. We were happily upgraded to a higher floor. I downloaded the app beforehand but didn't use it.  ~Starbucks on site.  ~Adjacent/on-site casino restaurants and 'Eataly' (Italy) food hall featuring pasta sandwiches breakfast items gelato drinks etc.  ~ Free tram out the back of Park MGM which takes you to Aria or Bellagio hotels. (You will have to walk from the back of those hotels quite a way through the hotels to get to the strip).  ~Haus of Gaga on-site featuring many of Lady Gaga's costumes and head-pieces.  ~Dolby Live theater on-site.  ~Walking distance to T-Mobile Arena.  ~Room features: Hairdryer complimentary toiletries room service A/C long mirror plugs on nightstand snacks and water for purchase.  ~Generally quiet hotel.  ~Gift/convenience shop in the lobby.  ~Great views of the south strip from our room looking towards MGM Grand.  ~Across from Hello Kitty Cafe Denny's Ross Burlington Coke and M&M world half-price tickets.    If you found this review useful please click the thank button.    CONS:  ~Slightly aggressive bellman/bag-check people with heavy hints to tip.  ~Resort fees charged ($39/ni) but unfortunately most Vegas hotels charge these. I made sure I used the hotel pool to feel like I at least got some of my money's worth.    If you found this review useful please click the thank button.
30,Don’t do mobile check in or you will get the worst rooms possible. Check in the front desk so you can review rooms available. Also bath towels had yellow stains. The restaurants are good. The machines don’t pay here.
50,The room was pretty nice. Wish it would’ve had a refrigerator though. And the bed was amazingly comfortable. The best part of the hotel is Eataly!! Could’ve spent the entire trip exploring all of Eataly’s food & dining options.
50,Great convenient location close (walking distance) to many shows activities restaurants and shopping. Nice pool area. Clean and affordable rooms. Will definitely stay here again the next time we're in Las Vegas.
30,The hotel is non-smoking which was a huge bonus for us.    We arrived early on Sunday July 3rd and our room was not ready. Absolutely fine. As I said we did arrive early (7:30am). We left our bags with bell services went to our brunch reservation at Aria and just generally hung out. We returned to the desk at 11:30am asking if there was a possibility we would be able to get a room. The front desk said that housekeeping was currently marked as in our room and they needed 2 hours to clean…so come back in then. We return around 3 hours later at 3:00pm asking to please check in since at this point we had been at the Park for 8 hours. The room was not ready. I understand there might not be a ton that the front desk can do but lying to the guests about the status is a bad start. We were eventually changed to a different suite marked for “another guest”. Thanks.    The rooms look like a cheap house flip. A lot of paint chipping next to no storage and weird room layouts. The room was very clean and even though we were right by the elevators all was quiet. Our smoke detector low battery did start going off at 1:30am which was not appreciated but they did cone to replace the battery once we sat on hold for 10 minutes with the front desk.    We pre-booked a cabana at the 18+ pool Monday July 4th which was great. We also pre-booked a day bed at the 18+ pool for Tuesday July 5th. When we went to check in they tried to put us at a different pool saying the daybeds were all booked. Yes and one was booked by us. Eventually she did assign us to the correct daybed. I brought my confirmation with the QR code so I am not sure what the issue was. Be warned there is a decent sized chip/crack in the bottom of the East pool and another guest did cut her foot. I’m not sure if they fixed that.    Water was shut off for maintenance 1am-6am. We did not turn on the tv but apparently that is where the communication went out.    It was a decently satisfactory hotel but we will choose a different resort next time we stay.
50,went for the 4th. liked that the hotel was near the center of the strip. had very good service from the staff. had great help checking in. I checked out from the room which was a breeze. ate at primrose which was fantastic! had salmon and it was perfectly seasoned. the one complaint there was the super tiny glasses! give me bigger glasses to you don't have to come back every 2 minutes.  room seemed a bit small but didn't stay in room often. Bed and pillows were extremely soft. felt like sleeping on a cloud and after walking what seemed like 1 million miles I got good rest.  shower was nice and big. could use a fridge inside to keep water cold. drinking water in Vegas is very important.
50,PARK MGM is a prime choice casino. Extremely clean. 100% smoke free. Beautiful inside and out. The entire staff goes above and beyond to provide superior hospitality. You will leave fully satisfied!!!
50,Found this hotel on Costco Travel website but ended up booking directly from ParkMGM website to get all the amenities features I wanted to have for my family on July 4th weekend. Walking throughout property and not having to breathe cigarette smoke is a huge reason to stay here. Pools were great smaller than other hotels I've stayed at on the strip but still great facilities. Close to highway and positioned on the strip to make walking around not too onerous. Will definitely book here in future. Convenient contactless registration. Digital room key and parking pass were perfect.
20,"I would comeback only if they fixed their organizational skills and were more considerate when dealing with confused guests.    We were double booked in a room so that another group were wrongly sent to our room twice a confusing phone call from an oblivious front desk/management security to greet us when we left our room (as if we escalated the issue and were there to kick us out or something) and then finally when we thought it was all over since ""they figured it all out and you're good."" We were locked out of our rooms after a long first day on our first trip to Las Vegas.    They felt that this experience only warranted two days of resort fees (ONLY - $88 total) comp'd which was pretty disappointing."
50,Park makes it easy to check in and check out right from your phone. The rooms were clean staff in all areas of the casino were friendly and helpful. It was an enjoyable stay and I will be back. The gaming floor is smoke free which makes for an enjoyable day playing.
20,When I checked in the first time I was sent to a room with someone else’s luggage.    I was offered $50 food and beverage credit and no parking and booked to a new room which had a mysterious wet spot by the closet the safe was locked there was no shampoo or conditioner and a woman’s clothes were left out.    The second day I was staying in a different room and told I could wait in my room and I’d be called when my room was ready.    I never received a call. When I finally went back to the front desk and got the new room initially I was told it would be on the same floor it wasn’t. When I finally got there there were no hand towels. I called housekeeping and waited on hold five minutes and no one ever answered.
50,It was our first time to stay here and we loved it! What's not to like? Smoke free casino and the location is very good.  Love Eataly! The food the staff are all A+ here.  The rooms are clean (we booked 2 rooms) and the price is reasonable.  We will definitely come back!
10,We stayed during 7/1-7/5/22. We did housekeeping one day on 7/3 and they threw away a gift bag sitting on our counter table containing $200 worth of items (my daughter’s custom made epoxy cup with her name on it all items we purchased from the M&M store on 7/1 and that we took all day to obtain - customized m&ms with our family’s faces on them- took us hours to make wait for to create and then walk over to pickup an M&M gumball machine gift a bag of m&ms paid for the pound chocolate foods purchased from Eataly on 7/1). I reported it lost and they said they could cover our resort fees $139 which does not cover the cost and time of the goods lost. They are valued at over $200. When I told them this was a waste of our time and items that were custom made (the customer expoxy cup was custome ordered and designed and made by someone in Florida and was a special gift for my daughter) and all of the custom items took time and money to get. I told them this was not sufficient and they said I could file a report and a security agent came to my office I filled out a sheet and had to call back before we checked out. They did not reach out to me and I was only told that a high manager would need to review. I am now back home hundreds of miles away and no compensation was allied to our $1k trip that we spent there no items were ever recovered. I had to ask for a reference number which was not provided to me had I not demanded they give me something to reference. While I was giving the report to the security officer housekeeping came to our room two times! We did not request anything from them and they had no reason to keep coming back since we already turned them away in the morning while we sleeping in before we noticed our gift bag was thrown away. The 2nd visit they came just to dust the snack tray and leave (how strange!) next they knocked and asked if we needed anything of course we did not especially since they had already came to our room in the morning and we turned them away and the security officer was there. We absolutely put the do Not disturb on the last night because I was afraid they would try to retaliate against us for reporting the loss. They have keys to the rooms too.
50,Self explanatory lol. Great hotel/casino. You can ride the tram for free instead of walking. The tram in through the hotel so you don’t have to step out into the streets unless you want. Perfect way to beat the crowd and stay out of the elements
30,Weird noises in the room… everything else was okay it was close to everything. The room was clean they skipped our room when cleaning which was fixed after I requested clean towels ….. Uber and Lyft was not as expensive as we thought it would have been.
40,It is normally a very good value. Unfortunately I had stayed during the July 4th holiday weekend. There was a big UFC fight at the arena across from the hotel which resulted in street closures making the Uber ride impossible to get to the hotel. Our 10min drive turned into a 70min nightmare. Ended up getting dropped off at Aria and just walking to Park.    Hotel rooms have VERY thin walls. Had a noisy family that kept us up 2 nights in a row. Requested a room change and it was better but still heard our neighbors very easily
30,The cons far outweigh the pros.  Pro: Location; non-smoking casino and rooms  Cons: Too high $$ for what you get...VERY standard room for such a high price (no refrigerator in the room no microwave one washcloth for 2 people could hear the people in the next room loud and clear etc...); bed height made for very short people!; not enough elevators working...people waiting 10 minutes or more for an elevator; shops close early if they were open at all; pool area was only open until 7:00 pm!
40,The only non smoking hotel which was a big plus!! Overall the hotel was good. Clean modern and had almost everything you needed with a hotel. The only downfall that I found was there was only one breakfast place. The lone place had a limited breakfast menu so we had to go to different casinos every morning. Overall I give it a 9
50,MGM is trying something new for the Las Vegas area which is having a completely non-smoking facility including the hotel restaurants and casino. If you're like me and you dislike having to dodge smoke wherever you eat and gamble then this is *the* place to stay.    Not only is the facility so clean and new but the restaurants were fantastic. I enjoyed several delicious dishes at Lala Noodle. I enjoyed the casino and restaurants so much that I came back to play and gamble even after I had checked out from my stay before my departing flight.
40,Nice remodeled hotel that’s smoke free- a real treat in Vegas! Location is excellent and I like that it’s relatively small so it doesn’t take 30 min to get from the lobby up to your room! Pool was ok- not many umbrellas tho
50,Love the casino is smoke free and within minutes you can be in the middle of the strip via tram (free) and also all the amazing restaurants that are down stairs not to mention the short walk to shake shack lol
50,The property is beautiful great location and an awesome selection of restaurants and bars. I would absolutely stay again and reccommend friends to do the same. The menus and food at the Pool Primrose Eataly and LalaNoodle we’re all amazing.
30,Disappointed with the spa when we were refused ropes when there was ropes hanging inside the empty lockers and beds were not made inside the room. We kepted calling downstairs for rooms to be cleaned.
50,I had a pleasant time at the Park MGM. The staff was helpful. There was no stench of cigarette. I even won some money. All-in-all it was a wonderful experience. I highly recommend staying here if you plan on coming.
50,Best experience in Eataly restaurant with security officer Hank Graae very attentive and helpful even went out of his way to recommend en excellent wine!!! Will definitely come back to the same place and if we are lucky we may even run into him again.
50,Stayed at tue Park MGM in June for three nights June 2022. I have not stayed at this property since it was The Monte Carlo. The property looks great. Good location easy to get to other resorts (next to NY NY tram to Aria city center Bellagio) Park MGM has no shortage of good amenities and food outlets. Food is great at Eataly and through the property. I did not use the pool this visit but the pools are basic and simple. No fancy waive pools or lazy rivers. It never looked overly crowded. My room on the 27th floor with a view of the city center was amazing - I would stay here again just for the room view at night it was so beautiful! The staff at the hotel are friendly and helpful. Room amenities were good and the bed was very comfortable MGM resorts should re evaluate the soap and shampoo they use at this resort they all included almond or nut. There are so many people with allergies they need to just use something basic. The best part of this hotel is the no smoking policy so nice not to be infested with tobacco while staying here! Smoking or vaping is not allowed in the rooms pool restaurants casino bars and common areas. Well done MGM resorts on this decision! Las Vegas seems to be rebounding well from Covid 19. Most outlets seemed to be re opened from last year I visited all over Las Vegas. Service overall this visit to Las Vegas seemed to be pretty back on track!
20,No fridge in room when we arrived our sheets were stained crumbs all over the carpet safe was broken glass on shower was dirty. You can hear conversation coming from the room next to you we felt we had no privacy. We booked the hotel for 6 nights. Not impressed at all. Rooms are small. My boyfriend and I were not impressed.
40,Solid spot anytime I go to Vegas especially because of the location. Only thing I wish is that they had fridges in the room and a bigger showerhead but those are minor things. Overall great spot anytime I make this trip
20,Was approached by a man who clearly was not a guest and begged for money while I was in the middle of gambling. I said no to the man and felt guilty and also frustrated as I was no longer able to focus on the game. I also felt embarrassed in the elevator when I checked in because the room key on the app would not work. The lady at the front desk tried to fix the app but could not so she then gave me plastic room keys.last but not least I gambled for over an hour and was not approached once by a cocktail waiter or waitress. All in all service was lacking and so was floor security.
50,Nice hotel great people as always. The rooms are very nice I was in a stay well room that had better beds/showers. This hotel is very nice I have walked inside before as it’s an MGM property however I have not stayed here looking forward to the next visit!!
50,I love the non smoking atmosphere Bavette's Steakhouse Eataly and also love the pools. The room rate is very reasonable and the employees are always very friendly. The rooms are somewhat basic but very nice with comfortable beds and excellent showers. For overall value on the Strip I think that the Park is hard to beat.
50,Park MGM!!  Everybody working there has been so nice helpful and fun!! We were just standing deciding where to eat and Brewster with security came over and asked if we needed any help or if there was any part of our stay that was less than perfect!  Wow how great is that??  Thank you Brewster!!  Chuck and Ladonna at the pool treated us so nice!!  Park MGM...Do it😁
50,Everything about the stay was great. The only complaint I have is that the walls are then so at times I could hear my neighbors conversation. However we were not in the room for long periods of time as we were having a great time.
50,Excellent experience we cannot wait to come back! My husband and I had a wonderful time we enjoyed every moment of it! Eataly was amazing! Good food good drinks good everything! We arrived way ahead scheduled and the hotel was able to accommodate us with an early check in no hassle! I would definitely stay there again and recommend to family and friends!
10,Resort is in an awkward area of the strip and not easily accessible. No fridge in rooms. Bed and pillows are very hard and not comfortable. Staff and security were both rude and unhelpful during a medical problem my family experienced while on the Casino floor. Security initially started to reprimand my father as he was lying on the floor and then never called for help as I was telling her to but instead stood there and watched like my father was having a medical issue for her entertainment. Head of security was useless as well. Nothing was said nothing was offered.
50,The Park MGM was a great hotel located across the street from Deni's and Ross (and now Target).    The casino is non smoking now and the walks to the room are not too far.    There is a smoking section if you need it. This was our first trip back after the pandemic and the pools were open and good fun.    On the downside it was 40+ (c) weather and they could have had more umbrellas by the pool. There was free water and the staff were all friendly.    They clearly need more staff (as does everywhere now!) as getting a drink at the slots took forever.    The free tram to other hotels is a nice addition that should be extended.    Overall we would stay there again. There is a nice cafe for breakfast that I recommend. Excellent service and quality food.    Sadly the 800 degree pizza place is gone!
50,You can't beat military discounts including free parking and a smoke free atmosphere. Try Eatily for great Italian food and drink from sit down dining to multiple food venues and Primrose for a great breakfast.
50,Excellent hotel services and all..we loved it... will return stayed here several times and enjoyed very good value for the price we recommend. Pools are great casino is good played some and made some...
10,My room was supposed to be comped based on the email I received. But it wasn’t . What a rip off. When I asked about it I was told to go to someone else. But they were too busy to help me. Never again. I feel misled
50,Good experience staff was great and helpful. The room was clean and spacious. Had a enjoyable stay. The Hotel also had a variety of eateries food was excellent. Would recommend the resort to anyone if they want to have an enjoyable stay.
50,This hotel is well situated with great access everywhere. Very clean smoke free and friendly staff. They have some great restaurants in there as well. They have a complementary tram that can take you on that side of the strip for several hotels and shopping. I highly recommend
50,Super friendly staff and awesome restaurants non smoking casino was a great experience the swimming pool is great. Highly recommend anything at Eataly or Best Friends restaurants. Also centrally located next to T-Mobile arena
50,Everytime i walk into a casino all i smell is smoke and i can't breathe at all but at Park MGM i can actually breathe WOW. Finally a non smoking casino and smoke free premises. I really enjoy staying and dining at the italian eatery.
20,"I had a complimentary night at Park MGM for my birthday and $150 Resort credit. After ""using"" the Resort Credits I was informed that the place I used the Resort Credits wasn't on the list of the participating establishments and there was nothing they could do about that and I was going to pay for that. The only thing they could do to me was add an extra $100 Resort Credit and allow me to check-out at 5pm.  That did not solve my problem but I took it.  3 days later I check my account and there's a charge of $280.  I can't go back there because I live on the East coast so I tried to call and email them but got no response. They do not pickup calls or respond emails. Billing detail takes up to 7 days. Nothing was solved until now. Just a horrible experience a bunch o misinformation and extra charges with no customer service and nobody to solve issues."
50,Park MGM is a great hotel Non smoking is a plus. First class in every way. Service was excellent. A small fridge in the room would have been nice a breakfast diner type place would have been good just not a fan of Starbucks
40,"A very good location for doing things on the strip. The cost of ""extras"" is over the top after paying the resort fee. We had great service at the pool and bar; quoted a daily rate of $150 for a padded chaise lounge - really?"
50,This was my first time to stay at this hotel and it was a wonderful experience. The staff were friendly and helpful the room was clean and inviting. I would definitely recommend this place to everyone and I will certainly stay here again.
50,One of the cleanest hotels and casinos in vegas! No smoking and a very tight security keeps out the bs. Every machine is clean and covid free wiped down by staff almost after each use. Don't hesitate to book here!!!
50,Excellent casino and hotel! We have stayed at least 5-10 times and it never disappoints! I love that it’s no smoking! And we always win! The security team and always on top of things keeping us safe! The pool was great and we always found a place to sit !
40,Non-smoking is a big plus. The adult pool is a highlight. Primrose is better than Mon Ami Gabi. Eataly is a great place for any time of day eating. The location is outstanding. The food at pool is better than anywhere else.
50,Amazing rooms. Incredible pools including the adults only pool DJ. Definitely staying at Park again. The food at Eataly was simple superb. So many choices and always friendly staff. The Park casino was also very lively… Lots of winnings. And a no smoking hotel… very rare. A must place to stay.
50,Such a relaxing good vibes hotel. Will be our go to for sure. Definitely appreciate the non smoking! The room was nice and spacious. We ended up with a room that had pool view which made it even better. The pool was so relaxing and had awesome margaritas there. Also the food choices at/close to the hotel are awesome!
30,I like that it was non-smoking. The food at the Eatley was wonderful! However beds was not comfortable and just hard to get around. Especially when you want to go outside it’s a long walk from the room to the street
50,From the location the staff the restaurant 10/10. For the second we feel like loyalty here. They really take of you allot. They made sure that everything you needed was in your grasp. The casino floor and staff extremely friendly. Nobody was bothered by you asking questions and we had plenty.
50,Amazing hotel/casino. The location is great. Plenty of restaurants to choose from. The rooms are spacious and clean. Price is great for a family on a budget! Did not use the pool but it looked family friendly
50,Just super good  all the employees are friendly  Good food nice slots  so relaxingget some money  close to the strip easily to check in easy to check out  easy to park the car  nice valet parking
50,Everyone was so freakin helpful and nice. Thank you so much for such a wonderful experience. My only complaint is that the roulette table minimum was too high. The suite we stayed in was super spacious .
50,Nice and clean room friendly staff plenty of accessible gaming and a top notch steakhouse! The only nonsmoking resort on the strip that I’m aware of. My only complaint was the $15 dollar a day parking!
50,It was nice. It’s smells so clean and nice there since it was so smoking  rooms were clean and showers were so nice. The cleaning crew was so nice . My only complaint was the mini bar none of the drinks were cold so there was no point to getting any thing and it was kind of in the way so idk it was inconvenient.
40,The person who checked me in was not friendly. Food prices were too high. No one wants to pay $11.00 for onion ring. Did not like the slot machines but overall our trip was good. Your pools are too small.
50,No technical issues  check in and check out were correct. All issues were handled rapidly. Keys for rooms and elevator never had a problem. Casino staff gave everyone a great time. Left bags for late checkout to end the day. Just a great trip.
50,Check in process was quick and simple they even upgraded my room at no extra cost! The restaurants on the property were expensive but convenient. Will definitely be back soon and will stay more nights than just 3. Thanks park MGM
50,I like the fact that the whole complex is smoke free. I had no luck at the casino all my luck was with the great food and drink. I love staying at this location. We sat at the bar and enjoyed free drinks as we played the poker machines. A great time was had by all.
50,Absolutely perfect! Warm and friendly staff and clean room. We had a group of ten guys that went out for the WSOP and stayed at the Park MGM we loved the “smoke free” environment! Even though we left a couple bucks at the table we’d go back in a minute.
50,Beautiful hotel and casino. I love the nonsmoking atmosphere. All the people I dealt with working there were very happy and upbeat. Very nice stay. I also left with more money than I brought which was quite the bonus!
50,Love the fact the hotel is Smoke free. Pool is nice and relaxing and great food conveniently located on site. The staff everywhere we went was attentive and friendly. Lastly parking garage is conveniently located within reasonably walking distance from rooms.
50,Beautiful hotel super clean and restaurants are too die for you get a variety of different options too eat from also the pools are super clean and very relaxing great environment to go with significant other
50,Great room was in the middle of everything. Easy check in and check out. We ate in the restaurants at park several times all good especially Eataly. Easy access to Aria which was great to play poker.
10,The room was disgusting. There was hair in our shower. The towels has smushed dead bugs. There were spot on the sheets. Our neighbors were very loud. We stayed out of the hotel because we weren’t excited to go back. And house keeping just folded our wet towels. The $300 fee was not in the itinerary. I will not be coming again.
50,The Park MGM was very comfortable and accommodating for 6 women celebrating milestone birthdays! The rooms and suites are beautiful. We loved the smoke free casino restaurants and hotel rooms. The staff was fun!
50,ALl staff treated us like royalty!!! The hotel is located near the strip so an easy walk. I had a good night's sleep on wonderful bed & pillows. Layout of hotel shops restaurant's & casino easy to navigate
50,The smoke free environment is a really big plus! You or your clothes do not smell like smoke. One can actually breath without coughing after going to the casino. It's a much healthier environment.  The choice of food is great. From Bavettes Steakhouse  Lala Noodle  Eataley  even Side Bettys Grill.
10,Stay here if you like:  1) Rooms furnished by an oompa loompa (room walls/furniture were green and bright red).    2) Dingy and dark guest hallways that make you feel unsafe and think the lighting is intentional to hide the dirty carpeted floor.    3) to wait 20 minutes to get in/out of the hotel parking    4) or don't need to get any help from the front desk as their lines snake like an amusement park ride every day we were there    5) Even the suites were unfurnished they were large but felt like an empty box with little furniture - living area was like a wreck room at the YMCA.
50,The non-smoking casino makes such a big difference for the quality of your stay. Every other casino on the strip makes you feel like you need a shower just from walking through it. Amazing food options great staff.
40,I enjoyed my time at this hotel and is a good break from the party crowed further down the strip. It's the perfect hotel for couples and would stay here again. Only down side I can think of is that there are now cheap casual laste night options for food inside the hotel.
50,Reasonable price  great location  free train to aria bellagio hotel walking distance to Coca Cola m&m store  nice staff  one min walking to abc store buying cheap bottle of water  all things around  only the house keeping not very clean .
50,I loved being able to do the self check in thru the app. Walking in there was a pleasant smell to the hotel.  You do have to pay for parking unfortunately. $15 over night parking not to bad but just a heads up
50,Was a little nervous due to other reviews I'm truly glad I didn't change my mind. This hotel was great. I will definitely be returning in the future. Employees were very friendly and helpful 🙂 😊 🙂
50,Great location price and amenities! Would stay again for sure! The rooms were clean and comfortable. Shower was amazing!! Large Casino and many options for food and drinks. The pool was great and staff was very helpful and friendly and service was top notch.
50,We stayed at the Park MGM on a whim to be near the Hello Kitty Café and are so glad we did. The room was smaller than most on the strip but perfect for our small family. The location is close to so many things so that we didn't have to walk around too much on the strip. Finding Eataly was the gem of the trip and I'd go back and stay for that place any day.
50,What a hidden gem of a casino. Smack dab on the strip back roads to escape the traffic. Clean air beautiful rooms good food & friendly staff look no further people!!  Truly a wonderful Las Vegas hotel/casino.
50,Great hotel and food! Easy to get to and has a free tram that takes you to the Bellagio. Eat at Sally Grill they have amazing food for a great price too. The casino is a bit small but a lot of food options.
40,This hotel was nice but I am not sure I would stay here again. I feel that most of my issues were personal so others may not be bothered but we definitely were.  PROS: large room friendly staff no smoking in the casino super clean great restaurants good views and pretty central location on the strip.  CONS: the cleaners they used were very harsh!! Our floor and couch were still wet on arrival and the cleaner was overpowering!! We had to prop the door open and it still was hard to breathe. This cleaner must be used everywhere cause it was overpowering throughout the casino. THIN WALLS!!! We heard every single word (and more) going on in the rooms beside us and hallway.  Multiple disturbances from housekeeping minibar etc. We did not have a do not disturb sign and we are day sleepers. Housekeeping was told 3 different times no thank you minibar stocking lady could be heard banging on every door halfway down the hall!!  Minimal decorations and kinda gloomy color scheme. It was nice but not super inviting and exciting.  So it is a nice place just not for me.
50,Great hotel with very nice rooms love the rooms and closeness to the strip. Just a few steps away from the T Mobile arena literally right across the street. On our visit it was 108 but the walk across the street was a piece of cake. The strip is just outside place.
10,We booked the hotel through AAA  Apparently they went out if they way to give us the worst room.  First the hotel floor is old and tired.  The room smelled like mold and ac didn’t work    The room is old and tired  I have stayed at better motel 6s    Don’t stay Go to the Hyatt place
40,This hotel has a great location and is walking distance to restaurants and stores. We loved that the casino was smoke free. The rooms are nice and modern. The only negative thing I could say is that the room could’ve been cleaner. Other than that we would definitely stay here again.
40,Had a great experience! Small design issues with our shower and sink backup but overall a great place. Loved the restaurant there and eatery area. Location was great too. We will return if we see an upcoming trip to Vegas again.
50,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Park MGM. The non-smoking hotel/casino was the reason we chose this particular hotel & it was a great decision. All staff we interacted with were very pleasant and helpful. The mobile check in process was very easy & convenient. Having the mobile app was convenient and very useful. The hotel/casino was clean and organized. The (3) pools were great and we never had an issue with finding a chair/umbrella. The complimentary water was a nice surprise and very refreshing. The gym had enough equipment for a daily workout. If we visit Vegas in the future - we will definitely choose Park MGM. Highly recommend to anyone visiting the strip.
50,We had a great 3 day getaway pools were really nice restaurants good nice location for where we had to go. Only issue no fridge or microwave in room. Either one would do with kids. I’ll definitely be staying here again.
40,Stayed at Park MGM for 4 nights we had free MyVegas rewards and booked our rooms. I was a bit worried but I was definitely wrong.    The check in service was quick. The front desk person was amazing and helpful.    We had a room in the Nomad section the room was very nice clean and comfortable. The bathroom was simple and nice I expected worse. Our room look out view was not bad at all we saw the NYNY roller coster.    The hotel itself is situated in a perfect area no long walking to the strip and the shopping area is just across the road. I give this 100 for location wise.    The casino is so clean I love the fact its a non smoking area. The other casinos were awful with the weed and cigarettes scent.    The pool area isn't the best but not bad to take a swim at least one of the days. The hotel decor is simple and beautiful. The best part too is that the rideshare is just out the elevator not much walking.
50,Even though my wife and I only stayed one night I wish it was more. My next travel to Las Vegas I will definitely stay at this property. Very clean location great and checkin and parking easy. The room was clean shower was huge and nice room size was big. Only wish we could have a refrigerator. Would be nice if Starbucks was open 24/7.
50,Stellar staff quality dining clean beds clean baths and very diverse. The location is perfect as well as parking and both retail and entertainment was amazing. The value for the price couldn’t be better.
50,Had an amazing stay at the Park MGM. Birthday girls trip. Great location on the strip. Friendly staff clean rooms spacious rooms great Casino. Will definitely choose Park MGM during our next visit to Vegas!
50,Room safe was not working. Called front desk. Vince/Lisa came up to fix. It was a little more extensive. so they called maintenance and was fixed in no time. It made us feel that we were taken care of.
50,We would like to take a little time and personally Thank Hank Graae. He is extremely helpful and courteous. He came over and was checking on us asked a few questions truly has a passion with the guests. Again w wanted to make sure that he is recognized for a great job done…Hank thank you again.
20,Room was hot and smelled like weed hard to smell like that ever night so disappointed don’t book me next to smokers or keep the rooms colder somehow hard time sleeping . Staff did alright just the rooms sucke disappointed
10,The best at the hotel was the security person who has pretty good test on wines.  Hank Graac.  Thank you Hank for your guidance.  I will recommend to stop by at eataly is a very good place to eat. And a great selection of Italian wines.  If you need help with the wines you can talk to Hank he will help you a lot.
40,The hotel is very nice and clean room perfect size and the amenities very nice: pool bars restaurants and the casino. I love the eataly area a lot of places to choose. The hotel location really good you can go either north or south of the strip walking to the nearby hotels
50,Absolutely loved that our favorite The Monte Carlo is now The Park! Non- smoking made it especially comfortable. Service was excellent. Everyone so pleasant and accommodating. We need to give a special shout out to the staff at The Primrose where we enjoyed brunch in the drawing room every day we were there. and also special thanks to Amayda G. - the housekeeping floor supervisor who made sure our stay was also perfect! Definitely our first choice when returning to Vegas!
50,Getting a Room close to the elevator helps to cut down on the walking when headed back to the room on a hot Vegas day. Also not having to breathe in all that smoke in the casino at ParkMGM is the bonus over all the other casinos nearby. We found ourselves constantly removing ashtrays and used glasses at the other casinos but not ParkMGM they’re staff continuously clean and it shows and is truly appreciated by this family.
20,Great Hotel... the Casino Staff was terrible. Probably the most cranky and attitude filled dealers. She even told our table to come back later when she was not working. I also had to wait 20 mins for a seat to open. But I understand the short staffing. Had a much better experience at Caesars Property the next 3 nights instead. ParkMGM is a great clean hotel though. Just not to play at....I guess
40,Nice location in the middle of the strip which made it easy to visit a lot of hotels and casinos. Didn’t have to go outside to get something to eat with several nice restaurants and nice beds and good showers
50,Besides the incredible selection of restaurants pool and spa amenities the fact that this is the only smoke-free casino is why I will only ever stay here in the future. Not sure why other places haven’t seen the demand for this but Park MGM gets my business forevermore.
30,Still showing same interior design in hallways to when we went there under Monte Carlo so no cosmetic upgrades at all. Room was too basic even for a comp. No fridge no coffee not even a proper place to put in room snacks just a warning if you move them you bought them. I could put a shirt on and have to sleeve catch one of these items and now I bought it. The only cabinet anywhere in the room was the inwall safe.
50,I absolutely loved the Park MGM. Ever since they opened I’d been wanting to stay there but for one reason or another just hadn’t. I’m glad I did this time. The hotel is super cute the room was very nice and the staff was great. Also very family friendly.
50,From check-in to check-out I received top notch service. The facilities were clean and well maintained. There was an excellent variety of food and beverage outlets and I particularly enjoyed my time at On The Record.
50,Absolutely loved staying at this resort. It was a perfect weekend getaway and we rarely wanted to leave the property as we loved all the options at the Park MGM. It felt like it was made for me. It seemed that most of the guests were also in their 30s/40s. The dining options pools casino and rooms were all excellent.
50,While staying in Vegas recently on a remote business trip I was looking for a Las Vegas Golden Knights collared shirt for a conference call the following day. While asking for the location of the Golden Knights' teams store in Park I discovered the store was presently closed. I was helped by Glisel DeLeon (GSR Slots) and Victoria (MGM Park Shoppe) who OPENED the store just for me to select a shirt (and some other souvenirs). This was an absolutely incredible experience that I feel needed to be called out. I can't recall ever seeing this kind of hospitality before. Thank you Glisel and Victoria!!
40,I LOVE the location and non-smoking aspect. Needs mattress upgrade. Eataly has many food options but not much space. The rooms are mostly quiet but walls are thin….. Would definitely stay here again would stay longer if mattress was better.
50,We came to stay for a long weekend for a birthday trip. We enjoyed the smoke free property. Eataly was wonderful. We spend a day at the pool and it was very nice and fun atmosphere. The Juniper Moon bar was fun to visit as well.
50,Convenient to everything! Great 'smaller' property so getting around is easy! Smoke free casino. Wonderful restaurants! I've stayed in all the bigger properties. My new favorite place is Park MGM! And the proximity to the Dolby Theater and T-Mobile means you can walk to all your entertainment in just a few minutes!
40,"The Park MGM is in a great location and connected to the tram which takes you to the Bellagio. This was helpful for us because we had tickets to ""O"" and the sidewalks were pretty crowded in the evenings. The service was excellent. Everyone from front-desk to bar tenders to the people who did bag check-in were so helpful and friendly. Have a bit of cash for tips. The room was average. Nothing special but good enough. We had a ""strip"" view which was really just a view of the roof. Ask for a NON adjoining room (assuming you're not trying to get one with people you're travelling with). The noise travels very easily between the two rooms if they're adjoining. We were kept up/woken up by music several times (and we had earplugs!)."
40,Nice room though slightly dated. Great value for the money. Excellent proximity to T-Mobile Arena. Good location on the strip with tram service connecting to Bellagio. Swimming pools were a bit crowded but had excellent service. We enjoyed our stay!
30,Average is the best I can come up with. Great location with Target across the street for water booze and snacks and easy enough access to the tram and monorail. But the bed was not very comfortable and we could hear our next door neighbor pulling their curtains. Would I stay here again………………maybe.
50,Loved the location of this property. Everything is within walking distant. Not to mention Eataly which is an Italian food market. Has pizzaseafood freshly made pasta and bread and a fantastic wine selection. The rooms were clean and updated. Very modern and slot choice was extensive plenty of games to choose from. I highly recommend staying here for the location alone.
40,Not much else to say. Bell service was exceptional when needed. Used the self parking with the app and parked at other end of strip to walk that side. Oh... and the water pressure was good when compared to most hotels.
30,I love this hotel. It has a great vibe and a great location. I have been staying at Park MGM for years I have also stayed in every room they offer. The rooms are great for the price. However the beds are not the best. We came this time and stayed in the stay well room which was great aside from the bed. It felt like I was sleeping on concrete. I am usually not one to complain but it was horrible and my back hurt so bad the next day I had to switch to a normal room. They were very accommodating and gave me a $40 dining credit. Once we moved the beds were much better but still not great. If they could fix this issue the rooms would be perfect. Before the pandemic I had never stayed in any room other than the two queen. Since then I have stayed in a king nightingale and a stay well all of which had awful beds. If you plan on staying here and like a softer bed I recommend staying in the two queen.
40,Great place had lots of fun our 3rd year staying with park mgm. Very likely to recommend to other people. We didn’t get into our room right away which was a little frustrating but understanding 10/10
30,For me MGM is a quality brand. I was very disappointed in my visit this June. The receptionist was so unfriendly and look like he was hurry he was rude when I told him that one of the rooms was with king size bed he only told me It is what it is then when we up to our room the carpets in the hall rooms was terrible was very dirty. The room is not bad but nothing surprising. We slept very well and comfortable.
40,Non-smoking property is a big plus. Eataly and the other restaurants in Park MGM are a big hit! Lots of choices to eat! Starbucks is located by the guest elevators is very convenient. Shake shack and Crack shack are just a few steps from the property. The property is close to everything. There is even a CVS located near the property if you ever need it!!
50,Can't wait to come back!!!!!! The entire family enjoyed our stay and we all love the rooms. The hotel if very clean and the food is excellent! Bavettes is a must for fine dinning and cocktails and the food courts eye and palate pleasing.
50,Great location awesome staff and excellent amenities. The entertainment and food options are amazing. The free tram from The Park to Aria Cosmopolitan and Bellagio is perfect on hot days and the pool is clean and relaxing.
20,Bathtub was dirty. Bath curtains had stains. Check in people never told us we had to reprogram our key card because we were a back to back 1 day reservation. Ended up coming back at 3am only to find out I couldn't get in my room. Had to walk all the way back down (way back of hall) go down elevators get it reprogrammed etc. when I could have just reprogrammed it once getting back to the hotel. Vending machine with 3.50 waters on our floor didn't work and the hotel wanted $18 for a mini Fuji water from the mini bar. Concierge people on the phone also had slight attitude when you ask for accomodations.
50,Staff attentive and nice  Pool/ Cameron also security from pool and Mr Gerardo from serving Tacos at pool area  House keeping very nice ladies and polite  Front desk very informative  Outside older gentleman having control on traffic/ people and Taxis he is Awesome
50,Very clean and loved my stay! Definitely coming to the Park Mgm again! Staff was very friendly and we loved that we were able to leave our bags after checkout to enjoy more of Vegas. We loved all the food options at Park Mgm.
50,The Nightingale Suite was just right in size - 4 woman 2 QB's Pullout sofa banquette window seating w/table. Full counter & bar sink. Separate toilet room from shower & vanity sink...a necessity when traveling with several people. Hotel offers everything in one spot. Additional stores real close by. Staff was fantastic! Best Friends a fun dinner atmosphere! Toscano was good but slow service. Eataly offers everything Italian food court style. Primrose Eggs Benedict perfection every time ordered! Just wish it had been a more money winning trip! Thanks Park MGM
50,We have always enjoyed staying at the Park MGM. It’s centrally located with tram access to the Bellagio. The rooms are spacious with an oversized walk-in shower. The Employees at Park MGM are experts in Customer Service and want to ensure you have the best experience during your stay.  This trip we had an unexpected emergency. The staff at Park MGM went above and beyond to ensure we were taken care of while we were dealing with our emergency situation.
40,I appreciate the high end food options but would like more of an affordable food court. Especially at the end of the night when you would want a quick snack. But overall the property was very nice and luxurious.
40,Nice place to stay. Short distance to walk to the main attractions. Friendly staff. Rooms are dated. Need some attention. Food area quaint expensive and I saw only Italian option. Nice swimming pool. Probably will return there.
40,This is the only all non-smoking hotel and casino in Vegas. The room was nice bigger than a typical room. The bathroom was also fairly large with a nice tiled shower. The room was clean. We were able to check-in on the MGM app which was quick and easy. That was nice so we didn't have to wait in line to check in.
50,We stay at Park MGM every time we visit Vegas. The casino is very quaint and classy (along with the restaurants and bars). The rooms are cute and beds are comfortable. The other huge bonus is that Park is a sample free casino!
50,Great one night stay great location very nice rooms comfortable beds and pillows we had a great time the casino smells very good no smoking friendly staff we had a great time. Lots of choices for food.
20,Quick check-in. But the room was dated and the bathroom had hair in the sink and shower upon arrival. The room itself did have a large couch big enough for a fifth person to sleep if needed. I liked having Eataly in the hotel. The room itself was cheap. Probably would not stay again though.
50,I like the vibe of park MGM. It feels more relaxed than one of the more party-oriented resorts. I like the ambiance and aesthetic of the hotel all of the park/forest motifs really lend to the sense of tranquility. And their Italian market Eataly was superb. One of these times I will branch out and try another of the restaurants here.
40,we went for our sons 30th birthday celebration. everything was so close by and readly available. you come off the elevators and a few feet away was Starbucks then when you exit the elevators to the left is the pool. loved how convenient everything was.
20,Property is in need of refreshing. Not well maintained stains on furniture and ripped up carpet. Technical problems (TV not working) take a very long time to be fixed. Not a very good selection on the MGM Brand.
40,Seriously just charge more because the resort fee is ridiculous! The pool wasn’t open so what resort part am I using? Loved the non smoking room and the view was amazing. No coffee in room which is just basic. Oh and the sheets were horrible I’m not a fan of the stiff squeaky poorly fitting sheets.
50,I love this hotel because its non smoking and the location is excellent. There are lots of good places to eat The hotel is very clean smells so good .The rooms are clean and the bed is comfortable The slot machines are good.
50,From the minute we checked in the staff was courteous and the resort had a lot to offer. We love this resort because of the location and the bars lounges and of course Eataly. So much to do and in the middle of the best part of the strip. A must go when we visit Las Vegas.
50,Great experience. Would definitely recommend. Had an amazing view and the pizza at eatily was amazing. Great burger at the sports bar. Nice to stay somewhere that’s smoke free. And has a great variety of game.
40,Like the fact the entire property is non smoking. Rooms are no frills no coffee makers no place to store cloths except for suitcase (there is a place to hang cloths). Hotel is a bit of a distance from the main strip. Dining is ok not much open late.
50,This was my surprise Mother’s Day gift from my husband and children a trip to Vegas for a long weekend and to see a show. It became a mother/daughter getaway and this hotel was perfect. The Park MGM was a great location for us. The entertainment venues were close plenty of restaurants pools casino and the Tram over to the Bellagio was ideal. On my next visit with hubby we will stay here again!
50,This is the first time I have stayed here since they changed the Hotel from Monte Carlo to MGM Park. I really enjoyed going to a hotel and casino and not having to breathe in second hand smoke all day and night. Great location on the Strip.    Food selection is good and tasty in the open market and the rooms are nice and clean.
40,One star experience made better by an awesome housekeeping host Catherine.    We checked in today and found our room filthy dirty and the sheets looked like they had never been changed out with stains and particles on the sheets...ugh so grossed. When we called the front desk they didn't sound apologetic or cared ...Just said someone would come later and hung up.    Finally after about 45 minutes Catherine came knocking on the door. She was so friendly and so sympathetic for our situation. We chatted as she helped us switch out our sheets and the pillow cases. I really appreciate her friendliness and willingness to make things right. She didn‘t treat us like whiny guests or that we had inconvenienced her created extra work for her and was so understanding and fun to talk to. I wish Park MGM realize how rare an employee like her is  especially in time like this with labor shortage and seems like half of the people could care less about making the company look good.    I really wanted to give the hotel a 1 star for the cleanliness of the room (or lack of) besides the fact that shower door doesn‘t sealed and we have wet bathroom after shower etc. But Catherine tried so hard to make it right based on the experience we have with her i am willing to give the hotel another chance and give it a 4-star.
50,I've stayed at Park Mgm twice and this hotel smells great due to it being smoke free! The guest rooms are super clean which is very important! The beds are very soft and comfortable. It is a great hotel for families too! The location is perfect since your able to walk to surrounding hotels like New York New York and Excalibur!
10,I stayed in Room 218 19th floor and it was terrible. The carpet was disgusting the shower tub had a vinyl shower curtain held up by some sort of chains and wouldn't stay in-place. The restaurant's are great though.
50,Love this place! The location is great in the middle of everything. Which makes it great to walk with my family. We love Eataly! Great drinks! The food is amazing! We love Park MGM we will definitely come back as soon as we can!
40,Loved that it was a non-smoking hotel. There is no clock and the bathroom/closet door was heavy and made a loud bang. The sink didn’t drain well as it wasn’t tilted towards the drain. Toto toilets were great.  Beds were too soft and low. No fridge.  Shower had great water pressure.
50,We were here with 3 adults (grandma mom dad 8 yr old 4 yr old). Perfect stay! Pools are awesome. No problem finding seats. Great restaurants. Rooms are on the smaller side but very comfortable. Loved it!
10,I stayed at park mgm because they offered me free room credit and all I had to do was put it as room charge. I just checked my credit card and the hotel charged me credit card… so what happened to my free room credit? Never staying there again.
30,Rooms need updated no coffee machine and no fridge. Hotel clean good view and location. The food w was good inside and free tram other casinos. Good walking distance to Las Vegas strip and shopping across the street
50,Excellent choice. Smoke free. A great location. Great restaurants..ask for Jesse at Primrose! Clean safe and secure. Pools are AMAZING!  Although Aerosmith cancelled on us:( the Dolby theatre is attached so you can find a close place for a show.
10,zero sound insulation between rooms could hear all and everything that went on in next rooms and hallways. room was missing fully stocked bathroom items. cleaned subpar easily noticeable that was not fully vacuumed.
40,The hotel location is great. We walked everywhere. The beds and room were basic but did the job. The food options were pretty limited. Eataly was good when it was open. We ended up buying most of our food at other casinos.
50,This hotel is very convenient to all events dining and gambling. I really like that the entire hotel and casino is non smoking. As part of the MGM properties it was very nice to be able to earn points during the stay.
30,Pros: Non-Smoking Resort Location-great: close to NyNy Hello Kitty Cafe TMobile Arena 3 Pool Areas Great Selection of Italian Food & Best Friend Restaurants Starbucks & Nomad -another hotel in the resort. Ride Share location is great!    Cons: No fridge/cooler/microwave in the room Rooms are average not a lot of “stores” slot selection is minimal no 24 hr Room Service & a smaller casino.
40,I got comped room but the slots were too tight and it ended up costing me way more. The house wins again. The hotel was pretty good. They did not upgrade my room as requested but that’s ok. My room was decent. I view was mostly the roof over the casino. The location is also great. Can’t complain much.
50,I love our stay it was incredible! This casino is by far the best on the strip. Most of our friends stayed at aria and would walk over but I think next year everyone’s going to make the switch. I know where I’m staying!
50,We stayed at the Nomad tucked away at the Park MGM. The room and the service were excellent! We had wonderful food also! We revisited the wine place in little Eataly a couple of times. They had a great wine tasting at happy hour for a very decent price. Sitting on the couch tasting our wine was wonderful We had a charcuterie board to enjoy the wine with! The security guard at the wine tasting was very friendly and helpful with directions etc. His name was Hank. I liked that the Nomad itself was a little smaller and I was usually able to fine my way around. A very enjoyable experience all the way around!
50,From start to finish Park MGM never disappoints. from the gorgeous smell upon entry to the ease of parking and Check In this hotel is better than most in that it's very easy to navigate. The non smoking aspect makes for a more ZEN experience
50,This hotel was a real surprise to my wife and I. The location is unmatched and the access to great hotels is just as good. We loved our stay here. Great rooms smoke free casino and we won 2k. We will be returning. The one thing that could be better is more check in and check out attendants.
10,I usually have great experience at MGM properties but this one was horrible my first room was dirty and had sewer smell coming from the brown water went down stairs spoke wit MGR (Walter) he was nice and they switch me to another room went out and came back few hours later and the TV just stop working went back down there and they sent somebody up that fix the TV but I shouldn't have to go through this ..
50,Rate this a 5 star. I had no experience checking in at the counter and getting to the hotel. Everything was prepared for us. Staffs were very kind to us and the pool was enjoyable. Overall would recommend to a friend or come back again.
50,Everything was good no complaints. A minor mistake with reservations but it got fixed. Rooms was very refreshing and price was good. I would recommend staying here for another visit. everything was good
50,Very clean and smells smoke-free. Rooms are very nice. Love the bed pillows and beddings.  Check-in and check-out was easy. Garage to the elevator is not a far walk unlike other hotels. Best Vegas hotel for me now.
50,We have stayed here in the past on a personal trip. Love that it is a non-smoking casino. Staff has always been very helpful and professional. Location is awesome as well. Would highly recommend Park MGM.
40,Enjoy the smoke free casino. There are many amazing dining experiences available. There are lots of sports betting kiosk so you don’t need to stand in line to make your bets.  The room was spacious and very comfortable. Would definitely stay there again.
50,Shout out to Hank Graae in security for being so hospitable!!! I came to Park MGM for one night and Hank was nice enough to to give me the low down on all the things to do and eat at the Hotel. He’s probably one of the friendliest security guards I have ever met. Big ups to him!
50,Love the ParkMGM! Great staff great food great location! While the rooms are the fanciest on The Strip they are clean comfortable and very good sized. The food & options are great! We ADORE Bavettes Steakhouse; La Pizza & La Pasta has the BEST Spaghetti Cacio e Pepe; the Eataly bars all make a killer Aperol Spritz; and you can’t go wrong with ANY cocktail at Juniper Cocktail Lounge. Can’t wait for our next visit!
50,Love how clean the hotel was it smelled like roses. 😊 the bed and pillows were great too. Pools were very nice. The food was delicious!! We will be back again. Room service was very nice gave us extra towels and shampoo
40,The overall stay was good. I did not encounter the amount of problems I have experienced in some of my other out of town stay. The scenery was excellent my question were always answered except for rewards experience
40,Very nice resort. Great rooms nice pools lots of dining (dinner) options. Bavette’s LaLa Noodle the Italian Eatery all great places Could use more breakfast options but Primrose restaurant is nice. Conveniently located on the Strip. Love that the casino is smoke free! And that they have limited use of automatic card shufflers. The entire Staff was very efficient and friendly - how often do you make friends with blackjack dealers? - Thelma Ambrose Nathan Etti etc. (one of them even remembered our group from our stay the previous year). Special shout out to Pit Boss Steven Cartel - so friendly and helped our kids get into a concert after-party at the resort. Floor Manager Bobby Cugini is the ultimate professional on running a tight ship in the early morning hours. And Maryann Adesoro (Concierge) helped arrange the entire trip and was extremely accommodating with multiple changes in plans. We’ve been to many resorts on the Strip but Park MGM may be our favorite.
50,I really enjoyed my stay at the Park MGM. I haven’t been here since they upgraded the property and I was truly impressed. Super convenient to other areas on the strip and no smoking in the casino. Can’t beat that!
50,Enjoyed how close this is to everything plus having the free tram to Bellagio is a plus for when you want to go center strip. This part of the strip seems cleaner and less homeless people once we hit Ceasers it just gets really bad
50,Non-smoking hotel. Great for the family trip especially who are with kids. Eataly is inside the hotel which gives you lots of choice for lunch and dinner. Love the pool area and restaurants and location of the hotel.
50,Clean smoke free and wonderful staff! We live staying here and have been multiple times!!  Location on strip is perfect. Near Bellagio city center and t-mobile arena. easy to get to other hotels around!
50,Rooms are very clean casino is clean as well because there is no smoking which is the best feature easy to navigate hotel pool area clean and elegant park feature. Staff was very friendly and helpful
40,Park MGM does not disappoint. The rooms are super clean and comfortable. The sofa against the wall is a nice touch.    The casino is spectacular and has play levels for all budgets. A seat at any table game is easy to find. The craps table get crowded but the energy from them is incredible.    By far one of my favorite MGM if not Vegas in general properties to stay eat and play.
50,Friendly and helpful staff. Clean rooms. 3 Pools. Centeral location. Convenient check-in with the MGM Resorts app. I lost my room key but I was able to use my phone as a room key instead. With the MGM Rewards program it was a Comp Room with Free Parking.
50,Wanted to stay on the Strip and this hotel was in the perfect location. Not overly expensive for a Strip-facing room and the interior is modern and updated. Love the smoke free casino and Eately (restaurant inside) was great. Very helpful staff and contactless check out. Clean and not too crowded. A lot of hotels have older non-updated rooms but this one was definitely modern. Glass shower mounted movable TV and Bluetooth sound bar. Would definitely go back.
40,Room service is not 24 hours so that’s a limiting factor if you are arriving late or working during the week. Not a lot of non-expensive options for eating in the hotel and many restaurants are closed much of the time. Hotel is clean and in a good location. Staff is friendly and helpful.
50,Loved starting day and ending the day in a non smoking hotel. Enjoyed The Eatly with the variety of food and loved La La Noodle. Right across from Park where we sat and had our coffee every morning by the water wall.
10,Ac doesn't work. Doesn't even have a fridge. I ask for soap they keep forgetting it. Also your restaurant primrose is racist. One of your server thought we didn't have enough money for her tips. So she never checked up on us even once.
40,Good room to rest  comfortable bed shower pressure was awesome  all the amenities were there for the travelers. My conference was in the same building. The restaurants were good . I liked the swimming pool especially one that was only for adults.
20,The Park has a decent location and it’s non-smoking—great. Also great Bavettes is here. And the shower is strong—and warm because there is a door. However the rooms are bare bones with not enough closet or dresser space for two people to unpack—and since it’s Vegas you know we didn’t bring much. Additionally the bed sheets were dirty or stained. Disgusting.
50,Best customer experience out there. Pool staff is just amazing. Tell Sunflower we said hi and get an amazing adult beverage. Rooms are about average but let’s be honest you don’t spend a lot of time in your room anyway. Restaurants (specifically Best Friend) are next level. Can’t wait to come back
30,"We were here to celebrate my sister's wedding. Everything was great but the service fell well short of basic goals. Nobody communicated everyone seemed to want to leave immediately. Just two minutes per service rendered and then another person comes to fix it or try. The sink backed up and needed 3 attempts to fix it. The shower drained slowly but nothing was done and I won't even mention the toilet issues. Nevertheless everything else was great non-smoking and the pool is fantastic. Just pray you don't get a room that needs sinks or toilets snaked. Almost everyone in our party had sink issues. Little things matter. Like even offering some sort of compensation for your ""sanctuary"" being compromised. But hey - Vegas right?"
50,Very nice business accommodations pool very nice with adult only area that is very nice fun and relaxing. Easy access to Aria and tram for visiting rest of the strip. Food also very good in hotel. No being covered in smoke smell was the best. Room are dark for sleeping and king bed was very comfortable!
40,Park MGM is at the center location on the Las Vegas strip. Just a short distance to other resorts such as Mandalay Bay MGM New York Aria Paris etc. Lot of dinning shows and shops around the area.
10,Call the front desk and ask them for San one cleaning the room and no one come to clean try to get another room and then it’s more money for the resort feast and more money for deposit and now nobody fix the
50,Nice hotel rooms are okay. I don’t care for the carpet hallways are dark. But the rooms were comfortable/clean. I like the style they were going for but it could’ve been a bit more modern. Overall not bad for the price. It’s not in the center of everything but it’s close enough. The hotel lobby and restaurants are good. The front desk was helpful. The casino wasn’t bad either.
50,I've been multiple times to this hotel and always has been a great experience modern fresh amazing balanced minimalist modern decor. Smoke free great casino and restaurants. LOVE the easy fast self checking. I check in in my app and truly zoom in to the room. I understand why some older generation people may have an issue with all this technology or style but I love it all. A great location and great pricing 10/10
10,I was ok with the tiny worn out room. Not what I expected from a recently remodeled property but it is what it is.  I picked this place because it’s a non smoking hotel and casino. Looked nice in photos good location.  We checked in after a long flight and I was anxious for sleep- too tired to wish I was somewhere else when I realized it was not what I thought. That’s until I noticed makeup on the sheets as I was preparing to pull back the sheets. It smeared when I touched it. In the bathroom the sink was also not clean and there was fresh mascara makeup on the counter. I grabbed a tissue to wipe it off. But the bathtub! Nasty and curly hair in the tub. Obviously not cleaned after the last guests.  As of now the front desk stated they can’t move us because there’s no other rooms and we’ve been waiting an hour for clean sheets.  I just want to go to bed it’s well after midnight here. Guess I’ll sleep in the one chair and get out of here asap tomorrow.  As many times as I’ve stayed in Vegas I’ve never stayed in a room that was unclean nor with such poor service.  Not worth the money. I wouldn’t stay here if it were free. I’m concerned about health safety now. If they didn’t clean the room it’s likely it wasn’t sanitized. THAT concerns me. I’m a cancer survivor and immune compromised. I read their “policies” online before I booked.  The whole world is in need of labor- but whoever did this room made the bed put in fresh towels.  I’m not sleeping in a bed someone else obviously used.  Shame in the hotel management for not moving us.  FYI- in room bottle of water is $18.
40,The hotel was very clean and overall very sanitary and well organized. I just feel that the staff was pretty disinterested or at least inconverned by any of my questions ir concerns. I would stay again if the opportunittt arose as i frequent vegas alot of work but the staff could use some training. Id love to come back and change my mind.
50,Very clean and the bathroom was nice. And location is cery convenient for us. Our room has a view of the pool which is nice. Loving it so much! Check in was a breeze with their apps and plus check out was breeze too. The digital key was very convenient for me.
30,Our room smelt like skunk weed. I borrowed some fabreeze from a cleaning servant and sprayed the room myself. The self check was easy but when we got to our room the keys didn’t work. Annoying. So I had to go back down to check in and wait in line again
50,Loved this hotel especially the fact that it’s non smoking. The staff was great and the rooms were clean and nice. When we did have a problem with the neighbors the manager took care of us and upgraded our room for the inconvenience
50,SMOKE-FREE!  It was great not to have to endure smoking inside the resort. Great food and drink options onsite and great location to walk to other resorts. Also a tram to locations north on the strip so you can avoid a long walk in the Vegas heat.
50,Great value and restaurants and staff. Love the no smoking and relaxed vibe here. Best food court in the country. It’s a great place to relax and enjoy Vegas away from the chaos of the other casinos that can wear you out after a day or two.
50,Rooms are clean and beds are comfortable. Entire hotel/casino smells amazing and had a great vibe. Location is perfect on the strip making for an easy walk to everywhere we wanted to go. One big plus was there weren't timeshare people bothering us.
50,Recently stayed from May 23-26 2022. This hotel was spotless and believe me I am very picky! The casino was also spotless. Everyone we encountered was kind and courteous. We will be back! Park MGM is my go too in Vegas forthcoming..I loved the non-smoking casino and park like atmosphere Dolbly theater experience was awesome! We saw Silk Sonic and they did not disappoint.
50,This hotel has great food and comfy beds with black out blinds. It is totally non smoking. It is so nice to be in a smoke free casino. All the staff was very friendly. Lots of great new slot machines and lots of tables.
30,The room was mediocre i was given one with a shared door and could feel the other party constantly. Bed was awful my back has never felt so much pain. The staff was nice albeit i never talked to anyone more than a few seconds for direction.
30,Housekeeping wasn’t up to standard. There was urine around the base of the toilet prior to us entering the room. I asked them to clean and it was still there. The floor was full of pet hair as well as the sheets
40,Overall a good stay. Our toilet was clogged the day of our arrival but the staff took care of to ASAP… rooms aren’t the best decorated but still comfortable stay. Great non smoking option for families
40,My family had a great stay at the Park MGM. The hotel is centrally located the rooms were clean and the hotel interior was smoke free. The food choices were good and the staff was friendly and courteous.
30,I booked a strip view room. To only be given a view of the BACK OF Ny Ny and the T-Mobile Arena. That is not the strip at all in any kind of way. The Nomad Hotel is the actual wing that has the strip views. No refund or credits offered for inconvenience or deception
50,The casino is very easy to navigate through and the fact I can breathe normally was a big benefit. I could actually taste my drinks and not worry about the smoke taste. It was something so small but made a big difference to my experience.
10,The hotel room wasn’t clean. The bathroom sink was very dirty as was the shower floor. The vent in the bathroom was also literally overflowing with dust and dirt. There was a random llama sticker on our window in the room…. The waitresses on gaming floor were very rude bordering on hostile. I will say Eataly was a good experience the staff there was very nice
20,This hotel was great when they first opened but continues to go down hill with each visit. The rooms are dated and musty and i got an embarassing room this trip with a view of the air conditioner. The pool is not a typical MGM experience. Avoid this place
40,Nice property smoke free and very clean. Good selection of slots with mixture of minimums. Not a lot of table games but sufficient. The Eatly food court offers a variety of Italian fare for reasonable prices. Not a lot of choices for up scale dining.
50,An oasis of calm in the middle of Las Vegas. The rooms are fantastic and there is a great selection of really cool bars inside. The breakfast at Primrose is great especially if you get outside seating.    The addition of the Eatly section provides a great selection of food and the main strip is only a short walk away
50,I enjoy Las Vegas quite a bit. I used to travel to Vegas 3-4 times a year for fun and work. This is the nicest place I have stayed on the strip. Great food Non-smoking and great staff. I recommend eating at Eataly and Best Friend.
50,Staff was great nothing to complaint about.  I had a great time loved the hotel for first time I was amazed.parking was also easy. Micah at VIP needs a raise I was not the only person who was happy with her
10,Motel grade rooms - the key stop working many times - sick was flooded and dust all over the table and sides - service desk cares about your payment only - nothing entertaining and no restaurants inside
50,This was my first visit since MGM Park changed from the Monte Carlo days. The room was a great experience. Cashier in the casino were helpful in helping me cash out a sportsbook winning ticket after the sportsbook was closed for the night. Very easy to zip in and out with the MGM Resorts app. Do your self a favor and use it to skip the lines at check-in. Would highly recommend and visit again in the near future. Very close to the strip The Park and NY NY.
40,Always stayed in the Grande before and this had the same feel on a smaller scale. It was enjoyable and in a very nice location. The Uber/Rideshare/Shuttle area was well-organized and easy to navigate. The casino itself seemed okay.
50,This trip was really great. The staff was very patient and helpful when we were confused or lost. The area is perfect. It is connected to the aria so we didn’t have to walk in the heat 106°! We used the Starbucks downstairs which was convenient. The New York New York across the street has plenty of fast food options which was easy when on the go.
10,It is a terrible casino. Bathroom drain stinking. Foul smell from the drain. Front desk phone not working. Dirty carpets . Terrible checkout experience 3 hours standing in multiple  Queues . Staff is new and do not know how to resolve issues .
50,Everyone we had interaction with especially Brewster from Security made our trip much more enjoyable than expected. We were pleased with the smoke-free casino restaurants and cleanliness of the hotel. We really enjoyed the variety of coffees in the hotel as well as the cabanas at the pool!
40,Have not stayed here since Monte Carlo days it was very enjoyable. Much improved the only thing I miss was the lazy river. However the new improvements out way the old Monte Carlo. It was nice to finally have maid service some of the other hotels do not. We stayed downtown at the golden nugget and they have really gone downhill. So needless to say next time we will return to the strip. This is the first time I have paid for a room in awhile with Caesar’s diamond club I never paid so we will see how this goes.
50,This was our first time staying at Park MGM. Park MGM is 100% smoke free and smaller scale than the huge casinos on the strip. Our room was clean and up to date. The service from the moment we arrived until we left was the best. We ate dinner at Roy Choi Best Friend Restaurant. Roy Choi was GREAT! My wife is still talking about how much she enjoyed our trip. We will definitely be returning soon.
50,Since I moved to the Vegas area I've come to love my little stay-cations on the Strip. Park MGM is a terrific affordable oasis; I think it's the Strip's only smoke-free hotel and casino and I LOVE IT. The color palette of the rooms and public areas is restful and fresh and there are about a zillion places to eat.
30,when i booked this room I did not see that the whole facility is non smoking. the only one on the strip! Atleast it was a quick walk to Aria. Rooms were a lil dingy but it is an old hotel. just a new name!
30,Overall the experience at the Park MGM was good. There wasn't many exciting gaming to be had payouts were poor. Room are nice but dated. Air conditioning on the upper floors tends not to work very well meaning you sleep in a warm room if its hot outside. Good location to the other casinos.
20,I received very poor quality check in experience. later that day I got similarly dry and unwelcoming experience at the bar.  The room was clean and large enough. I could clearly hear other guests and the music outside but that doesn't bother me too much.  Parking charges were inaccurate and so was my housekeeping choices.  Outside of the above I had a decent stay but I the service quality alone and the unwelcoming & transactional interactions with the staff will probably be all I will remember from this hotel.  Nothing personal here but I'm a hospitality professional and automatically have a different perspective when I have a service experience.
50,"The Park MGM is one of my favorite places in Las Vegas. The food available at the Eataly dinning is outstanding and reasonably priced for QUALITY varieties of cured meats and cheeses pasta and pizza to Gelato pastries & desserts of all sorts.  This hotel has the only non-smoking Casino in Vegas which made the experience for a non-smoker incredible! The only place in Vegas that has a ""clean and fresh"" air conditioned Casino. When I looked at the all the staff working at the Roulette & Black Jack tables with people I noticed it was the first time the Dealers were engaged and laughing with the players. I seen the Cashiers smiling as people approached them to cash out their winnings. My boyfriend and I had the BEST time playing at a Roulette table with our Dealers named Corina and Francisco while Kevin was the Manager for their shift. It was because of these genuinely happy & hardworking employees that my Boyfriend and I will ALWAYS return when we visit Las Vegas. This truly was one of my favorite highlights of my trip. Thank you so much for your incredible service to all of you who work at Park MGM!"
50,Park mgm is the best hotel on the strip especially for families. Close to shopping and eateries. Clean and friendly. I have not stayed in another hotel since visiting park. 10/10 recommend Also there pools are amazing! My family and I rented a cabana and it was the best summer experience.
50,A very warm welcome by the front desk staff. They made some great restaurant recommendations!  The rooms were great nice and clean!  Restaurants were excellent Best Freind and Eatly were amazing.  The smoke free environment was very refreshing.
50,Great Room always clean....always ice in ice machine. Only drawback was no room fridge...had to ice beer down in trashcan and keep changing ice....Lo Lo Noodle was the best food I have had in many moons...need to try it for sure
40,I’ve stayed in many Vegas casinos over the years. We enjoyed Park for its size (manageable) and food & gaming selections. We play Pai Gow and we’re happy to find several tables open at most times. The Nomad was a pleasant surprise for food and drinks. More breakfast offerings would be welcome.
50,Love the hotel and casino. Favorite place to stay in Vegas due to the non-smoking environment and free train interconnecting the hotels. Super convenient location and with the train easy to get up and down the strip without breaking a sweat.
50,Our stay was excellent. The room was very clean. The price was great. The location is great. We really appreciate how the resort is smoke free. We are planning a trip back to Vegas because the price was so reasonable.
50,We stayed for 4 nights as a staycation trip and Park MGM impressed us! Overall we liked that it was a no smoking hotel because it was more comfortable for those of us with allergies. The employees at Park MGM were all wonderful from the housekeeping staff to the front desk to even the Starbucks staff. We really enjoyed all of the restaurants and found new favorites at La La Noodle and Primrose and visited old favorites at Aria like Din Tai Fung. It was also really convenient to pop onto the little tram to go to Bellagio to see their new garden exhibit which was nice too. I think that the only thing that detracted from the hotel room was that it didn’t have a mini fridge so we couldn’t bring back leftovers but despite that I think that we will be back again soon!
50,My wife and I had a wonderful stay at the Park. The bed was very comfortable in our King Room and all of the staff were wonderful and friendly. We chose the Park MGM because of the convenience factor since we were in town for the Jonas Brothers' Las Vegas residency at the Dolby LIVE! theater. We enjoyed incredible drinks and delicious meals at all of the restaurants and bars on the property as well as a very fun evening at On The Record especially in the speak easy! We will be back and we you couldn't pay me to stay at another hotel over this one.
50,Really enjoyed staying at this hotel with very clean and spacious rooms. I loved the fact that the entire hotel and casino are smoke-free. The restaurants are fantastic especially Bavettes. I would definitely stay here again.
50,We arrived to the hotel early and we’re able to check in and get into our room by noon. Hotel room was clean and offered enough space for three people. There was no mini fridge to store water which we thought was strange. Room was smoke free. So was the casinos which was a nice surprise. Traveled with my family and we enjoyed the variety of dining options.
40,Someone tried to steal my car and left huge damage to my car door. There is no security at the parking areas. The hotel told me it is not their responsibility for damaged car. It is very sucks that i went here and go back with damaged car.
50,We loved the clean smoke free environment! This hotel is great! This is one of the more family friendly hotels on the strip. The location is excellent! You will enjoy the location cleanliness and no smoke!
30,Stayed at many MGM properties over the years and the Park MGM was a very average stay. The fact that it is completely non-smoking is a huge plus but the casino is small the rooms are small compared to other MGM properties and the food choices are average. The pool complex is better than the NYNY but other than that one property the Park MGM pools are disappointing compared to other MGM properties
50,This was the first time staying at this hotel. I enjoyed the fact the amenities. The silence and the spaciousness of the room. The hotel is located in a perfect spot along the strip. There were so many things to do. I wish I had more time.
50,Love staying here! Staff is nice and love that it is a non smoking hotel! Super convenient to M&M and Hersey World and Coca-Cola Store. Also super close to restaurants and easy access to other hotels. We stayed here to see the Jonas Brothers at the Dolby Live Theater which was at the Park Mgm
50,At the end of the strip near the airport. Connect to restaurants and New York New York . CVS close by and decent Casino. Crack Shack is very good. Staff is very nice and friendly. Nice bell staff And easy Uber pick up
40,Certainly a very good value for money - but rooms are smaller and I will recommend only 2 people max or 2 plus one small kid under 8. You will be bumping on each other if you have more than two. Some rooms look at the T-mobile Arena and the noise and neon signals could be a distraction if you are an early sleeper (even by Las Vegas standards)
50,I very much dislike smoke. Tobacco and especially marijuana. If you’re looking to stay at a place where you’re not inhaling those fumes throughout the duration of your stay in Vegas this is the place to be!
30,Room was clean a little dated but overall good. Great location and the early food court has a great options for all peoples and ages. For the price point it is a great stay. Would recommend to anyone.
50,Love it here! I will always stay here everything is clean staff is exceptional restaurant are amazing!!! Love the games and gambling area. Such a great casino/ hotel. Both my boyfriend and I every time we stay here we are just waiting to come back.
10,I was sent an amazing offer by Park MGM which included hotel free play and some food comp and decided to take them up on their offer. Huge mistake. I’m a gold MGM player and was so disappointed as the room was outdated and extremely small. It wasnt especially dirty but due to the age of the furniture which included the bed I felt very uncomfortable. So much so that we checked out after just one night. The hotel is non smoking which for me was a plus but this is the only nice thing I can say. The elevators were very hot and the hallways are dark and hot as well. Needless to say I won’t ever stay there again.
40,This was my first day at MGM park the hotel was very clean staff was amazing pool was very relaxing very easy to navigate down the strip with the tram overall a great stay would recommend to anyone who’s looking for a non-smoking resort in Vegas
20,Restaurants they make you wait for your entire party to seat you for a meal. So 11 people were left standing while 1 person made their way from the airport. Rooms are dated hot and poorly decorated. The restaurants and food were really good though. The casino looked fun though I didn't play.
30,No room service available. Awful experience! Was told twice to call back at later time due to something happening in the kitchen. We go to Vegas and love to order room service after a night out.we had head great things about the food here at MGM park but unfortunately wasn’t a option for us
40,Love the hotel our second time there. The pool is great and not over packed. The staff was amazing. No fridge in room or locks on the door but with that we are planning our next trip to the park. A hidden gem
40,Staffs are great. Location is decent. Room is ok but we expected something bigger for the price we paid. Elevators are good and set up is pretty decent to avoid crowd. Table games are a little pricy but managable.
50,Clean fresh rooms and the entire resort smelled fresh. Loved Eataly and the location. Room was ready early and had a tram to save steps to Aria Bellagio and Crystal Shops. Loved everything about it.
50,The rooms are able to be very dark when the blinds are closed -- great for sleeping. Mini fridge must be rented to have one in the room. One snafu with our group check-in but it was resolved the next day.
50,Was pleasantly surprised that there was a smoke-free hotel in Vegas with first-rate food available inside. Room was completely clean and I slept very well. Made use of the fitness center which was much better than other hotels that I've stayed at.
40,The Park is a really nice place solid in all respects great cocktails at Juniper good rooms easy sleep (though I think they limit the AC levels) good bathroom with fast hot water clean and friendly. Not luxury but solid mid market property and performance for sure.
50,I have been staying with MGM resorts in Vegas as an Mlife member for about 10 years now. Given my casino play (which is not over the top) I can usually get good prices to full comp for my room. That said The Park has a really good location great food choices (notably Eataly) and the staff I encountered were consistently friendly.    The pool area is not quite as large and lavish as a property like the Bellagio but it is still a big upgrade from when it was the Monte Carlo (pre reno). The pool area could use a little more shade - suggestion to management.    The rooms have all the standard stuff and the King room I was in had a nice built in bench sofa that could accommodate a few folks if you decided to hang out in your room for a bit. People often say your never in your room in Vegas but having a little downtime there is not a bad call.    I play a lot of craps and the crews working the tables were consistently friendly. My play tends to be enough to earn me free or deeply discounted rooms.
40,I love that this is a smoke free hotel/casino. They have really good restaurants so you don't have to leave which is nice in the summer when it's too hot to go out! The beds weren't as comfortable as other hotel beds but they weren't bad.
30,Great location on the strip but the rooms were outdated and I promise I had the worst view on the strip. It was almost comical. Other than that it was fine. However when I needed to extend my trip due to a cancelled flight they said there were no rooms available with 2 beds. When I checked online I brought it to their attention that there were some just too confirm they were still available and they said “then book it online” instead of answering the question I asked. It was surprisingly rude.  Other than that things were mediocre for Vegas
40,Nice hotel but expensive carpet in room was deceiving good location and good Italian restaurants enjoyed no smoking casino and tram to and from Bellagio Hotel. Self check is ok would recommend but cheaper price.
40,Wonderful experience in the Park Theater great sound and lighting. We really enjoyed the smoke free casino and public areas. The restaurants were outstanding especially Best Friend. The room was spartan and outdated with plumbing issues.
50,We enjoy the smoke free environment Friendly service and the ability to walk to most of all the locations Vegas has to offer; this is the 2nd time I’ve stayed at Park MGM and it doesn’t disappoint; I currently have one future trip booked and scheduling our next guys trip for April 2023!
30,Check in was easy and staff nice. Room was small and basic with outdated furniture no fridge. Coach was dirty and had crumbs and people’s belongings under the cushions. Bed was comfortable. Too expensive for the basic and outdated rooms.
50,Love the hotel location and service. The staff was great. Room service food could of been better but it was still good for the price. Forgot the agent name who checked us in but he was kind and provided luxury service. I will be returning.
50,Very peaceful and great. Will be staying here again. The staff was great as well as the hotel itself. Pool was great as well as all the dining options. I was staying there for a concert and would stay again
30,Staff very friendly and attentive. Hotel casino área always clean with exception of my room when I checked in the towels had lipstick and the cleaning personnel forgot to clean my room the next day I went for breakfast around 9:15 and came back to room at 3pm and room was not done☹️
50,I have been going to Vegas for 25 years now. Park MGM is the old Monte Carlo they re-did. It is a nice property but the main selling point is the non-smoking environment even in the casino. It is fantastic. Rooms are smaller because it is an older property but well maintained. I would suggest every non-smoker stay here. I will not stay anywhere else again until others are non-smoking.
50,I stayed 4 days at the Park MGM and my experience was amazing. All of the staff are highly respectful and courteous. The casino was nice and it’s especially good because it’s a non smoking facility. The pool’s they were clean and helped to keep you cool during the hot days. If you like a good old fashion try the pool bar Arturo makes one heck of a drink
30,The rooms are not setup for businessmen who don’t want to go out to eat every night. All I want is a clean and comfortable room with proper living amenities. In my opinion this hotel didn’t provide that.
40,Great location on the strip. Nothing fancy but great value to have some fun in Vegas. Right next to the golden knights arena if you plan on going to a game. Overall great experience. MGM rewards never disappoints!
20,Checked into ParkMGM. Check-in was quick. Room was not clean. Carpet was hard to tell original color with so many stains. Looks like they only dusted have a wall as you could write your name in hte dust. They gave me a room in the Nomad (for an additional $79+ a night) and that room was better but no maid service one day. Not typical MGM property standard.
50,Love the location on the strip. Tram is a nice bonus feature as it saves on walking to the Bellagio. Staff are very friendly. Room was a  Nighthawke Suite. Bed was comfortable and room was very clean. Close to elevators and very spacious.
50,This place is simply the best!  From checking in the staff rooms casino and location. Can never go wrong when choosing to stay here. This place is right in the center of all attractions!! Can’t wait to come back!!!
10,Non existent sound proofing at connecting doors. Could quite literally hear people yawning in the adjacent room. Now imagine you’re in vegas with rowdy drunk neighbors. You expect to hear people laughing and having fun outside your door as they pass but not at full volume permanently in the next room from 10pm-6am. Left early to palazzo after 1/2 nights. They probably couldn’t pay you enough to stay here besides the great easy access to the Dolby live arena which we used to see the Jonas Brothers. Stay elsewhere even if you are here for Dolby live. Pay the extra 1-200 per night.
50,The woman that helped me at the front desk was absolutely amazing! Staff is friendly and the hotel and casino are clean and smoke free! My only issue is there was no fridge inside the room. Other than that is was great!
50,The room was spacious and clean. The app was user friendly and very convenient for check in. We enjoyed sitting on the couch and drinking coffe while enjoying the view. The shower towels were large and soft. The bathroom amenities were pleasant. Love this hotel
50,Great location with the free tram to Bellagio lots of options for food near by and in the Casino and smoke free! Great pool to hang out at as well. We loved the rooms and the service everywhere was awesome!
40,Security staff Chase Zwahalen did due dillengence when releasing my lost item since it had been found in another guests room. So thankful lost jewelry was returned! Chase acknowledged the inconvenient delay in returning item which was above and beyond good customer service.
10,Don’t stay here it sucks. Walls are thin you can here everything you neighbors do. Not a good thing in Vegas where people never sleep. We arrived at 1 am so we could get o. A flight at 7 am. Got to our room music from room on one side was loud until after 3am. Then the room on the other side were having a yelling fight at 3 am. Walls are paper thin don’t stay unless you like noise from the rooms around you
50,Great time was had by all 8 of us! Felt safe. Smoke free. Super clean. Comfortable rooms. Delicious restaurants. Couldn’t have been any better! Will definitely be going back. Hopefully for next year’s girls trip.
30,Gets the job done at a budget friendly price. Beds are not the best and sleep very warm thermostat had to be set to 62 to keep room cool. The digital key remote check in and shortest walk ever (for Vegas) from entry to elevators are big pluses.
50,Absolutely love the non smoking policy throughout the casino ! Since it’s the only hotel that is non smoking I won’t be staying anywhere else ! All the hotels should have this policy ! All the restaurants had fantastic food too !
50,I played blackjack at the Park MGM for 7 hours yesterday.    Corina is a blackjack dealer in the table games department. She is one of the best BJ dealers I've come across. She is incredibly helpful patient and fun! She makes playing at Park MGM better than at other casinos.    I also really appreciate your 2 $25 blackjack tables that pay 3:2 for blackjacks. $25 3:2 tables are really hard to find in Vegas!    I've recommended the Park MGM to several friends because of Corina and your 3:2 tables.    I look forward to my next trip to the Park MGM.    Derald Lyons
30,The place can be happier and brighter - rooms are dark - corridors leading to rooms are dark - wall paint is dark .  The brighter the place the happier it is .  For a Vegas hotel it can be cleaner and more modern .
50,This is my 3rd time hoteling with Park MGM. The pools are fantastic staff take pride in ensuring the area of the hotel and casino is near and organized. It is wonderful staying in a smoke free building. This attribute allowed me to enjoy the casino restaurant and common areas of the hotel.
50,in the past 4 months i have stayed in 3 different rooms. All modern and clean if there was any issues they were corrected quickly. As a smoker I enjoyed the smoke free enviorment If I wanted to smoke nyny is about a 3 minute walk outside. Only downside was getting a drink in the casino. It took forever to flag down a server. Once she knew i was there then I would get frequent visits but the first drink was always a challenge.
30,The beds were very uncomfortable. The mattresses were low to the floor and worn. There was no refrigerator or microwave in room. The pillows were so soft your head sank into them. Didn't like the way the closet door and bathroom door was one in the same. Needless to say they need to invest in new mattresses and pillows. I can say the pool was nice clean and plenty of chairs.
30,Fairly good location easy check-in. Elevators were always fast. Got upgraded to the special health-focused room but I still have no idea what made it special. HATED having the same door for both the closet and bathroom. Really missed having a fridge. Maid service was excellent. Pool area was a little obnoxious but I am not into the Las Vegas pool scenes. Fitness room is TINY and crowded. The spa was pretty mediocre and I am now dealing with a charge to my credit card that is incorrect from my service. For the cost I would stay elsewhere in the future.
50,We have been to Vegas multiple times and although we love to gamble we n the casinos the smoke gets to be unbearable at times with park mgm that problem is gone. We absolutely loved not having to smell cigarettes cigars or ashtrays everywhere we went. Definitely will be returning and recommending to friends.
40,I had a great stay at the Park MGM. Everything went very smoothly I highly recommend getting the Park MGM app on your phone. Fun casino good location nice pool great conference facilities. Eataly is a lot of fun and has great food and drinks. It's also easy to charge things to your room which is very convenient!
50,Great service clean rooms and friendly staff. All staff were very helpful and housekeeping was on top of their game. The non smoking casino provided a great family experience. Easy access to the strip and the tram was a great addition to access the north side of the strip with out walking out into the heat
50,Walking down the Las Vegas Strip my wife and I took a break from the heat and walked in the Eataly area. I discovered one of the best Happy Hour deals on wine in Vegas. Security guard Hank Graae hooked us up! La Bottega Del Vino is a great spot to relax and grab a glass. Hank also gave us a $50 in food discounts for the food court. Thanks Hank!
50,The Park MGM is a nice place to stay and is center strip with easy access to the Aria Express Tram. The front desk were so helpful when I was having trouble with mobile checkin. Great Italian restaurants.
50,First time staying at this MGM resort but will not be our last. We stayed most of the days in the many pools available and had plenty of drinks and food from our excellent Poolside Waitress Alex. With the Temperatures exceeding 100 every day the pool was the place to be.  The food selection at night was just as good. So many small restaurants to choose from. And the Italian Ice Cream was fantastic.
50,no smoking adds to reason to stay at Park Outdoor dining (breakfast) at Primrose or food from Eataly and Asian restaurant all fine. Staff helpful and pleasant. tram access a plus. Art throughout our rooms and in lounge at Nomad great.
40,We loved the fact that the entire hotel and casino was non smoking. We had a great time and used our smart phone to check in via the app and also used it for our room key. You could go to a kiosk and get a physical key card but we did not bother. We did not speak to a person the whole 3 day visit. We absolutely loved the Eataly section - we had breakfast there most days and there was plenty of choice. A great Italian restaurant in there too. Easy access to the free train that runs behind the Strip to move about up to Bellagio. We were able to charge most things to our room - MGM seems to own most of the hotels in Vegas nowadays.
50,Great room at very nice hotel thoroughly enjoyed my stay there. Staff was all great and took care of all my needs. Although it was a short stay this time definitely will be back again sometime soon. Can’t wait to return!
40,Would have given this resort more stars but the only thing that was very disappointing was the beds and pillows. From a company like MGM I would have expected more. They definitely need to invest in new mattresses as well as pillows. Also not comfortable to sit on unless you are 5 feet and below
50,The staff were extremely friendly and helpful. The hotel was clean and the room beautiful. Would highly recommend eating at Eatly the food and service was great with many options to choose from. The beverage service on the floor was great never had to wait long for a drink while playing at a machine.
50,Great location on the strip and smoke free. We like the casino layout and there are several nice pools. We love to stay here. Rooms are simple but the beds are comfy and the water pressure is good.
50,great accommodations and close to all the action. I enjoyed the food court selections eat there three days in a row. I highly recommend The Library the food there was excellent. The hotel itself is none smoking so for a nonsmokers it was great and can recommend it for any one wanting to come to Vegas.
50,As much as I travel to Vegas I didn’t realize a smoke-free casino was an option. Loved the smell of fresh air throughout the property & casino. Great food options (love Eataly) cool bars. Right on the strip. Would definitely stay here again.
50,I had an awesome time with my sister and God daughter and her mother. I didn’t win any money but the weather was great. The variety of restaurants was awesome as well. But the icing on the cake was the complimentary tickets to see Bruno Mars and Silk Sonic that was The BESTTTT concert every right next to New Edition. Praying I get complimentary tickets for Usher but I guess we’ll wait and see….
50,Awesome trip with family. Checked in with app all comps were as promised. Ate at Eataly everyday. Pool was clean and drink service super quick. I will be back…love that it is non-smoking! Large number of latest slots.
50,Park mgm resort location isn’t that bad. The free tram was helpful on days we were tired of walking although the walk to the tram was also long. It was also great since we watched silk sonic and had a blast.
40,We love that the property is smoke free. The first evening there was a strong cleanser smell in the room. That slowly dissipated or we got used to it. The hallways were very dark. There was no bathtub.    Otherwise we loved our stay.
50,The no smoking atmosphere made any nominal issues meaningless I'll look for other hotels in Las Vegas that are smoke free or continue to stay at the MGM. Great location. Went to the Silk Sonicshow. Make sure to look for the best deal on tickets. I overpaid but that's on me. Sick Sonic was still worth it. I also broked the room a couple months out but found prices were much lower two or three days before our stay. The hotel accommodated the lower price. Good on them. They were not able to accommodate the early check and late check of the original reservation. Had to upgrade to a lager room to get an early check-in. They let us check-in 7am. The room was actually to big for just my wife and me but it was worth the early check-in. Food on-site was a little pricey but just a little. More food choices across the street. Easily walkable less than five minutes from the hotel. Even in the heat. CVS was less than a five minute walk as well.
50,Always love staying here. Some staff were not the nicest this stay at the bell desk. I love that this hotel is smoke free and the rooms are nice. I only wish they had fridges in the rooms. Will stay here again!
50,Good convenient location. Close to the action and the Bruno Mars show was in the building. You can walk to most areas or take the free tram to bellagios. Also there’s free parking if you are a pearl member.
10,If you plan on just dropping off your items at the room and never actually spending time in the room..... then this is the spot for you. If you actually plan on staying in it. Well; I suggest you bring your own pillows mattress blankets rug cleaning items as well.
50,First time My 5 sisters and I traveled together had a good time going back in November planning to stay at Park MGM since it is non-smoking love that I can breathe clean air not have to worry about the burning in my eyes
50,This member rewards program is outstanding. Front desk was super helpful they made everything easy to understand were super friendly. Great quality for free stay. Would definitely recommend being a ember rewards program to all of my friends
50,I was impressed by the front desk staff and their extra effort made to ensure my stay was enjoyable. I liked that the pool complex was so close to the room elevators. Food options were also close to the room elevators. Overall my best Vegas stay to date!
50,Good place to stay. Room is very clean staffs are kind and helpful.The bed is soft linen are clean. Although I dont have pet this place is a pet friendly  you can take your fido with you.This place is highly recommend.
10,If you are an American Express Gold Platinum or other travel related perks cardholder do not use this hotel. At check in they confirmed credits and then at checkout would not honor although I had the documentation they provided themselves at check-in. It was a very disappointing experience for what is usually a great one with Amex Hotel  Collection locations/resorts.
20,The hotel located on the strip needs a refresh.  I stayed during October 2021 arrived at 10PM - queue at the check in because only 1 employee.  The room gave me the feeling to be scrappy - smelling bad and not very clean -  it was late so I stayed 1 night and left for another hotel the next morning
50,The new additions to the property are fabulous! This hotel has lots of charm. Short walk to the connection for Aria if you love Poker. Tram to Bellagio if you want to save some energy and beat the heat. Would definitely stay here again. The remodeled room was nice. Great view of the mountains and both arena's.
40,We were very happy with our stay. My only complaint would be the WiFi not always working. The staff was very friendly our room clean and plenty of water pressure in the shower. The wait staff was all very friendly.
50,We enjoyed having a smoke free environment to return to wake up in every morning and return to every night. If we didn't have plans we played in the Park's casino just because we could breathe without getting scratchy throats. Eataly is a GREAT addition to this property and was probably our favorite place to eat on the trip.
40,this is a older hotel on the strip that meets the middle ground accommodations in comparison to the MGM Signature. I changed to this location due to not wanting to make the long walk to the strip as you do with the signature. (CX) bus line is only 5 minute walk to front desk so even coming/going to airport is just a few steps away if you want to save a few dollars. Hotel is none smoking which is great you can sit and enjoy a smoke free atmosphere for those who don't smoke. Rooms are not to small and met all our needs. Bed was great shades worked to keep light out for those who sleep in room was clean. Decor not really anything to brag about. Pictures are not much more than you would find in most box stores. Carpet is due for replacement anytime. If you had a loud neighbor it would definitely be heard threw walls but that was never an issue with my stay. If your into gambling on a budget the minimum bets are not friendly here. They start at $15 and go up from there. So I spent it on entertainment and dining at other locations. Kinda a shame as I would have preferred to stay local to spend my money. So not really much down side more of preferences.
50,Stayed here on my most recent trip to Vegas and was not disappointed. Check in online and the room was ready by 12! Rooms were cleaning and comfortable. This is a non smoking resort and being a smoker I still appreciated that! It’s right across the road from the T-Mobile arena. The location to everything is awesome. Definitely staying here again!
40,Overall I thought the room was descent. The pillows were to hard and big. It was nice that they have 4 pillows per bed. The mattress was a little to firm as well. Only problem in our room was a little bit of mold in the shower. Staff was very nice. The casino was fun.
50,Stayed for a date night. Self parking was a breeze. Our room was very nice and bed was comfy.  We ate on site. Lovely remodel. Would recommend if you have an event a T-Mobile arena to attend. The staff was friendly
50,I tend to stay here when I attend a concert at the Dolby Live or T-Mobile venues. Staff at the hotel are friendly and helpful. The options for food and coffee is great. And have access to tram to head to other nearby hotels.
50,The Park MGM is a wonderful hotel with amazing food and amenities. From On the Record club to just your relaxed casual dining it was a very fun experience! Our room was absolutely beautiful. Very large spacious suit! This hotel is a non-smoking casino. This made this day even more relaxing and enjoyable.
30,Pretty disappointed there was no fridge. With the high heat in Vegas I can’t believe there was no fridge to keep my water and drinks cold. Also it sucks that you can’t bring your own drink to the pool area. Only what they sell to you there.
50,I really liked the hotel. Staff was friendly and it was really close to the strip. Check in and out was easy (especially through the app). Only problem was the TV would glitch when we bought a movie. But other then that I would recommend
40,Stayed at the Park MGM on a 2-day weekend visit to Vegas. In general the hotel is a really nice property for the money. Well-located nicely appointed quality room friendly staff and super well designed mobile app (check-in parking etc.).    Wer were somewhat disappointed to find no minibar fridge in room more majorly frustrated that we were not allowed to access the MGM Grand (sister property where some friends were staying) pool. My understanding from the MGM website was that staying at one MGM property allowed you to access amenities at the others.    Overall I'd recommend this hotel for both leisure and business travel.
40,My stay went well. Other than finding a few issues with the room I had no other complaints. The bell service was great. People were friendly. The check-in/our process was extremely efficient. I would recommend this hotel just make sure you check the rooms fully.
10,We could hear the normal conversations from the rooms on both sides of us. The walls are so thin. It was terrible. We mentioned it to the staff and she just said “wow I’ve never heard that complaint before” I have a feeling that’s not true. The bed was awful. I just couldn’t find anything good about this resort. I hate it because I’ve always wanted to stay here.
50,We had a great time. The Park never disappoints in terms of relaxed and fun atmosphere. The gaming was not as good as we usually find it . The staff was friendly and helpful especially on our check in.
50,The Park MGM has been my best experience in Vegas out of nearly a dozen trips. The staff was fantastic and the Smoke-free atmosphere made all the difference. It's also in a very convenient location and not built like a frustrating maze like so many other properties. Will certainly be back!
50,Great experience 👍 highly recommend this resort . I have stayed at Paris hotel. New York New York and ballys hotel . By far the park mgm has been the best stay. I will be trying other mgm resorts as the aria will be next on my list.
50,Great restaurants! Especially Eataly and the steakhouse. Terrific selection of slot machines. Always servers available for beverages when playing and quick service. Nice location on the Las Vegas strip.
40,I generally enjoyed my stay at the Park MGM. The property is set back a bit from the strip with its Eatly area on the strip. Being a smoke free property was a literal breath of fresh air. The king size basic room was nice but it is a basic room. The banquette and large leather chair is a nice touch.
50,`If you are planning on going to a show at the Dolby Theater or the T-Mobile arena this is the place to stay. Not too crowded except for the pools. The resort is clean and near great places that you can visit with the tram that joins the Crystal Shops the Aria and the Bellagio. The Park MGM is also near Eataly a place where you can have just about anything Italian to eat. Great place all together.
40,friendly staff clean room easy check-in/check-out with the app. was surprised to not have a mini-fridge. when we asked about it we were told it is $35/day to RENT one...on top of an already expensive stay....
50,Convenient location on the strip friendly staff great food & smoke free! We would definitely stay here again. Casino was clean and fun restaurant at the NoMad was excellent pools are nice and have a free area (which is becoming rare at resorts in Vegas)- definitely a winner for the value.
50,If you are above 40 and want a more quiet and relaxing experience that the MGM Grand this is the place to go. You get all of the MGM Rewards points and close access to MGM Grand restaurants and events but less chaos. It was so nice to be able to check into a MGM property without a long line and then go to your hotel room without having to navigate the casino. Plus Park MGM formerly Monte Carlo underwent a tremendous facelift a few years ago and the property look wonderful.
20,Room looked beautiful but the sheets were stained and were not fitted so our sheets kept moving all over the place while trying to get comfortable. The outlets in the room were very convenient. Also wished we had more towels in the room!
50,We had another great visit at Park MGM. I love everything about this casino/hotel. The staff was very helpful and friendly. The casino floor was clean and played great music. The restaurants were really good!
40,Great that it was on smoking. Eatly was overrated but overall great food. The rooms were tidy . The machines didn’t pay out as much as you’d think. Honestly it was a great hotel to stay in but they didn’t comp resort fees even though we spent a lot of money at the casino gambling etc
40,The reasons I choose Park MGM was the it's non-smoking and the location is perfect. The tram took us center strip. Staff was friendly and helpful. Enjoyed my stay. Looking forward to next girls trips.
50,Great location and staff. Some of the best dining options on the strip. The pools are really nice and probably some of the nicest at any of the MGM properties in Vegas. The rooms are pretty small and minimalist for the price and upscale vibe.
50,I really loved the smoke free hotel at Las Vegas. My family really enjoyed smoke free transit around the casino area. The location is very convenient to move around Las Vegas Blvd. (South/North). Nice restaurants around the hotel.
30,Casino Bar/drink service was nonexistent good luck ordering a drink while gambling. Resort fees were and overnight parking fees were expensive. Only plus is the Park MGM is a non-smoking casino. Not impressed !
50,We very much enjoyed our stay mainly because it smoke free the staff was very kind and courteous. The restaurant named Side Betty was a lovely place to eat and drink coffee. All in all it was a great stay
10,Came out for my bachelorette party and when I got to my room the place wasn’t cleaned at all! The beds weren’t made and there was trash everywhere! I knew it was too good to be true when I got a notification that my room was ready so fast
50,Great location on the strip. Non-smoking casino is nice and clean. Eataly is a must try. Everything was so fresh! Pool had an adults only section which is nice since more and more people are bringing kids to Vegas.
50,Have heard people complain about thin walls/noise and lack of dresser/counter space. Our suite had none of these issues and was a great room to spend our 4 nights in Vegas. Housekeeping provided everything we could need beds were comfortable and it was so quiet at night. We rarely heard our neighbors throughout our stay. And to top it off every staff member we came across was incredibly friendly and helpful!    We can’t wait to come back next time we’re in town!
50,Great location middle of the strip very clean and modern rooms with excellent staff and housekeeping as far as the casino they have a mix of the new games and also a few classic games. I would definitely stay here again!
50,Concert trip with a friend who canceled our n me last minute leaving me with a huge credit card bill and non transferable tickets from SF to LV. Victor made me at least survive the day!! I would have cried the whole trip if not for him!!
50,I’ve Always loved the layout of the Monte Carlo and the new remodeling & rebranding of the now Park MGM. The best part of this Casino & Resort to me is the fact that it is a Non-smoking property which is Awesome. Great restaurants and perfect location. We will always stay at Park MGM!!!
50,Thoroughly enjoyed our stay over the Memorial Day weekend at Park MGM. Highly recommend eating at the Primrose within the hotel. Had back to back breakfasts there. Casino was clean drinks were great and staff was awesome! Have stayed at a few hotels along the strip but this was our favorite.
50,Park MGM was great! would stay again. Everything was clean and tidy the check in process was smooth because of the digital key we didn't have to go to the front desk. I would recommend this hotel to my friends!
30,For a hotel that is on the strip this is really a bargain basement property. The rooms are stentorian in there decor. The showers are minimally outfitted. The towels are substandard. The bed is oddly situated with the television though there was a projectable mount that has the TV able to change its aspect. The mattresses are uncomfortable. The view is horrible from the average room.    The rooms are not well insulated and anyone making any conversational or jubilant noise in the hallways (likely every night) is a regular feature. You can hear just about every noise in the room next-door to you.    On the positive side the hotel houses the large and impressive food court called Eataly. It’s impressive. The hotel staff were accommodating in having a refrigerator brought to our room. That is both a plus and minus if you can imagine what one would expect from the Las Vegas strip hotels’ amenities.    The only thing giving this property a third star is the food court.
40,Front desk Valet and Bell service provided great customer service. I like that it is a smoke free hotel. The rooms were just ok just a place to lay your head. Casino was nice check was horrible. They overcharged us due to checking out early for an emergency. But besides that experience it was ok.
10,Room has no refrigerator unless requested plus a $35.00 up charge.    Even if you stayed in the resort you still need to pay a $15.00 per day charge for parking    Customer service was really rude and compared Nevada to California when I complained why I needed to pay for parking when I was checked into your hotel for four nights?
30,The rooms need to have the dust clean around the beds. Also the floors needs to be vacuumed as there is a collection of desk all around the bed frames.    The location price and location is decent for the stay as you can take the tram all the way to Bellagio.
50,Excellent place to stay. The smoke free environment is amazing. Friendly staff fun place to play with plenty of complimentary drinks. No need to go anywhere else since they have a great variety of restaurant to choose from.
30,We paid goooood money for the Park MGM and then we’re told it was an extra $40 a day to have a freaking mini fridge brought to our room! Are you kidding me?! A freaking fridge?! Isn’t that like a standard? That’s like paying for sheets on your bed!
40,Love the location. Resort smelled so nice. Loved the pool area. At a time when so many people are complaining about resorts and rooms being outdated and need of a refreshing it was nice to see how well they have kept up this property.
50,If you want a clean room & night stay with a reasonable price while in Vegas and you want to be somewhat in the center of strip and you want Non-Smoking casino...you'll love it!! Also great authentic Italian food to die for...taste buds explode...pre-warning eh? LOL  Lastly you have Target and plenty of stores for your needs close to this property for great convenience.
50,So wonderful to have a hotel and casino in Vegas that is smoke free. No more scratchy throat and cough from breathing in all the second hand smoke which has been a given in Vegas. Nice to have the option. Staff are welcoming.
50,We were just in for one night for an show. The room was great clean and comfortable. The check in and out was very easy on their app. Using the app to get in and out of the parking garage was much faster than the people not using the app. This was our first time staying ar the MGM Park. Hopefully we do it again sometime and have more time to see around the hotel and casino.
50,"I love the no smoking throughout the casino and hotel. It was kept clean in the casino andll hotel. The only turn off was one of the shops in the casino where I went to buy a diet mountain dew. No prices until you check out and it was like $6.80...when I commented to the older gentlemen that I could probably get 6 of them back home for that cost his response was ""Remember where you are!"". That resonated with me throughout my trip."
50,Park MGM is for me the best hotel on the strip. Great location among many other MGM properties with many dining choices. The staff is very pleasant and helpful. Very clean and best of all smoke free.
40,Nice smoke free resort on the strip. This was our second time staying here. We love the location on the strip. Employees are nice and helpful. We wish the slots paid a lot better but overall it is a nice place to stay.
50,Never been to Las Vegas before. The Park MGM was amazing. The casino was clean and did not smell like smoke like some of the other casino’s we visited. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The restaurants were top notch. The only drawback is that I wish the rooms would of had a small refrigerator. I will be back.
50,This Hotel the Park MGM Las Vegas is the best hotel by far! Immediately upon entry you are greeted with the smell of clean smoke free environment. NO overpowering smells of cigars cigarettes or any exotic type of rolled vices people tend to do in a casino. I was so pleased that my clothes remained odor free during my stay. The service is amazing and so friendly. More so during the night shift. I really do recommend this hotel for anyone who wants to be in a clean free environment. Gambling never felt so good!!!! Thank you Park MGM.
50,Going to Vegas was a birthday (66th!) and bucket list wish. I am so glad we picked Park MGM. Our suite was very roomy and comfortable; staff extremely helpful and friendly. The hotel casino and pool area are very clean. The resort is close to the monorail which makes it easy to move between casinos. And so many incredible restaurants in and around the resort.
50,Great hotel…great staff..great city! Weather was beautiful so spent a lot of time chillin by the pool. Las Vegas never disappoints….always a fun time. Always so much to do…fun filled excursions. Can’t wait to go back!
40,Nice rooms great price except slot machines don't pay hardy ever and getting service on the floor took forever. The walk to the strip was long. But the room was excellent. I would definitely stay there again.
40,Great hotel. Check in was quick and easy. And rooms are very safe making sure that keys are needed for the elevators and rooms. Casino was very clean without the smokiness of the others. Sinks could have better drainage. But bathrooms were very clean and big.
50,total enjoy our stay casino and hotel was great food great room service outstanding hope to visit soon again like key to use elevator felt more safe downstairs casino was lots of fun and love games came home with $800.00 it was so much fun and it was a non SMOKING hotel and casino
50,We always return to the Park MGM to stay. The only hotel/casino that is non smoking and what a positive difference that is. Wonderful and friendly staff with nice restaurants pools venues security Easy access parking and close to so many other top hotels casinos and the airport. Great choice for a Vegas stay.
50,This hotel has great ambience is a smoke-free facility and has modern rooms. The smoke-free facility was key!! We also had a room with an awesome view. Convenient restaurants and access to the monorail. Perfect place to stay!
50,I liked the hotel the service it was fenomenal. It was very clean and sanitize .people very friendly . I will stay in this hotel next time also I will recomend to my family and friends . It was non smoking hotel 👍👍👍
50,The check in/checkout process was seamless rooms were clean pool was awesome food was amazing and the staff was friendly and helpful. We love that this is a non-smoking hotel. The Silk Sonic show was AMAZING!!! We'll be back!!
50,Friendly and efficient staff! Very helpful ! Beautiful suite with wonderful view! It was our first time at the MGM Park and we certainly will stay there next year! We loved that it is a non smoking hotel! Super location!
50,Smoke free so clean front desk was kind house keeping clean only problem is gaming table is not kind and they looks angry that part was uncomfortable meals was good most of people's are sweet except casino peoples so I play other casino that was not good
50,The room was very comfortable and quiet and the hotel had more than adequate amenities. The Dolby Theater is an incredible venue with all great seats and the check in staff was very engaging and friendly. I would definitely plan to stay there again!
40,Reception area was fast. Got to my room in 10 minutes. Great location for this hotel. New York  New York is basically right across the street. A walkway connects to Aria and a tram connects to Bellagio.
50,The Park MGM was a really awesome place to stay at. Staff was super friendly and helpful. Location of the strip was really quick. Took 2 minutes to be on the strip. And it felt very cozy and clean to sleep.
50,Very easy to check in with the pp I never had to go to the front desk. It was very smooth and trouble free I noticed that the staff was very positive in their dealings with the clients and it helped to shape my feelongs about the Park MGM
50,I absolutely enjoyed my stay at the MGM Park and would definitely stay again. Love the fact the hotel is smoke free. Attended Silk Sonic concert which was great and it located inside hotel at Dolby Live.
50,Great hotel. Clean all around - Room Casino Restaurants Lounges public restrooms pool and shops. The non-smoking casino is absolutely AMAZING!  Having Eataly as a dining adult beverage coffee option attached is VERY nice. Primrose serves a delicious breakfast as well.
20,We always go to Vegas for our anniversary. Our room was dirty sink shower bed blanket and sheets. Good area walking distance to restaurants was short. Overall the room was dirty but the area was great!
50,We had the best time in Las Vegas especially staying at the Park MGM! Almost all the casino's had great air quality but staying in the only smoke-free hotel/casino on the Strip was awesome! Room was great comfy bed amazing huge shower! Everyone was so nice and friendly! We will absolutely be staying there on our next trip!
50,Great MGM resort that is non-smoking and beautiful! Great pool with a more low key vibe compared to some other resorts which was exactly what I was looking for. No fridge in the rooms but you can get one for $35/day which is a little crazy to me considering most standard rooms provide a refrigerator
40,The hotel is fine. However I missed some of the conveniences I’m used to like a coffee pot microwave and a mini fridge. Housekeeping only came for two of our four day stay so we didn’t get fresh glassware or a liner for the ice bucket. If price matters - this is a hotel we’d stay at again.
50,Smoke free!! Love the fresh clean air. Loved the pool rented two lounge chairs and got a bucket with iced water delivered by one of the pool attendants you can also order food and drinks from your phone and they will bring it right to you. you can easily spend the whole day there. In the middle of all the action! Front desk staff super friendly. Phenomenal value!!! Will be returning soon.
30,Room was small and was found a little dirty and the shower head was coming off the wall in shower. The location of the casino is great on the strip and the ac in the room was great. There isn’t a lot of food options after 9pm so that’s a bummer
50,Was there for the Bruno Mars and Anderson Pac concert inside the hotel. The room was nice and clean. The pool was very nice and relaxing. The only negative for me was that it is sort of on the south end of the strip. I just usually prefer to be mid strip but that's just me! Definitely would stay again!
50,I really love that this place is smoke-free!!    The front desk personnel was super friendly professional and personable! We especially enjoyed our interaction with Jennea!! She went above and beyond to welcome us and make us feel comfortable upon check in. We couldn’t get a Fresh Stay-Well room but she helped us get our preference for a high floor away from the elevator. I’d come back here again because of friendly interactions like that.
40,Most of the hotel/casinos in las Vegas are filled with smoke. We chose the Park MGM because its a rare smoke-free casino resort. The food at Eately tastes so much better without the second hand smoke.  The rooms were recently decorated with a swanky velvet couch in front of the window overlooking the strip. Overall a great experience.
50,The Bruno and Anderson Show at Park M GM was flawless. Absolutely awesome show. I would pay to see them again. The restaurants were easy to get in for dinner and the food was really good. Starbucks line was always long but moves very quickly.
40,"This hotel was surprisingly reasonable very clean kind of out of date in ways but excellent service and we slept so good! Be careful of the parking its $26 per day for valet and $14 for self-parking. Which is expensive in my eyes. It makes me feel kind of funny not to top the valet guys because the parking is expensive. Our check in and check out was great! We ordered breakfast and we were surprised at how good it was. Also if you are going with other people try to get room on the same floor because your key card will only allow you to go to your floor and that's it. So we did a lot of ""meet me in the lobby"" in order to go up to my Mom and sisters rooms."
50,Nice hotel they let me check in an hour before checkin time. Right in the middle of everything. The Dolby theater is in the hotel so convenient. Pool area is nice looked clean with water and food service.
50,I went to Las Vegas for the Silk Sonic show at teh Dolby Park MGM. I stayed at the Park MGM which was a great choice. I loved the King room and the convenience of the location on the strip. The fact that the show was at the same place was awesome. The Park MGM is an amazing place. I would stay there again.
20,We made use of mobile check in and didn’t have much interaction with the staff due to lack of servers on the floor.The room was not cleaned properly for our arrival. Dusty night stand and tablestrands of hair in the beds and dirty qtips left on the entertainment ledge next to the mini bar/snack tray. Also the A/C did not work properly. Temperature readings were incorrect. It was hot in there. 17-104 The in room dining was a plus although the food had been sitting long enough to be luke warm at best.
30,We had stayed here previously 6 years ago loved the location and chose to stay here again for this trip. While we appreciate the fact that the rooms have been renovated we found that there is now a severe lack of storage space. There is no dresser so unless you want to use your suitcase as a dresser everything needs to be stored in the closet. That’s a problem when the closet is so small and the setup inside is not conducive to hanging much of anything or even putting much on the shelves. As we were in Vegas to get married we had event appropriate attire with us. The rod in the closet might be 8” long at best and has a shelf below it at a height that makes it impossible to hang a full-length dress. We ended up hanging multiple items from each of the 6 hangers provided. My dress had to be puddled onto the shelf below the rod essentially making that shelf unusable. The bulk of our clothes were housed in our suitcases or set on the couch for our entire stay.  The bathroom could also use storage of some sort. Clean towels are left on the counter next to the sink leaving no room for any toiletries you have brought with you.  The configuration of the actual room is lacking thought. The TV is set (in our room) on the wall to the right of the bed which makes watching TV from the bed awkward and uncomfortable. There is a couch below the window which would have been good if we didn’t need it as a place to set our clothing. In addition to the couch there is a table and 1 chair. An additional chair would be nice. Under the TV there is NOTHING! There is plenty of room there for a dresser.  Our room was located at the end of the hall and away from the elevators which we were happy with as we thought this would keep noise to a minimum. But the walls are paper thin and not only could we hear the people in the room next to us partying into the wee hours we could also hear music booming from a venue below us until about 2am.  Again we love the location and enjoyed EATALY. We grabbed a sandwich there before getting ready for our wedding. While it was tasty we thought the price of $22 each was a little high.  Ultimately we will probably choose another hotel for our next visit to Vegas as this is no longer our go to hotel.
40,We had our end of the work season celebration in Vegas. Boss picked this hotel because it is not smoke and that was great idea. You can tell when you walk in to others hotels lobbies the big difference. We had a good time at the Park MGM
40,First time staying at Park MGM. Clean rooms great location and accommodating to my kids who just turned 21. They didn’t win big but I also didn’t have to worry about them being too far away. Drinks at the pool were pretty expensive.
20,I had an air blower outside of my room at night blowing while I’m trying to sleep. As soon as I checked in I noticed it outside of my door off. Then they decided to turn it on at night while people are sleeping. Also outside of my door smells like it’s moldy and wet. I guess that’s why they had the air blower.  It just feels like they didn’t have any common sense want to turn it on and turn it off.  Also they should have not booked a room for anyone knowing they had that outside the door.
50,Everyone at the front desk was helpful. Housekeeping did a great job everyday during my 6 night stay. Hotel was neat and clean. I loved that it was a non smoking hotel. Location was great and it was easy access to the tram.
50,Great casino and fresh air (non smoking)!! Had a small issue with our room during a Valentines get away and Jonathan at the VIP desk went above and beyond to resolve quickly. The staff made sure our stay was a memorable one. Bobby the security guard by the elevators kept me safe and with good comedy conversation while waiting for my girlfriend to come down from the room (we still need to link up in San Diego for those tacos! haha). Great location on the strip and close to the stadium. Highly recommend and will definitely stay here again!  P.S. be sure to get the BBQ Ribeye at the on site restaurant Best Friends by Roy Choi ...so bomb!
50,The meal and cocktails at The Library at Nomad were one of the best dining experiences we’ve ever had.  We also booked a gazebo at the Nomad pool for a day and it was well worth the rental. Great service and a relaxing day.
30,My husband and I decided to do a Wanderlust this year for his birthday. After driving four days across the US everything we try to accomplish in Vegas was complicated. In order to utilize a free night that requires one trip to the MGM rewards desk but that is after you’ve stood in line at the front desk to check in because you can’t do it on the Internet. Then every time we wanted to cash in a reward through the MGM rewards that required another 2 to 3 times at the MGM rewards desk. If you want to use a free play a Park MGM you first have to pay for the nights stays. Our free nights were on the front end of our reservation therefore I could not cash in on that until day three. And the rewards really are nothing. Be prepared if you’ve never been because there are no microwaves or coffee makers anywhere in Vegas. To get a round of coffees and danish in the morning was an easy $50 per day
20,I came for work and had a terrible sleep on that bed with a massive dip i tried to sleep on the couch instead and there was someone elses garbage under the cushions (terrible cleanliness for a first trip since covid) and the bell guy Harold was condescending and awkwardly rude for zero reason. I hope you have cameras so you can see the very strange and uncalled for behaviour while checking in my luggage. Im still so confused why he picked me to be so rude too. He also wouldnt quit.. i had to take my tag and walk away while he continued on. I hate this place and it would take one hell of a gesture to have me try this again. As a wedding planner I was there on business and would never recommend this hotel for the wedding nor the guests to stay. What an awful experience.
50,We stayed at the Park MGM for the week to celebrate our anniversary. With my wife being pregnant we were able to enjoy our week without having to worry about smoke anywhere in the property. One of the highlights of our trip was right at the Dolby Live as we attended the hilarious duo Silk Sonic (Bruno Mars and Anderson .Paak). The Dining/Take-out options within the Park were great as always. All in all the Park once again gave us a wonderful time on our vacation.
20,Sad to say the rooms are a catfish of the pictures. Our room was dirty with stained carpets and furniture. I showered with sandals on because I was scared I would catch something otherwise. It felt like a public gym bathroom. This was my 5th stay in Vegas and most expensive hotel and worst experience so far.
50,The amenities and rooms are top-notch but it's the people that make it great. In particular Andres Ramirez went above and beyond to help me. I was locked out of my room and he stopped what he was doing to help. He is an incredibly hard worker who made the guest experience tremendous. My family is staying at Park MGM when we got back almost exclusively because of Mr. Ramirez.
30,We stay 3 nights and not even a single night clean the room  the staff from game tables are rude  the reason we decided to stay in this hotel is cause the Bruno Mars concert was here  next time we will not consider this hotel
50,Thank you for another great stay Park! I love that the Park is non smoking :) THe location is fantastic the food and drink options are great and I always feel very comfortable and happy here! The beds are so comfortable and the water pressure in the showing is AMAZING! Being so close to NYNY gives you double the options as well  and there is a tram connected to the hotel that can take you to Aria if you wish! The front desk agents were lovely as were all employees that I encountered! Ill be back!
20,We were so looking forward to staying in a smoke-free hotel but the quality of the accommodation was poor. The bed and pillows were terrible the carpet was not clean and the toilet paper was one-ply; unbelievable!
50,Gabriel in security made us feel welcome as soon as we walked through Park MGM's doors. He answered all our questions about Eataly and the hotel. He is a great representative of your organization. We felt at ease knowing he was there to protect and serve.
50,Perfect place for anniversary weekend. Make sure you see Belinda at the concierge desk for all of your needs. If you’re going as a couple rent a daybed and stick to the east pool. South pool pods are nice but full of families and kids that splash
20,If you are newbie to Vegas you might be ok with park mgm. If you’ve stayed at other casinos be aware you will be highly disappointed! Rooms are small no coffee no frige too slot machines are tight casino and rooms smell old.
50,The rooms were extremely clean and checkin at the VIP desk for MGM rewards members was quick and easy. We loved the location of Park MGM next to the arena we were attending for an event and great food options!
50,Booked last minute and decided to use Expedia deal where you don't know which hotel you will get until you book. I was pleasantly surprised and couldn't be happier with the hotel. Great staff great rooms and great location!
40,The hotel was great. Love that its non-smoking clean friendly staff and great restaurants. The room we had was spacious and cozy and pool area very lovely and relaxing. Close to everything/on the stip. It was quiet at night(when we were there anyway) Used MGM rewards for lots of things rooms food and drinks highly recommend MGM rewards.  Big drawback for us was that the rooms don’t even have a coffee maker. Have to get ready in the morning and go down to get coffee and breakfast! Can’t bring back leftovers no fridge or microwave.  Overall though wonderful hotel.
50,We stayed here for a week in May. The rooms were nice and the bed was very comfortable. I liked that there were a few drawers in the closet. Love that it is non-smoking. We will absolutely stay here again on future trips!
50,Location food options rooms...adults only pool were fantastic...really recommend this location especially when travelling with adults only! The room renovations are very nice and the decor of the hotel is gorgeous!
50,Good location very clean and comfortable. Also had access to tram to Bellagio and other hotels which was convenient. I loved that it was entirely smoke-free including at the casino. Would definitely stay here again.
50,The hotel was so clean and thankfully didn’t smell like smoke. We loved the non smoking option. It was all new feeling and very spacious. Our room was huge. The food options were amazing and the Eataly was the cutest little spot ever with such good options.
40,Stop Charging Guest For Parking. Other than that it was a good experience. The rooms were good and the service was great. Fun casino with a good vibe. Could use a 24 hour Cafe in the hotel. Nice pool and hottub..
20,Extremely thin walls - it feels as though your neighbors are literally in the same room as you. The hallways are dark with low ceilings. Upside is there is no smoking in the casinos and conveniently located.
20,Extra $300 hold on your card with no notice. Non smoking. Card info was stolen staying here. Husbands phone was also almost hacked but he caught it. Room was eh super tiny dresser. Vending was empty.
50,Excellent service received from all hotel staff! We felt right at home at every turn - all around the entire property. Rooms are nice sufficient size to accommodate 3 - 4 guests in a double room. Liking forward to a suite stay next visit!
50,Definitely worth the stay considering the team to aria and Bellagio is right there as well for the price it’s a great location and hotel and the food…. Spectacular. I definitely plan to stay here again next time I’m in Vegas
50,I love staying and playing at the Park MGM! The entire casino is nonsmoking which is excellent in my opinion! There are numerous restaurant choices and the location is great! I would highly recommend staying at the Park MGM.
50,Awesome room  lots of towels and pillows. Quiet no nonsense brats . Fantastic view of the T Mobile Stadium THANK YOU. Very friendly staff. Would definitely stay again. Perfect location. Thank you staff for making our stay enjoyable.
40,The beds are lower to the floor than I expected. However the room was nice and different. I had great sleep. My floor was quiet and the stay in the room was peaceful. No soak bath only a shower. Nice comfy couch. The waitresses on the casino floor took too long with our orders.
50,Location of this hotel is perfect. Across the street from the arena attached to the aria. On the tram line to the Bellagio. Primrose breakfast is amazing and our dinner at Bavettes was as well. Hotel is not too busy and smoke free is fantastic.
40,Nice pools love smoke free environment great food choices casino has something for everyone. Rooms very modern so reason for my mid score bed could be more comfortable and no fridge in room. Having stayed at several other hotels on the strip you cannot beat the location.
50,We find the Park MGM our choice because it is an entirely smoke free hotel. The accommodations are very nice and the rooms although lack clothes storage are comfortable. The room service is ok and there are options on where to eat.
50,We used to stay at the Monte Carlo before the remodel and then favored the Mirage for years but the new Park is the best. Not too big but feels festive great food options attentive cocktail service cool room decor and comfy beds. And we like the way it sounds and the music choices in the casino.    The non-smoking is THE BEST additional feature.
40,Fantastic mid-range property on the Strip! Came here for my birthday weekend and loved our stay. There’s a lot to talk about so I’ll try and keep it concise.    PROS:  Great location on Strip  Clean rooms  Comfy bed  Free tram to Shops at Crystals and the Bellagio  Mini market in the lobby for cold drinks water and grab-and-go snacks  Awesome pool (perfect temperature too!)  Starbucks  Plenty of dining options    CONS:  No mini fridge/ microwave in room  Walls seemed thin. We could hear everything going on in the room next to us.  Poor water pressure in the shower  $9 delivery fee for room service    We stayed for 3 nights and it was a perfect home base on the Strip. I would say the amenities I mentioned definitely outweigh the negative aspects of the room.
40,Nice clean casino non smoking is a HUGE WIN ...we went to several other casinos and couldn't even stay in a few of them due to the smoke. Nice pool options reasonable prices for pool menu Rooms are clean
30,Loved the location & my room accessibility to the Dolby Live Theatre. But the room was ok. The couch was covered in animal hair & the carpet could’ve been cleaner for the price I paid. I appreciated having daily room service again.
40,everything but the bed and pillows was awesome!! the mattress was no support and sagging in the middle and the pillows were super stiff!! the bathroom was dirty as well!! mold and mildew in the shower and the toilet had pubic hairs and urine drops around the rim!! the location can't be beat as well as the different food establishments offered!!
20,This resort needs to do something with their rooms. They are outdated tired and not very clean. The room was a huge disappointment and the walls are so thin. You can hear your neighbors. It’s just too bad the pool area was lovely.
30,I've written other reviews of my stays here at Park MGM. I've previously rated it with FIVE STARS. I love the fact that it's non-smoking! It's in a good location and housekeeping is excellent. It's very clean. We really enjoy the crews who work the craps tables.    The reason for the lower rating this time is the room itself. In general the rooms are not fancy but this one was...just not up to par. I'm guessing it had originally been part of a suite and was made an individual room when the hotel was remodeled.    There was no closet at all. There was a cabinet that was attached to a wall with space to hang a few things. An ironing board was leaned up against this cabinet--right out in the open. There was not a dresser of any kind. There were no drawers. Everything just had to be left in the suitcases the whole time. The bed was so very hard. It was not at all comfortable.    I reserved a standard King Room. I don't know why we were assigned this one. We've stayed here when we had to pay full price even though we could have had rooms comped at Venetian or Orleans because we enjoy it being a non-smoking property. I may need to rethink that regarding future visits.
40,We really enjoyed our stay here. An amazing concert experience a short walk away from the elevator. A smoke free environment which is literally a breath of fresh air! Nice food options and easy access to other great experiences on the strip (i.e. Aria Bellagio MGM Grand...)
50,Again I really enjoyed staying here. I didn't let the fact that when I left my phone and ID at one of the machines and someone walking out with them and not turning them in bother me too much. I was a bit worry about my return but I knew we would find a way to get me into the flight.
50,My husband I stayed at Park MGM for 4 nights - great time! We checked in and out quickly with no waiting using the MGM apps. Non-smoking!!! Nomad Library and Bavettes are both well worth it but very different from each other - enjoy!
50,We really liked the location and if attending a concert at the Dolby it is perfect. We liked that it wasn't crazy Vegas and had a nice vibe to it. Starbucks right downstairs staff was nice except the younger taxi asst staff person was a snob. Very rude. The older gentleman was terrific. We would definitely stay there again due to its location amenities and vibe.
50,This was my second time staying at the Park MGM And I will most likely stay here again in the future. It is the only fully non-smoking property on the strip and it shows. Everything is clean. The staff is great there’s plenty to do in the resort and seems is appropriately priced. Eataly is phenomenal as are the individual restaurants scattered throughout.
20,Hotel was very busy checked in at 2PM (1 hour before check-in time) and was told my room wasn't ready yet and would get a text message by 3PM when it's ready. Never received any texts.    Room was okay standard 2 queen beds no mini fridge. Shower and sink had very poor design. Bathroom sink is a flat square and water does not reach anywhere in the sink so things always got stuck on the sink... very unsanitary. Bathroom was poorly designed too and leaked from the bottom of the door. Bathroom floor is always a floor after showering.
10,We booked two rooms at Park MGM btw I’m considered “VIP” because of MGM rewards. In the first room we were by dirty clothes and shoes left inside our room plus everything was covered in dog hair from the bed to the tables.    Second room was ok until they started construction right in front of it. So much notice and mess right outside the door.
50,Newly remodeled in the heart of the action on the strip. Great access up an down the Strip lots of restaurants you can walk to or take the free tram. Great access great venue use the MGM app to check in and check out no lines to worry about!!
50,Excellent service exceptionally clean hotel great security. Love that you can only get to your floor with access through you key. Restaurant in the hotel food was delicious. We enjoyed our 20 year anniversary.
50,Had a great experience staying here recently. Staff went above and beyond when assisting with checking in to speed up the process. The room was very clean nicely renovated and comfortable as well. No fridge in the room without an extra charge but that seems to be a standard for all hotels on the strip so wasn't a big deal.
40,Resort is nice and clean and we definitely loved that it is a non smoking hotel. Easy access to other MGM resorts due to the tram. But it is a 4 star hotel and we are used to nicer amenities. Rooms are small!
50,My stay was great after I figured out the key and elevator thing. The room was spacious and comfortable. Bathroom was very clean and well stocked with soaps and shampoo. And the location was central to a lot of places I just walked to. Great place to stay and I will definitely return here.
50,My first time being to Vegas and my experience was amazing even the dealers at the table were helpful had a amazing time the only thing I have to say that was a con is the price of food but I expected that
30,In town for business conference. Love that Park MGM is a NON SMOKING HOTEL but rooms are in need of updating including adding refrigerators to the rooms in order to compete with other providers on the strip. I last styed here in 2019 (pre-pandemic) and remember the facility being much nicer and cleaner.
40,My son was turning 37 years old and we come to Vegas where he lives to celebrate every year. All in the family that can come do so to join in the celebration. Saw Shim Lim show and it was fabulous!  Best restaurant we ate at is Carbone.
40,"This was our fourth time staying at Park MGM/Nomad. Nomad is the more boutique hotel located on the top floors of Park. Now that almost everything is back to per-pandemic levels Park has kind of become our go to hotel/casino. The no-smoking policy of the resort is an absolute joy! The overall look and vibe of the resort is casual/cool and you cannot beat the great central location. We've eaten and drank at pretty much every place ark has to offer. We did the fine dining at Bavette's great food and drink but pricey. Great for a special occasion. We love the food and drinks at Eatly again not necessarily the cheapest place to eat but you know your going to get some good tasting food. Best Friend is a Los Angeles based Korean Fusion restaurant with some great dishes I loved it. Primrose for breakfast was my go-to again not cheap but good food and big portions the way I look at it about the same price as Starbucks right next door but better food and service plus it's a sit down. The most casual place to eat is Side Betty which is next to the Sportsbook/Sportsbar good selection of your basic food groups i.e. burgers and fries!  It was quite busy on the casino floor on the weekends when the artists who have residencies currently playing like Silk Sonic Lady Gaga and Usher.  The rooms are very minimalist in design and decor in both Park and Nomad but comfortable. Our latest stay was in a ""Staywell"" room which has air and water enhancements. We love the exclusive feel when we stay at Nomad which has a dedicated drive up area registration and bank of elevators! We plan to stay again in July in an upgraded Atelier room at Nomad."
50,Very convenient location very close to all locations on the strip I like the good clean condition of the rooms make feel like home  my family is always using this facility when they have a chance to go to Vrgas I will recommended for sure to my friends
20,The hotel is dark dingy and very small rooms with out any VEGAS VIBE! Our room was on floor 3 without any view. Check in was a disaster. Keyless entry did not work on our phone so we had to bring ourselves with our luggage back to the Hotel Lobby for help. Prepaid parking did not work with the phone app. Our room was so dark and small. Not well thought out. No nightlights or the small things that make it a great hotel room. The pools have a nice laid back vibe. But we showed up about 8:45 am twice to get in at 9:00am (opening time) and both days the pool did not open until at least 9:15 am. Not very professional. I would not recommend Park MGM.
50,Great rooms and located so close to other casinos and restaurants. Eatly is a great area for a quick snack or an excellent meal. The tram to other casinos helps with all that walking. The pool area is huge and very inviting.
40,Everything was excellent except the table game limits were too high and forced us to gamble mostly at other casinos. Bj was ok. Craps and 3card P were too high.  Have been a regular visitor to Vegas for over 40 years.
50,Very nice rooms close to all the shopping places we wanted to go to. Bruno Mars  (Silk Sonic) concert was there so made it so convenient. The smoke free casino was such a pleasant environment. Will stay again.
50,Awesome The room was very clean and comfortable. The staff was very friendly and every time I called the front desk I got a friendly voice and I never had to wait for anything. I will definitely stay there again.
50,Enjoyed theNO SMOKING policy.  Hope all the Casino Hotels will follow suit.  The casino is clean and safe.  Even eating by myself in the Restaurant in EATALY was pleasurable. The staffs are friendly and courteous.  Loved view in room
40,Quite clean and eat Italy makes the best coffee and apricot croissants 🥐❤️. I did have four  night comp. but from my Vegas app that travel ruby youtuble blogger used and supports I received two comped days threw the app. I was paying three nights with no help because I was in Vegas for seven days and staying at the park. . I went to your vip desk was told and said sorry we can’t help you. You should have summit before you came. I did and read the rules. Your vip didn’t care to read and said hope you enjoy the remainder of your stay. I will be coming back to Vegas but maybe because they are YouTubers they are treated differently. Not sure.
50,Check in great room and all services excellent. I would highly recommend this hotel. All foodpool bell desk services. Restaurants were all excellent. Having casino completely non smoking a definite plus. Casino was very good. All employees were very helpful.
50,Very friendly staff and love the no smoking. We loved eating at the Eately. The Park MGM is very clean. The only thing that would have made our stay better was coffee pots in the rooms. I would stay here again next time I come.
50,Loved that is was smoke free! First time here at this resort. Everything was nice slots a little tight. Enjoyed would come again. Just retired also birthday gift for my son. Pool area looked nice but weather was a little cool the four days we stayed.
50,We had A Great time !! It was A girls trip get away we had a blast. We loved the pools  the little Italy an will come back to visit ..Customer card was very helpful to transfer freeplay from Beau Rivage in Bilixi Mississippi
50,I used the Park MGM to host a business meeting. Stayed extra days for other meetings in town. The staff was all great. Clearly the hotel is a bit understaffed as is every hotel coming out of Covid. Every single person I dealt with was helpful and friendly.
10,No service at all. They may not welcome you to extend your room even you can find they have availability on their website they can still turn you down. Be sure to contact your host before extend your room or stay cause apparently the front desk is not helpful at all.
50,Love the smoke free environment. The air is fresh just like in a real park. Enjoyed the casino the clean comfortable room and the restaurants. Our bed was very comfortable and we were able to relax and rest in our room. Had Starbucks every day and service was fast and friendly. Loved eating at the Primrose. We had an excellent breakfast and dinner.
50,We had a great concierge Joseph who saved our trip with a replacement show when ours got canceled. The Silk Sonic show at MGM was one of the best we’ve ever seen!  Although we went to a couple other casinos it was always nice to come back to ours without the smoke.  The location is good with other casinos within walking distance.  Very nice breakfast restaurant.
50,We were coming in and out of Vegas for a quick business trip and decided to try out the Park MGM. We loved our room very cozy and modern. Loved that this was a smoke free casino and had great dining options. It was clean we felt safe and can't wait until our next stay at Park MGM!!!
50,It was great having an entire hotel/casino be nonsmoking! The hotel was clean and didn’t feel old or dated. You could hear noise from adjacent rooms and the hallway. The food onsite at Eitaly was very good.
50,This was our first time to the Park MGM. Easily one of the best on the strip. Super clean and the entire building is non-smoking which is awesome!!! It smelled like flowers everywhere. The pool area is amazing and easy to get to. Casino was clean… great restaurants and the entertainment lineup is impressive. The market-style Italian food area “Eataly” was super fun to browse and order from.  The location is right in the heart of everything so walking on either side was cool. Can’t wait to stay here again.
30,I flew to Vegas from DC for the Soul Sonic (Bruno Mars) show being held in this hotel. Admittedly that was my primary reason for staying here over other Strip lodging options. It was great to be just an elevator ride away! But other area were lacking…  -when I checked into the room there were still dirty towels on my bathroom floor.  - I “valeted” my bags when pulled up to the hotel to checkin. When I called down (three times) to have them delivered to my room no one answered the phone number on my claim ticket. I ended up walking downstairs from my room TO PICK UP MY OWB BAG. Of course I wondered why I’d even tipped the attendant who took my bag of this was the end result.  - When I initially made my reservation I was told to bring proof of my AAA membership upon checkin for a 10% discount on my stay. When I reached the counter I was told that the AAA did not apply for my room. This was once I was already in the lobby. What a bAit and switch!  - knowing all of this with so many other hotel options on the Strip I probably would have gone elsewhere. Great Soul Sonic show though!
20,Room for EDC weekend was fairly pricy (expected) but room did not include a fridge microwave or hair dryer. While we brought our own hair dryer anyway I did not inquire about one but I imagine it would have been another nightly surcharge like the fridge and microwave (separate charges of course!)    Additionally room was far from great and besides a few generic pieces of “art” on the wall and a nice looking bathroom sink/mirror the room quality was about on par with your typical Motel 6.
50,The absolute best customer service on the strip! Cannot wait to return! From the valet bellman front desk restaurant staff and security department everyone went of if their way to make our stay memorable!!
40,I’ve stayed here many times and keep coming back. Great location. Concert venues. All the bartenders are great!  In December we stayed here for a concert. Went to the strip for some drinks then had dinner at Bevetts and then right to the concert. All right here at Park MGM. Easy peasy.
50,Very clean beds very comfortable I liked this being a no smoking hotel. Very convenient great staff I felt they went out of their way to help. Very convenient that the self parking is close to the room elevators.
50,This is one of our regular hotels when we visit Vegas which is quite often. It is convenient for concerts at Dolby Live Theatre and T-Mobile Arena. The casino and hotel are smoke-free. Best Friend NoMad Library and Primrose are all excellent restaurants.
40,Good hotel for a relaxing couples retreat. Smaller than some of the other hotels and not as central so not great for partying in Vegas. The pool is also small but good enough. Great value for the price. Clean rooms good beds and has affordable choices for food.
50,Pretty hotel not over the top. Nice pools rooms and a clean fresh feel throughout the facility. Good mix of restaurants and places to eat. Helpful and friendly staff. Conveniently located on the strip. Monorail was great to get back and forth to other properties and amenities.
50,We enjoyed our stay for four nights in a Nighthawk suite. The room was spacious although dusty. We had a great time seeing Silk Sonic and LOVE and enjoyed afternoons at the MGM Grand lazy River and Mirage pool. Eataly was convenient and food was ok. We also enjoyed watching sporting event and having dinner at Tap at the MGM grand and a nice dinner at Stack at The Mirage. We also loved that the Casino was smoke free!
30,Booked this hotel primarily to see Silk Sonic and the show was fantastic (although crazy expensive). The hotel is smoke free and that's a BIG plus. The rooms are average not bad. The food options on site are limited on weeknights.
40,Sadly the website is not transparent and if you try to call the hotel it is impossible to speak with a knowledgeable staff member. if you need a medical scooter be careful this hotel forces you to use their contract company only…no exceptions!
50,The Park MGM is the only hotel/casino that is smoke free. Absolutely love this. Always get a massage at the spa phenomenal staff and facilities. Favorite foodie spot is easily La la noodle the seafood and Brisket noodle soups always brings me joy!!! Highly recommended.
50,nice room nice casinos staff was friendly helped me out alot with directions and made sure everything was done right. Had a great view also from my room the room cleanliness was spot on room service did excellent job too
50,Very efficient layout makes it easy to navigate around the property Pool area is fantastic Loved the dining choices Cocktail service was great Many table games choices Friendly and knowledgeable table games staff
20,When I arrived at 2 AM my room was not clean and it took until 10 PM to get the room cleaned. Spoke with multiple customer service representatives and only two were helpful along the way. One front desk employee and manager told me that I needed to call housekeeping to deal with the issue on my own. how unprofessional! Small food credits were given but I would’ve preferred my room to simply be cleaned from the beginning.
50,It doesn’t get better than that. The views are incredible and the beds are very comfy in comparison to MGM grand’s hard beds. The pool had alcoholic slushees 3 pools and 2 bars. Everything can be charged to your room so there’s no hassle with losing your credit card. Check out was easy as well. To park you should go to regular check in so you have your physical room key to use as a garage card.
10,Check in was swift and easy. The room was on the 22nd floor and had plastic and fan chain holding up the shower curtain in a dated bathroom. The 2 drinking glasses were dirty. No fridge. Manual curtains. And the bed was horrible. My fiancée spoke to front desk. We were moved up one floor to a much more satisfactory bathroom. However. The night we stayed on the casino floor gambling. Not much. A few thousand dollars. Played for a couple hours at craps. Ended up making a great run and a lot of people made money. Things closed down around 2am earlier depending upon the area of the resort. So by them time we were done at the table over the excitement and ready to head to the room. We stopped at the vending machine on our floor and it wasn’t accepting credit cards and I had 100’s so back to the first floor it was. My fiancée asked the front desk for some water. And they directed her (mind you she’s inebriated) to walk to cvs! SMH are. You. Kidding. Me! Your staffs first suggestion is take yourself outside in an unknown unfamiliar area and try to find walk to another store! Amazingly unacceptable. They could easily of found 2 water bottles and handed them to her. Directed her to a different vending machine. Etc. But their answer was to send her out of the resort with a “yea it’s over there somewhere”    Upon check out. I went to the front desk and asked. If a guest came up to the desk inebriated at 2:30/3am and asked for water what would your response be. And they said provide them a bottle of water offer assistance to the vending machine or have water besought your the room. I asked why was that not an option for my fiancée last night.
40,Carpets need updated in hallways rooms are very average with no little extras. Overall nice place but nothing special. Everything was clean in the room and no complaints just don’t expect any extra perks in the rooms.
50,Park MGM has become my hotel of choice when visiting Las Vegas. It's easy to navigate-from parking to guest room. The rooms are clean and comfortable easy and fast check in using the app and phone. I usually attend concerts at Dolby Live so I love the convenience of the venue being at Park MGM.
10,Why do I have to explain everything all over again? I left my comments before and now you want me to explain everything from the start calling this an overall experience?! It was horrible!!! That’s all I can say. Hope nobody will ever experience that I had with you guys! RUDE STAFFS!
50,Stayed in the Park have no complaints clean rooms staff was friendly and helpful conveniently located. Also stayed at the Grand they had same reviews as Park but had a lounge singer and C&W band in the bar. Loved both I gave stayef in other Casinos but these met my needs the most felt very comfortable.
50,Everything was great from staff friendless to cleanliness stayed here for EDC week only thing that would make this stay better if they had a mini fridge in the king room not sure if the other rooms do but other than that It was a great hotel!
50,Besides the excellent dining opportunities at the Park MGM you have the pleasure of a smoke-free gaming facility with all the varieties of slot machines..Rooms are bright clean and odor free; the shower head has above average pressure such a pleasant surprise.
40,While I enjoyed the room and the smoke free casino the night time temperature in the room wasn’t very comfortable. I understand the sensors to help with energy conservation but when you’re sleeping I don’t move much so the room has a tendency to warm up!
10,Compared to other properties in the area this is low budget. We had $200 stolen out of our room still have not heard back from security. We can kiss that goodbye. Staff was not very friendly. We had a machine break down in the casino and had to wait 30 minutes before anybody even came by to check on us half the service lights didn't even work on the machines. No refrigerator in the room the bathroom doors are sliders so there's no privacy. On the upside The Nomad pool was really cool
50,We had a wonderful stay at Park MGM last week (May 2022). The machines were a little tight compared to the last time we were there in 2021 but the service was fabulous and the rooms were great too. We will definitely be back!
50,Park MGM is only a few steps from the strip and totally smoke free!! Very quiet in room-- only heard noise from hallway one time (very loud people leaving early in the morning). Stayed here many times and always come back.
50,If you are looking for a clean and quiet hotel then Park MGM is perfect. It also provides quick and easy tram transportation to Bellagio and Aria. We have stayed at Park MGM twice in the past six months and will continue to stay there in the future.
50,smoke free casino was excellent! pool areas were clean waiter were very friendly! rooms were nice! overall experience was great! the table games were nice and clean and didn't have smoke being blown around while you were sitting at the tables.
50,Had very good room service with excelent timely registration time also. Enjoyed the room with great view excellent spacing with large TV. It was very helfull that the Park MGM having an ADA room when and location of flooring so that noise level was not to the point our Mom would be awaken by late night walkers.Againg we like to thank you for all your service and were are repete visitors at this property.
50,Park MGM is new and exciting. Restaurants had the best food. The food in the Eataly was well worth the money. Wine selection is super awesome. We love Italian wines. Park MGM advertises itself as a new concept resort with lots of selection in food and drinks. Its true. It does not disappoint.
50,Our experience during our stay was phenomenal. Staff went above and beyond and everyone was extremely friendly. The restaurants are great and its in a good location. Rooms were nice and clean. I especially enjoyed and recommend the mobile check-in feature and digital room card.
10,Truly one of the most unappealing hotel rooms I’ve ever seen. The hallways to the room were out of a horror film. It’s bad. I’ve never written a review before. I am shocked that this is an MGM property. My room had a shower that did not have a shower head— instead just a want that had such low water pressure it would take 3-5 minutes to get my hair wet. I was freezing during the shower cause there was such limited coverage. It felt like a hostel.
40,Went for a quick two day trip the hotel is very close to everything we usually do when we are there and the staff is very friendly. However if you are going for a special occasion or romantic get away there are better choices. The rooms are small the hallways are dark and dingy and the room itself is. Wry very average at best.
50,I had the best experience ever. I was in Vegas for my wedding and the staff accommodations food and everything was just great. I love the fact that we were able to attend the Silk Sonic Bruno Mars and Anderson Paak concert without leaving the Park MGM. No complaints
10,"Insanity from the adjacent room which was treated as ""expected"" by the front desk. Security showed up hours after being called. It was so bad I left a night early and chose to sleep at the airport vs one more night here."
30,Our room was gross. Casino was great. Horrible view. No dresser. No Fridge. Casino is nice but many shops and restaurants were not open. Rooms were extremely disappointing. Would not book there again.
30,"MOLD was growing in the shower in two different areas; one of which was a LOT of mold. My feet itched every time I got out of the shower. I called front desk to have some towels delivered (only after house keeping would not answer) and they said they would send them up. They never made it...ever. And we paid for a ""strip view"" room. Haha...that's a bit of a false advertisement. We have stayed at the property when it was the Monte Carlo and had great experiences. Things have certainly gone down hill."
40,This was a very pleasant place to stay and SMOKE FREE! The room was fine—large shower and comfy beds—but the price we paid was very disappointing given the fact that the standard room we had can go for less than $70/night during the week. The only problem we encountered during our stay was a very slow bathroom sink drain.  Our two queen room did not have a mini-fridge and beware of the $18 in-room water—OUCH!  I must say that we appreciated the size of the property—it wasn’t too large but had plenty of variety for our weekend stay. We also had wonderful interactions with all the staff.  All in all a convenient choice on the strip especially if you’re seeing something at Dolby Live but I hope we’ll be able to return for a more reasonable mid-week stay!
50,Great non smoking casino and rooms. The hotels location makes it very easy to travel the strip. I recommend eating at the restaurants in the lobby. Their Italian food selection is amazing and delicious.
30,the room was very basic no frig dresser shelf in bathroom. They gave us an attached room and we could hear everything the people in the other room were saying. The door between the rooms does not have any sound barrier.    The pool was nice and the staff was friendly. Vegas in general has gone downhill. Lots of homeless on the streets more than usual and it is really dirty.
50,The Park is a nice newer casino on the strip. It is smoke free-which was great! Rooms simpler in style but modern with nice bathrooms. (There is a Fancy tower section called Nomad-not where we stayed). It has three pools. Easy to drive there from airport and self park. There is a CVS next door and Target across the street. Stock up on water there if staying on the strip. There is a free tram that takes you to Bellagio. It was close to all the big Casinos but with out all the craziness of them.
10,Room walls sound like they r made of paper when u can hear the quietest whisper in the room next to u or in the hall. Just moving the blinds in the next room was so loud I thought someone was in my room moving the blinds. Only stayed because 2 nights free should’ve paid somewhere better.
50,I took my Mom to stay at Park MGM for Mother's Day and we had a wonderful stay! I really wanted to let the company know that Brewster from Security went above and beyond to show my Mom where on the property she could smoke a cigarette. He took us on a great tour of Park MGM with fun facts and useful information. My Mom was impressed and very appreciative of the special treatment from a staff member.
40,The wife and I were happy to be back in Vegas . First time staying at the Park MGM. Great location you step out the front of the Park MGM right onto the strip. The valets were awesome and very helpful. The room was the only issue we had. We had a 5th floor room looking at the wall across from us. No fridge in the room but you could get one for 35 dollars a day. REALLY  we had a fridge in the TI and every other room we had been in since 2009. WTH. The best part had to be Eataley at the front of resort. Outstanding Italian food and overall experience you have to try. Overall a great time was had .
50,First time staying here and loved the atmosphere and definitely will be staying here again on our next visit to Vegas !!! Everyone was so helpful and friendly . The pool area was perfect size for what we were looking for!!!
50,Park MGM has become our favorite resort when vacationing in Las Vegas. All aspects of that makes a resort a resort is excellent! The customer service rooms cleanliness culinary choices and location on the Strip checks off all our boxes. A huge plus is that they are the only smoke-free resort which we truly appreciate.
40,Park MGM is in a great location. Lots of places within walking distance with great restaurants. Inside the the Park MGM is a food court of nothing but Italian with a couple nice bars. The food was excellent!
50,Overall great experience. Hotel centerly located on the strip. Great restaurants. Not to overwhelming. Clean and has a classy feel. Eatily is a fun experience with wonderful food and deserts. Concerts at the Park are also very nice.
50,What a great stay! We chose this hotel because it was non smoking and because it appeared to have a quieter vibe than some of the other properties on the strip. It didn’t disappoint.    We took a taxi from terminal 3 which was $34.00 and 20 mins. Probably should have taken an Uber because I think it would have been cheaper. Check in was easy although the fellow at reception wasn’t very helpful to get the room we were looking for. We went back down and talked to Abby in VIP and she helped us out with a higher floor nicer view room. Much better. The room was comfortable and I liked the window seat couch idea. Good spot yo sit and have coffee in the morning and watch Vegas wake up. There is no coffee maker or fridge in the room which is standard Vegas. We bring a kettle and Starbucks instant coffee which works just fine for us. We also bring a soft side cooler and fill with ice from the ice machine which keeps our room drinks cold.    The location is perfect and well situated to get anywhere on the strip. There is a small Target across the street (4 min walk) that was nice and sold munchies little packages of fresh fruit sandwiches. Stuff for on the go. The big beers and coolers were cheaper here than in the hotel store or Walgreens. CVS on the same side of the street as the hotel was not a very nice store.    We ate at Lala Noodle an Asian fusion type place. Food was served hot and tasty and the service was good. We also had breakfast at Primrose a couple of times and it was amazing food and service. Very pretty inside. Eataly was great. Lots of options to chose from and good quality food. We were able to take our Eataly sandwiches to go and take them into the pool area. The security guards and other staff at the pool area were friendly and polite and generally seemed happy to welcome people into the area.    Pool area was beautiful. There are 3 pools; the south pool is quieter and gets sun most of the day; the North pool is busier and has more of a party vibe. The North pool also has a great sitting ledge around the edge of the pool which was perfect for the hot days; the east pool is an adults only pool and had a party atmosphere as well. Decent but small pool menu. We preferred bringing lunch in from Eataly. We never had any problem finding loungers and the hotel was about 80% capacity according to staff. A few of the days there were pool side massages offered which was handy.    We had a tour (Amazing!) of Allegiant Stadium one day and it was a 35 min walk back to The Park. Easy to navigate if that is your thing.    Casino is on the smaller side with not as many table games as some other places. Seemed to have a good variety of slots and always some available. Even won some $.    We took an Uber back to the airport and it was $16.00 and a much better ride than the taxi in the way in.    All in all most of the staff was friendly and professional. This will be our go to place from now on!
40,Was great to stay at a smoke free hotel in Vegas. Checked in from the runway when I landed and the room was ready by the time I got my luggage. No drama getting into the pool like I have experienced at other hotels. The gaming floor is not the biggest but its located close to trams and the monorail. Eataly just do it
50,Everyone always has a smile on their face and is always willing to help you find an answer to a question. 10/10 stay! The room was clean house keeping was amazing and the bar service was phenomenal. Cashiers were very friendly as well. Overall just a great stay.
10,Stay away!!!!!  Smoke free with a needle in your room!!!!  Dirty rooms!!!!!!  Not bitter or mad didn't loose any money I did not gamble there. Do not stay in their rooms for your own safety!!!!  A copy of what I wrote them.....    Horrible Hotel Experience!! So many reasons! 3 rooms it took to finally get my girl and 4 month old baby situated after a 6 hour road trip that should have been 4. We arrived with digital keys at 9PM. The 1st room was never cleaned from the last guest unmade beds beer bottles and trash scattered! and it did not contain the pre ordered refrigerator. The 2nd room had no bath tub for the baby as needed. The 3rd room after agreeing to only a single bed and a crib the A/C was broken. Later repaired by maintenence who he was great! Later only to find I Assume a HERION needle in the room!!!! Most likely still in the room!!!! WTF? No need to mention the fiasco with the several room keys not working between all the rooms and elevator!! Complete Disaster!!!! They added an extra $150 for food/beverage removed 2 days of resort fees and 1 day of room fee. This could never make up for the experience of my baby in the room with a Herion needle!!! Not a safe place!!!!!!!!Only missing roaches to go with it .... actually I did see one in the stairwell💨. 🙏🏽JESUS🙏🏽
50,The Park MGM has such a crisp clean ambience to the casino and hotel rooms. The smoke free atmosphere is the best thing! I feel welcome and very at-home in the entire casino/hotel/pool. The location on the strip is nice. Easy to use the tram to go to all the way to the Bellagio and places in between. Fun shopping across the strip at M&M and Coca-Cola stores. The clientele at Park MGM are average people. I always feel comfortable as a guest. The pool area is not as kid friendly as some other casino pools. Tends to be more quiet and not a huge party scene. Just right for relaxing at the pool.
30,Hallways dark carpet smelled not friendly staffi had to greet the staffno microwave or refrigerator in room had to throw my food away………arrives at 9am and was able to go straight to my room that was a plus  …………………………………
50,- In addition to being unable to check in early being able to check out early is not possible through the app. Luckily a human was available. VIP services jumped right into action and used logic to address my concerns. I understand policy as I write it for a living and VIP services was unscripted and unleashed in their delivery of my solution. 5 stars ✨✨✨✨✨
30,1st room was horrible smoke smell for a non smoking facility. Replacement room was poorly laid out w NO drawers and a cabinet style closet w 3 hangers and no room. Park MGM overbooked and no ability to correct the issues.
30,Check was really easy. Getting to our room was a long walk. One elevator for our floors room wasn’t cleaned properly especially the dirty gravel in the restroom with the dirt and mold. Additionally we had to pu for parking even tho we stood there.
50,Lovers and Friends fest. Park mgm never disappoints each time I stay there. Staff is always friendly especially assisting with express check in at the counter. Food at Eataly was also great. Will be going back as usual.
30,No refrigerator no microwave no coffee maker 5 hangers in the closet. It needs a facelift. Uber worked well. There's a tram that goes to the bellagio. That's nice. The rooms look like 1970's. On the plus side. Nice showers. Maids were never around
50,Great location. Restaurants are very good bars are nice. Eataly is fun to walk around good food. The Stay Well rooms are great beds are comfy - we had a great night sleep in a quiet room. Non-smoking casino is the BEST!
50,Excellent stay in Las Vegas. My one complaint is usually how smoking it is everywhere but Park MGM is 100% smoke free. So nice. Eataly is an excellent place for the Italian experience. Rooms aren't huge but they are very nice. Staff was helpful and friendly.
50,This was a family trip that we had to put off for 3 years (because of Covid19). So it was an amazing experience and we all had a wonderful time. We really enjoyed Eatly the food is over the top delicious.
50,Nice tidy room. Great location on south end of the strip so it was easy to walk or take trams to get around. Smoke free is a huge plus! Wish tables were a bit lower on minimum bets during quiet hours that would have kept us around even more. Solid dining experiences as well at Bavette and Best Friends. Eataly is always great as well.
30,Nice option for a smoke free hotel. Room did not have a coffee pot or mini fridge so you have pay a high price for the warm water in the room for purchase.hair dryer didn’t work. Nice shower. Average accommodations however we were comped so maybe they gave us both rooms that were just ok for that reason.
30,They didn't put us in a room we originally booked. When contacted their customer service non of the staff I had interactions with were helpful or kind. Didn't feel like an appreciated guest during our whole stay.
50,Smoke free fresh air! My suitcase didn’t need to be aired out for a week upon return home. We were able to get a table at Best Friends enjoyed the convenience of the Park MGM location and Pearl tier free parking.
10,Room had a terrible smoke smell. Like a slap in the face it was so bad. Shower had zero water pressure. The AC in room did not perform. This is totally a case where MGM put lipstick on a pig with recent remodel. Other MGM resorts are far better.
50,The Park lives up to the MGM standard of excellence in hotels. The layout makes it easy to navigate offers a number of excellent restaurant venues and provides tramway to the Bellagio Aria and Crystal shopping centre - one needn't leave the inside to travel to these other establishments for additional casino experiences buffet or restaurant choices.
40,I love the location and the people are very nice. Great restaurants. The thing that always makes me go back to another place is the rooms. There is no room for our clothes. I hate living out of a suitcase. There is no room for my wife and I to put our stuff away. Get a dresser!!!!! Not the little thing you have that takes up half the closet.
20,Upon entering the room it was very hot. We had to turn down the thermostat to 60 degrees before the temperature was remotely comfortable (much hotter than 60 degrees). The bathroom light was broken. When put on the lowest dimmer setting it simply flickered like crazy. The bathroom door allowed for no privacy. It was a sliding barn door that barely covered the opening.
20,The best thing about this place is that it is close to the strip. The Restaurant selection is minimal and very little seating. The non- smoking casino is not monitored well seen people smoking a few occasions also the hallways were smelling of weed from start to end. Walls are thin in the rooms you can hear everything TV and conversations next door. We had to leave our tv on to block out their sound.
30,Average nice check in not up on all the newer machines all confusing to me…. Not many of the older ones anywhere in Vegas … maybe downtown Coffee lines in the morning were very long… STARBUCKS has it all control…. and they close at 8pm… No locks on bathroom door??
50,Hotel was clean and well kept. Staff were friendly and knowledgable.  Prices were Las Vegas style but not over whelming like some of the over glitsy places up the road.  Breakfast is good in the restaurant and to hVe a Casino with no smoking is fantastic !  The rooms we found were a little smaller than expected but then again your in Vegas so you don’ spend much time in them. We really wanted to have a bar fridge and the hotel was able to accommodate us. The pools are plenty and lots of room for all. Having Eataly as part of our complex was great bonus.
50,We loved visiting Park MGM (which used to be the MonteCarlo). We love looking at architecture and all the cool colors and lights. We don't play any games that involve cards or dice because of our ability ot rapidly calculate mathematical probabilities (it wouldn't be fair to other players for us to play I mean would you want to play against a couple of Vulcans?). We were missing the old Montecarlo when we met Ghisel DeLeon and we realized that Park MGM is even better. Yes the high class friendly and cool atmosphere has gotten even better. Ghisel spent time talking with us about the casino the shows math savants and a lot of other cool topics. It was one of the best short conversations we've had in a long long time. Ghisel even wished my wife a happy Mother's Day. I'm telling ya folks if you want to meet a super cool person who can steer you to the right shows right restaurants and help you out with any questions go meet Ghisel. You'll be glad you did. Also we've visiting Vegas since 1993 and we know a high class operation when we see one. Great job to Park MGM on creating a great atmosphere and a great customer-oriented culture.
40,The food and service was amazing staff are helpful courteous and very friendly!!! I would stay again for sure.  I do think the rooms could have more amenities a microwave mini refrigerator and a coffee pot. People go out to eat and if they want to bring food back they don’t have a refrigerator to keep it in. Late nights are a given in Vegas coffee in the morning would be great. The Starbucks line at the hotel is CRAZY in the mornings like over 30 minutes to order and get your coffee.  Overall it was a nice stay.
20,The first room they assigned me was filthy. The beds were unmade and the comforter was on the floor. The bathroom was dirty and the room obviously hadn’t been cleaned. They gave me a different room when I complained and the second room was ok but had hair in the bathroom sink and floor and found a few on the bed. I was too tired to complain at this point and just dealt with it since I was checking out early the next morning anyways. Besides the rooms being dirty this hotel was good. It was in a good location easy to get around to other attractions. I chose this hotel cause I saw a concert at the Dolby which is inside this hotel and less then a five minute walk from my room to the venue which was great.
40,The Park MGM provided a great stay for me and my girlfriend. The location of the property is perfect as it's located near many other properties on the strip and are a close walking distance. The free tram was a lifesaver and made navigating around the strip very efficient. For us it's the star of the Park MGM. We also really loved the selection of restaurants at this property. Best Friend and Crack in particular were two of our favorites. We were blown away by the nighclub and speakeasy On The Record. There was far more than meets the eye. Incredible property awesome location and great price. However I do have to point out the dark and dingy hallways in the guest floors. We had the base standard room and were a little displeased by the space. Although it was perfectly functional the room itself just seemed a little outdated. This was by no means a deal breaker for us as we spent little time in our room. Once again the Park MGM is a great property and one that we'd definitely recommend staying at!
50,From the moment we checked in till the moment we left the staff was very friendly. The rooms and the casino were very clean.The Primrose restaurant had a very good breakfast. I would definitely stay there again
50,Park MGM Hotel was surprisingly good! I had read all negative reviews but I have to say we had a good experience. Hotel rooms was super clean service was amazing and the restaurant specially Primrose were great! I recommend staying here!
30,This property has great security with access to guestroom floors limited to room key holders. If attending a show at Dolby Live the property is convenient. The staff is friendly and helpful. The outdoor restaurant and pool areas are lovely. Would not stay for more than a night or two.
50,I had a great night at park MGM. I stayed because my flight got cancelled and I neeeed a room and it was only $50 on hotwire for a sat night that’s great! I always stay at Thr Mirage when I’m in Vegas but since it’s non longer going to be a resort I have been thinking about where I will stay and park will be the place. Love the rooms and the casino  eataly is amazing and the pool area is beautiful and lastly but most important the staff was great.
40,Your Reservations Staff were very helpful prior to my vacation. When I checked-in your Concierge Staff too we’re helpful with direction and courteous service manner. And your Front Desk supported my sense of helplessness with friendly and welcoming assurances of starting my stay.
50,Experience was rewarding. Rooms were clean & staff did everything to make sure I had a great experience. Enjoyed the fact that the hotel & casino were smoke free. Restaurants were amply staffed & food was cooked to perfection.
50,My husband and I stayed here for my birthday weekend. The hotel is in a great location to walk to a number of restaurants and bars that we wanted to visit. We did not like the options for dining within the hotel as they were very pricey. This wasn’t a huge issue because we were able to walk to other more affordable options. The hotel is clean (and smoke free) and the staff was friendly and welcoming. The rooms were nothing fancy but they were comfortable and good enough for a place to sleep after being out all day (or night)! Overall a great hotel and stay experience.
50,Everything was perfect Babette’s is one of the best restaurants we’ve ever been to everything is always been wonderful including the cocktails in the service we will always return there when we are in Vegas
40,Non-smoking hotel!!! That would pretty much sum up our stay. So grateful that we can enjoy all the amenities that Las Vegas has to offer without all the smoke and bad smell!!! Overall staff are friendly and the restaurants are amazing! Very close to everything without being right in the crowd!
50,It was great  I won some money on the slot machine . I was there for the Silk Sonic concert with Bruno Mars. The only thing I didn’t enjoy was your restaurant. There was not a variety of places to eat and the food was not great .
40,Nice comfy room good restaurants smoke free casino. Check-in with mobile phone was a breeze. Nice pools and hot tub. Tram to Bellagio was a plus. The staff was very helpful. Wish room would've had a mini fridge though
50,Really like the hotel rooms and the bar tenders at Eataly were fantastic. I love that there is a lot of room in the king size bed room. It could use another chair but that’s my only critique. Also the barn door isn’t that functional when one is in the bathroom and the other is getting dressed. But overall it’s was a great stay.
50,Amazing property and really well designed suites. My one and only complaint is that the room while otherwise impeccably clean did not appear to have been dusted in a very long time. There was dust every where on s  Window sills and even the bedside table. I would stay again though. Comfortable bed huge tile shower awesome retro mod design nice pool close to everything smoke free casino eataly friendly staff!
50,Loved the non smoking hotel rooms and the casino floor. The pools were great and all of the staff we had contact with were top notch. The restaurants were great as well. Thanks for making our mini Mother and daughter vacation great.
50,We love the Park MGM. Great location great atmosphere nice rooms  good set up with casino in front and check-in desk/transportation /elevators /tram in the back for easy access to hotel guests. Also its not a huge property like some others making it more comfortable and easy to get around within.
50,Love the smoke free everywhere. Very nice accomodation. Check-in was easy. Nice central location on the strip. Good variety of slot machines and tables. Lots of nice restaurants. Could do with another coffee shop as Starbucks was very busy.
40,Love that this is a non smoking establishment. Room was great size. Location was great with the tram so close. CVS is right next door and there is a bridge to the other side right out the door. Would definitely stay again.
50,Hotel is very clean and smoke free. The beds/ pillows were comfy as compared to other casinos on the strip. Love the Eaterly is a must for food and drink options to try. Gaming was also a fun experience with many slots to play.
50,Our room was great the casino was very clean. Anytime we need something for our room they would bring it up. The customer service was very awesome and treated us very well. M life was very helpful in our comp.
50,Check in and room assignment was easy and touchless. I was able to get my room assignment and key without going to the desk.  Loved the digital key. I did not have to worry about losing my room key. Hotel and room was neat clean and up to date.
50,This is our favourite Vegas hotel because they have a great pool deck and the ENTIRE resort is non smoking- WOW! Rooms are comfortable though they could use more storage for clothes etc. I suggest to order more hangars.  Great location. Close to other casinos like Aria New York  cosmopolitan. MGM grand. Good budget shopping across the street- Ross Burlington and Marshall’s.
50,Friendly helpful staff.Clean accommodations. Many activities to choose from.Casino smoke-free is great! Ate at Primrose and Bavette's. both were fabulous. I love the access to my room parking check-in all on my phone.
30,Room was small but pleasant. No where to put your luggage not even a luggage table. But was clean and doable. I like that it was smoke free. Location wasn’t the best but not the worst. Sits behind New York New York. Primrose was excellent for breakfast.
50,It was absolutely amazing the entire property being smoke free makes this my favorite place in Las Vegas. We will definitely stay again. Great restaurants and such a wonderful experience. Clean modern rooms and friendly staff.
50,This hotel was great for my family. We stayed here over Mother's Day weekend. Great service all the way around. I loved that is was a smoke free hotel & the pools were actually kid friendly. The rooms were also very spacious bed were so comfortable.
50,The customer service was top notch with friendly staff members that cared about my needs. The room was outstanding with a great view. The restaurants on property were ouy of this world goodwill excellent meal options.
50,We had an amazing time. Great food great staff great room great that the property is completely non-smoking. Loved being in a casino that had fresh air as well as in the pool area. Eataly is just an amazing place to eat.
50,Excellent stay and first-time experience in Las Vegas. The hotel room was very comfortable and the bathrooms were nicely updated. A great location on the strip provides easy access to other casinos restaurants and shops. We really enjoyed the food at Eately and simple access to the tram to the Bellagio.
50,Excellent service along with comfortable and clean rooms and hallway. Love the fact that it’s Non-Smoking including the casino. Assortment of restaurants and cafés inside the hotel along with a Denny’s and Hard Rock Cafe across the street. Pretty centralized location along the strip.
50,Excellent location smoke free. Awesome . Enjoyed the restaurant’s as well. Suite was very accommodating and nice size. Looking forward to our next trip to Vegas. Silk Sonic concert was the icing on the cake. Best concert ever.
50,Non smoking on the entire property is wonderful. Check in and out was easy. Love the location.  Eataly is a must see and do. Our room was immaculate with a nice view of NY NY roller coaster. Room security is excellent.
50,Like the pre check in walk straight to your room & maximize your time. The no smoking environment throughout the entire hotel & casino is most enjoyable for my well being. The pool and service was 1st class. Fresh water bottles in an ice bucket all day long.
50,Park MGM was amazing clean and just overall an amazing experience. Definitely will stay there again in the future. The best think about it the hotel was the smoke free building. I could actually enjoy breathing fresh air throughout the hotel.
50,Went on a 2 day trip to Vegas and stayed at the Park MGM. was a great trip to decompress and relax. Will definitely be coming back in late July to be exact!! Staff was great and location is central to almost everything
40,Great hotel in a perfect location clean rooms just a tad bit on the nosier side between rooms. Great location for TMobile park for concerts walking the strip or seeing shows. All you need is here great hotel!
50,This was a girls trip that included my wife and 4 of her cousins with my wife being the only previous guest at Park MGM. The connecting rooms were just what they wanted very clean comfortable and convenient. The pool was beautiful and service was exceptional Eataly was out of this world delicious with outstanding service.
50,We had a great stay at the Park MGM. The restaurant options were plentiful location was great and the pools were beautiful with no shortage of chairs. My only complaint is that there is no mini-fridge in the room.
50,10/10. Great location & VERY friendly staff! They also have 3 pools! The casino is always busy which makes it feel like a lot is going on even without leaving the hotel (which I like).  A ton of great food had dinner at Best Friend & La La Noodle both amazing. Picked up a variety of desserts at EATALY. Delicious!
50,Amazing Amazing! Clean fresh smell good hotel and casino. Is worth every Penny. People at check in go above and beyond. Great customer service. Clean rooms clean pools. Best friends restaurant is a must!
10,Extremely strict with rules that don’t apply anywhere else on the strip. Might be okay if you’re bringing your kids to Vegas for a hockey game but if you’re looking for the true Vegas do yourself a favor and stay somewhere else.
50,Park MGM was very clean the beds were very comfortable and the location on the strip was perfect. It was within walking distance to various shopping other hotels/casinos and many dining options. The service from the waitresses could have been better in the casino. We were often down there for hours with very few offers for drinks. There were three pools one heated and a jacuzzi. The pool side food wasn't as good as MGM Grand. You can also use the rooftop pool at Nomad but it was only open one day while we were there which happened to be a chilly day so we didn't get to experience it.
50,I have stayed here twice and both times was a pleasant experience at an affordable price. I love the Italian mixture of cuisines at Eataly. The room and bed were comfortable. The staff was always attentive to my needs. Thank you for such a wonderfult time in Las Vegas!
20,No fridge no dressers small closets with 2 hangars. Pool bar drinks were made different every time. When asking about rewards staff knew little to nothing especially the VIP rewards desk. Cleaning people refused to vacuum another guests room.
50,We had a great stay at Park Mgm. No problems to resolve. Rooms were clean. Great places to eat in the hotel as well and lots of things to walk to close by. Didn’t like that they charge for parking now…
30,My husband and I stayed two nights last week and there was definitely stuff on the walls and floor. The shower is a great feature except that the glass door has a 1-2in opening where it connects to the wall and causes water to get all over the bathroom floor. Also the rewards program is a joke unless you have a large amount of money to spend because there is no free play unless you spend enough to earn about 1000 points on slots.
20,I have stayed at a lot of hotels on the strip high quality and lower quality and this hotel was by far the worst. The smells were awful the decor was very old and that rooms were dark and old. everything felt dirty. The shower was gross with mold and orange tile. The staff at the pool was great. The front desk wasn't terrible but apparently didn't do their part when I added a guest to the room so I had to be woken up in the middle of the night when she arrived to let her in our room because they had no record of her name on the room. For the amount of money I spent I would stay elsewhere.
40,We received two free nights using MyVegas app rewards so we chose Park MGM. We booked Saturday on our own and were able to stay in the same room all three nights. Check-in was efficient using the mobile app and kiosks. We got there at 8 a.m. and were able to check our luggage until the room was ready. Once we checked in our luggage was brought up quickly.  We stayed in a King bedroom with strip view. Since the hotel is set back from Las Vegas Blvd our view was not amazing but still decent.  It was a hot weekend and we could not get the room to stay cool. The bell hop suggested lowering to 66 but the fan would only turn on for a little while and it was hot in our room each night.  The bed is comfortable and there are lamps/plugs on each side of it.  However when I looked at the nightstands I noticed they had not been dusted. The dining table was also very dusty and the couch had dust and stains on it.  Shower was on the bigger side with good water pressure and temperature.  I was disappointed that there wasn't a coffeemaker or fridge in the room. It was a hot stay/weekend and we wanted to keep water cool.  Overall we had a decent stay. The bars restaurant casino and pool are all beautiful. Great location so you can get on the Deuce or easily catch a rideshare. And less than 10 minutes away from airport.  Eat at Best Friend on the first level! You will not regret it.
10,I was given an adjoining room and could hear every single word that was said by neighbors (who were not in my party). After going to complain/request re-assignment of room the following morning the staff did not apologize and were curt and rushed. No upgrade discount or anything whatsoever offered for my trouble. No assistance offered with moving my belongings from one floor to another. In the subsequent two days my keys stopped working on three separate occasions. Each time I had to wait in a lengthy line to get them re-activated. Each time the staff was unfriendly and in no case did anyone apologize for this. They also have an electronic key option which worked only for the first day of my trip and then ceased working at all the remainder of the stay. When mentioned to staff they shrugged this off and indicated it is a common issue. At one point I accidentally went into a room two doors down from mine and found that my electronic key would open that door! Fortunately the guests in the room had the metal interior lock on so I did not walk in on them. Clearly the security situation / key situation is very poor. After that occurred I was very concerned about leaving valuables in my room with the knowledge that other guests might be able to key into it. Lines are often long to get any human interaction at this property so I sunk quite a bit of time into dealing with all these issues. They clearly are focused on minimizing costs by having extremely few staff/ actual humans that one can speak to. On one occasion I tried to call the front desk and no one answered. At check out they try to get every cent they can by charging $25 to extend check out to 1 PM. Overall a very negative experience. Another guest in my party checked into their room and found it had not been cleaned at all since the departure of the previous guests. With so many good options on the strip I would highly recommend taking your business elsewhere.
50,We always choose Park MGM especially when bringing my kids down for concerts. It's smoke free and close to TMobile Arena the concert hall at Park MGM as well as the MGM Garden. Before we usually eat at Eataly or Lala Noodle. It's close to everything so you can just be there in a minute we don't usually Uber anywhere.
50,Great hotel. Easy check in and out. Super clean room. Staff was friendly and location was great. Will come back later this year and bring friends. Restaurants were amazing as well. Very satisfied with my stay.
10,Room was gross and dirty and the towels were stained. The shower leaks water onto the floor so there’s a pool of water when you step out. AC unit constantly made noise that woke us up several times. Room looked very outdated and did not have a fridge. Check in process was horrible. They said it would be a wait so I went walking around and didn’t realize that about three minutes after I tried to check in they sent me a text saying my room was ready. I asked for a late check out because I am a world of Hyatt customer and was told yes but later that night when I made sure I was given 2pm they told me they can’t do that. I was also charged a resort fee even though I used a reward night which has never happened at any other hotel. Like most things in Vegas it feels like I was scammed. Will never return to this property again.
50,It’s simple but wonderful. It has everything you need at a great price. Eataly La La noodle Best Friend three pools small smoke free casino walk to Aria and connected to the tram to Crystals/Bellagio. I wish it had a coffee maker in the room but that’s my only complaint!
50,If you are a non-smoker this is literally the only place to stay in Vegas. This trip was a test for us to see if we were ready to do a big trip again. Indeed we could walk everywhere we wanted to go and the tram is close enough to get you everywhere else. Bavette's is fabulous for dinner. Best mattresses ever. We can't wait to go back.
40,Great location. Excellent restaurant selection. LaLa Noodles!! Room was outdated and bed/pillows a little uncomfortable. We saw Bruno Mars in concert there…all was right in my world!! What a performance
50,The staff was friendly and helpful. They made check in easy. The doorman was very personable and made sure we were good. The cleaning staff were very friendly including the casino floor staff. They made you feel at home by interacting with even though it was small talk.
10,This was my first time staying at a hotel. I did not have the best experience. My key card on my phone was not working well room was warm and some what dirty. And I was also charged $144.22 after checking in even though I had already paid for the room months before which I was only charged $111.11 (I thought this was the total bill for the room) but I guess not.
50,Park MGM’s my new go to hotel in Las Vegas.  Real nice location and I love that the entire hotel’s non smoking including their casino.    As a Hyatt Globalist they match my status with the MGM Rewards so I get to enjoy the perks of being a MGM Gold that includes free parking waive resort fees room upgrade to strip view room / Stay Well Rooms which by the way I love the most.    After a walk along the strip I always go and enjoy their hot tub/ jacuzzi which opens at 9am (though I wish it stays open late like 8/9 ish)    Breakfast @ Primrose good and friendly service.    Would love to stay here over and over again when visiting in Las Vegas.
50,Check in process was through the app everything worked well with the electronic key our room was nice and clean the staff was really friendly Silk Sonic concert was in this hotel that’s why we checked in here. Overall we had a great experience. I just wish there were more vegan options in the hotel. Although Aria was connecting to the hotel and you don’t even have to exit the building and there we ate at Din Tai Fung which had excellent vegan options
30,No mini-fridge in room. Vending machine on our floor was not working and I couldn't go to another floor for beverages because of room key programming on elevator. Hallways were dimly lit with yellow lighting that was eerily reminiscent of horror movies. Sliding barn door to the bathroom was inconvenient and unnecessary. Walls were thin and I could hear every sound in the hall and from the next room where lucky me - the dude never left his room was always on his phone and spoke very loudly.
10,They have very confusing menu because they try to make it fancy by using some Italian word’s mixed with English. Stupid! Portions are small and over priced. Wine is really overpriced and the restaurant is open to the mall with wooden benches to sit on. Not fancy so why the high prices? Just don’t go here
50,This is a fantastic property! Non smoking great food great pools great rooms and customer service! We especially love Rosemary our favorite blackjack dealer. We look forward to seeing her every time we’re there. We almost always choose ParkMGM and will keep coming back year after year! Eataly Bavette’s Primrose and the Nomad Bar are all fantastic places to dine.
50,Park MGM Las Vegas provides excellent customer service!!! Rooms were clean and comfortable. We stayed in Nighthawk Suite. We will definitely be staying there for our son’s 30th birthday celebration!!!
50,As I was traveling with a cancer survivor we were pleased to find this resort a smoke free facility. Everyone was friendly our room was clean the restaurants awesome and the casino lots of fun. We checked in to see Silk Sonic but enjoyed all the other aspects of our stay as well.
30,Room was ok and beds were very comfortable and clean. No complaints there. But it appeared tired and dark. There were few amenities...no coffee maker in the room and no extra bath and lotions. A built in bench along the window wall was the only seating and there was a rather old round table near. A small tray was affixed to the wall and contained 1 battle of water and two other bottles of which I cannot recall the contents. It also contained 3 bags of snacks. The sign on the tray said you could select anything and when so many seconds went by the sensor in the tray would deem you bought the item and your room would be charged. A positive was easy access to taxis and drop-offs because the hotel was off the strip and in back of the MGM Grand.
50,First time staying at the Park and will definitely be back! The staff were all so friendly and helpful the amenities were great and the rooms were clean and comfortable. We were there for 3 nights and didn't want to leave!
50,This hotel was great with location and service was exceptional. Overall our stay was decent and the service was quick and persistent. I recommend this hotel if you’re looking for decent price and perfect strip location.
50,Enjoy the size of this resort along with the most important new aspect smoke free casino and resort. Food availability has been a favorite and access to all things Vegas is excellent as most are within walking distance of the resort.
50,This hotel had everything we needed and more. The access to everything on the strip was prime and having so much inside was the icing on the cake! Eataly was amazing casino was so clean and we didn't have to leave our hotel if we didn't want to because it had everything we needed inside! Only complaint is no mini fridge.
40,I like this location best since you can charge to your bill at all MGM Locations & at least 5 casinos each with 5-10+ restaurants.-the tram makes this easy so super location & great restaurant choices.
40,I liked the location of Park MGM. The pool was not overcrowded and a calm atmosphere. The cleanliness of the rooms was slightly questionable and the layout was odd and we could hear the people next to us just simply talking. However the bed was super comfortable and it was spacious. It was super easy to navigate and get from place to place without getting lost. I loved that it is completely smoke free and overall just a chill atmosphere.
40,We traveled with 3 couples from Canada. We had stayed here before but found Park MGM rooms to be mediocre booze watered down slow drink service no breakfast places no late snack places. Very Expensive now too compared to 2 years ago! Crazy expensive to eat and drink!!
50,Came to Vegas for my best friend’s graduation party. Was only staying in town for a day and honestly the fact that I had no issues checking in or out was amazing. Would have walked the strip but I was completely tired from the drive
40,Nice hotel. I would stay again. FOOOD!! The food is legit. Every restaurant we ate was top notch. Rooms are nice and clean with modern technology. Need to add fridges in rooms. The biggest sell was the smoke free casino
50,Second time staying at the Park and we'd come back again. You don't know the importance of a non-smoking hotel until you stay in one. Rooms and grounds were clean great beds good food and decent slots. Staff was courteous and helpful.
50,Great view from the nightingale suite. The hotel is less than 10m away from everything not on the strip. Shops and stores and souvenirs are located across the street. The restaurants in the hotel are amazing. No refrigerator so plan your meals appropriately. Other than that we had a great time.
50,Everything was top notch! The staff throughly was phenomenal. Friendly knowledgeable & helpful. It is a smoke free casino as well so no smoke smell! The Eataly was off the charts delicious foods. You will not be disappointed!
10,ive had better sleep in a motel six than at park mgm. i will say the reps are all terrific but the property falls short. rooms are gaudy; like 1950 whore houses. weird paintings on the wall. air conditioner announces its arrival by blowing a horn every time it is about to start. Even during the time you may want to sleep! just say no
50,Great weekend great accommodations. Can't wait for my next weekend adventure. Hotel room was large and comfortable. Room service was prompt. Restaurants at hotel exceptional. Looking forward to returning to the Park MGM.
50,Epic. Exceptional. Exactly what we wanted. Close to strip Eataly was delicious and On The Record was the Spot to be After Hours. And the pillows and bedding are buttery soft and you just melt into them! Wish I could’ve taken a pillow home
40,The hotel itself is nice. For the most part most of the staff are extremely helpful. Be prepared at checkin to pay a refundable $100 per night for incidentals…all restaurants close by 11:00pm except for a diner type grill with a menu of about 4-5 items.
30,Smoke free is the best quality they have casino feels much cleaner because of that. Average rooms nothing special. Maybe if my king room wasn't given away before I checked in I would feel differently. They did find a queen room. I noticed there were other people having simple check in problems that should've never happened to them either.
30,We had a few issues one was checking in. Two was we asked in advance for joining rooms or rooms close to each other. Three the cleanliness of the rooms were poor. The rooms wasn’t vacuum and some trash was left behind. Asked to have it cleaned in the morning and wasn’t done til after dinner.
10,The service is poor to say the least post COVID has change customer service for ever the rooms are small they smell you can hear everything next door . Staff is untrained and not friendly at all do not care nor need your business.
50,Me husband and I spent our one year anniversary with complimentary rooms. There was much to do. I gambled he relaxed. The dining choices at Park MGM are incredible. Early food court and LaLa Noodle was our favorite. There was no reason to go to other hotels other than you pass time. Overall a terrific experience.
20,You don’t get what you pay for. No coffee maker no fridge. Basic room with a bed and cranky AC. Windows are paper thin even on the 8th floor you could hear a motorcycle idling at the stop sign. Monte Carlo was a better hotel before MGM took over. Digital key didn’t work with elevator or parkade. Was a loyal Monte Carlo patron (4 stays) will never stay here again.
30,Room was small and very basic. No refrigerator or microwave. Room clean dined at 2 hotel restaurants and it was ok. The Eataly food court was good. Good Location on the strip. Casino is smoke free which was nice.
50,Great room awesome services avaible just in the hotel. Had a wonderful time at the Silk Sonic show. Definitely coming back for a longer stay to experience more that Vegas offers to us. The hotel had very friendly staff and was always lending a hand when needed
50,Smoke free resort makes a big difference. Other nicer and more expensive hotels on the strip smells of cigarette smoke. Clean rooms gaming floor restaurants. Good walking distance from mores restaurants and shopping stores.
40,The hotel is very very nice. The disappointment came when we saw our room felt didn’t match our expectations as to what hotel looked like and price we paid. Very dark furniture was depressing looking.
50,The hotel was very clean and everyone was helpful and friendly. Location of the hotel is perfect. Plenty in places to eat inside and within walking distance of the hotel along with plenty of shopping.
10,Was completely unacceptable to be a assigned a room with flooded wet carpet only to be reassigned to another floor with flooded wet hallway carpet and musty smells. HOW could these rooms be made available to guests???
40,Everything was great. We liked the non smoking policy throughout the facility including the casino. We like the newly designed food court section high quality food but wish the prices would be a little less. The only draw-back and hence a 4 instead of a 5 ranking is that the bedding is TOO SOFT.
10,I certainly understand and respect travel on a budget but this was ridiculous. If I had been traveling with more than 1 person in my party they would have no where to sit in the room except on the bed. No dresser no coffee pot no mini fridge. This was very very very basic. If you come to Vegas to only use a room for sleep and shower I would not even recommend Park MGM.
50,Great hotel? Great staff very friendly and kind!! Would return back many times over! Good was excellent and great service. The only thing I would work on was drink staff took forever to get a drink. It took twice as long to get it was you ordered it.
50,When you’re ask how will you be paying should be a question for the staff to ask the customer so they’ll know if it’s covered by comp  card or cash so We know what options we have! Overall the stay & hotel is beautiful well maintained but the Starbucks staff needs a lil bit more enthusiasm don’t seem happy at there job!
10,"When you think of going to the ""park"" you think of pleasant things and sunny skies. The Park MGM is a dark hotel with bleak hallways and rooms that are barely clean enough and is after one complains about the trash left by a previous occupant. Of course the lack of hot water in one of our rooms did not add to the ambience."
50,First time using Park MGM but not first MGM property staying in it was worth the stay. I will use the property again soon in September. Definitely recommend booking your stay at Park  MGM. Great Job MGM
50,The place was Very clean love the fact that it’s non smoking! Would like to see a few more food establishments! Very nice peaceful stay! Location is perfect was able to walk to the other casinos that I wanted to visit!!
50,Great accommodations. Room was clean and staff very friendly and helpful. Used new keyless entry which was a little learning curve at first. Enjoyed smoke free casino. Liked that the rail system was so close and made travel to other locations easier. Clear uber designated area.
50,My husband and I stayed here for a long weekend and would definitely go back. The pools are very nice lots of loungers were available throughout the day sun and shade options servers and bartenders were great. Best pool in Vegas we've stayed at.    Rooms are nothing fancy but clean and comfortable.Very easy access from rooms to rest of the hotel and casino. Doesn't take a ton of time to get from the room out to the Strip.    There were so many bars and places to eat inside this resort alone we almost didnt go anywhere else. Eataly is awesome with so many options.    Could not recommend this place more!
40,I loved staying at this 100% smoke free hotel and casino. Staff was very accommodating making my stay more enjoyable. Comfortable room but surprisingly didn’t have an alarm clock. Great location on the strip!
40,My room had a nice view. The staff was great. They should work on getting microwaves on the floor or somewhere nearby for the guests. My family enjoyed our trip & the time we spent together. Vegas is definitely the city that never sleeps!
50,We had a wonderful experience at the Park MGM. The location is excellent with easy access to a variety of entertainment options. The casino is smoke free which I really appreciate. The restaurants are varied and Eataly is a nice option. Definitely will stay here again.
50,Excellent service. My friend was able to check in early. Worked out great. Staff and room were excellent. Easy to get in and out of the hotel. Very clean. Great location on the strip to walk to most attractions
40,The price is unbeatable comparing to others in the same location. The hotel is good but not fancy like the ones around it but very comfortable. It has some good Italian foods and the breakfast is really good.
50,The best part of this place is when you get off the elevator you don’t walk into a wall of smoke. There is a Starbucks in the hotel but walk through the Casino to Eataly. Better food and Better espresso
30,The casino is non-smoking which is very refreshing. The restaurants Bavette's Steak House was excellent. Eataly was excellent.  The room was small and cheap. Honestly equivalent to a Motel 6 room or worse. I'm a higher player in the casino and I've never been given such a lousy room. I don't know what the typical customer gets.
50,Everything was excellent. The staff was great. The restaurant Primrose was exceptional along with the service. The housekeeping went far and beyond great service. The bell serv8ce was excellent. No complaints at all.
10,"I was a regular in Las Vegas and would play craps regularly.I LOVED Las Vegas and raved about it but NO MORE.  Not being in Las Vegas due to moving and the Covid for three years I happen to be now regularly visiting Las Vegas due to my pool competitions at least two-three times a year. This was my first of many visits but my last to your properties!  I was invited for most of my stay at the MGM. And when invited I always play a lot at my host hotel and within their properties. But after I saw that MGM tables are $25. I didn't care to play. I am NOT going to play at a $25 table and watch hundreds of my money be swept away on a roll of the dice. That is just outrageous!! And on top of that burn wait an hour for a cocktail!! Rarely did I find a $15 and never a $10-even on graveyard.  ATTITUDES. I am gambling my money and I have to get a ""baditude"" from your dealers?? An Asian woman refusing to take my bet BEFORE dice were even given to roller. Her excuse was she didn't want to take a chance chipping her nail?? Bad attitudes in general-really rude behavior. This was at other casinos.  For the most part I found the staff friendly at the Park MGM but this situation at the Park MGM really irritated me at your hotel--It was late in the night I was at the table by myself with just men playing. A new bank was coming in and they were busy counting it. I tipped the dealers and wanted to color up but they were preoccupied with counting the new bank that came in so not wanting to wait I gathered my chips and started to walk away. The floor manager--tall black guy with glasses chased me and yelled at me that he wanted me to ""color up"" I said I was gong to another table or cashing out. Then he demanded (in front of everyone watching) and said ""We need to keep the money on the table'"" ABSOLUTE LIE. It was SO UNPROFESSIONAL. And the entire table turned around and was watching this. I didn't go back purposely. I know you want to keep track of what I lost/won but would he have done that with a man??? I seriously doubt it!! He went to control and intimidate a woman and it most definitely back-fired!! I was thinking of going to another table (which I did but shouldn't have). I have NEVER been treated like that when walking away from a table with chips. Why should I wait to color up and then go to another table and break it down?? Why should I wait to cash out-if I want to?  Ignored or not being forced to wait or not I have every right to walk away if I want."
50,Everyone was very helpful and kind. The maids were exceptionally conciseness.    I had to have my television looked at twice because of problems with the remote. The second time it was finally resolved. Again the technicians were very concerned about my satisfaction while being quite patient with me.
20,I traveled to Vegas for the first time with my two minor children and chose Park MGM because of the pools and the smoke-free hotel. Upon check-in to my room the blind to the window was broken. When notifying the front desk the credited my account $75 and moved us to another room. When we entered the second room we found a dirty earplug and garbage in the room. It was almost as if the room was already occupied or not cleaned after the previous occupant. We called the front desk again and was given another $50 credit. The following day while eating at an in-house restaurant I was advised that my room number was not what they had in the system. They had changed our room the night before and didn’t tell us. So we had to repack our items again and move rooms. On the day we checked out we found they failed to properly credit our account what they had previous advised and had to work with a supervisor to obtain the credit that was previously promised. So frustrating and disappointing!
40,Wish this place came with a fridge and also wished the bathroom had a lock. We also ran into an issue at check out where we were being charged for refreshment that we never ordered or touched from the weighted vending stand. Waiting to get that resolved.
40,my trips to Park are always very nice.. i love the accomodations and the non smoking.. the food is great and I love in room dining!The employees are super nice and helpful. I will continue to stay at Park as long as adm. is compatable.. Love it!
50,Wonderful … but I wished I would have know that if your staying at the hotel you received a discount on things purchased at the hotel only to find out that I asked after a purchase to be told I had to ask for it up front …
50,NONSMOKING is a huge plus for those of us not wanting the smell and smoke. The pool area is one of the more comfortable relaxing of any resort on the Strip. Easy access to the tram to Bellagio and the Eately food section offers good variety. The sports book is not over the top but offers space for small parties.
50,As always my family and I love coming to park MGM all the staff is amazing. The dealers are always nice respectful and sometimes goofy which makes the games fun to play. I love to laugh and park MGM never fails.
50,Everything was so great the room was great we had a wonderful View staff was so helpful in checking us in went to see Lady Gaga in concert and it was phenomenal our whole stay here here was off the charts and I am looking so forward to going back again
50,A non-smoking gem! Clean and spacious rooms. Location is incredible with doorstep access to T-Mobile Arena. Good food options throughout but the options at “Eataly” are fantastic! My new go-to hotel when in Vegas.
50,We always enjoy The Park....the pools convenient location is great....our only issue is the limited availability and long lines for a quick coffee to get the day going. The fact that the hotel is smoke free is a terrific.
50,The only casino on the strip that is completely Non-Smoking! Love it! Great place great rooms great food amazing theatre and entertainment. Not a large mega-casino but quaint and a bit intimate which makes you feel even more special than you are. Why would you go anyplace else?
50,We really enjoyed our stay at Park MGM. It was a girls weekend and definitely met our needs. Easy app check in and check out. Room was perfect for what we needed. Very clean! We also enjoyed the food at Eataly and the service over all the hotel.
50,The hotel had very clean rooms very nice staff and smelled amazing. We asked for a room with a good view the staff members moved us to a higher floor with a beautiful view. I highly recommend staying here.
50,Loved staying here for my first ever trip to Vegas! Definitely more of a business hotel everyone I saw was dressed up in suits/nice dresses BUT I wasn’t frowned upon for wearing shorts/tank top there. Perfect distance from everything.. Dennys M&M store Coca~Cola store Walgreens right across the street! Eat at Eatly inside great food for breakfast/lunch/dinner! Very safe hotel couldn’t access rooms without a keycard to elevator which eased my mind being in an unfamiliar big city!
50,You can't miss eating at Eataly a collection of restaurants. We had great slices of pizza. Rooms were very comfortable and clean. Never felt exposed to health issues. Staff cleans everything. Bathrooms had great spacious shower big enough for 2! Housekeeping was very friendly and helpful. We parked in the garage made our way towards the Front Desk were met by hotel staff before we reached the front desk and they checked us in quickly. Great stay.
40,Great restaurants bars and Dolby Live Theatre was beautiful. Casino is spacious. The only knock is the hallways on the floors is dark and not enough lighting. But the rooms are decent. Silk Sonic is a lead to bring guests to Park MGM so I notice a lot of buzz going around the hotel/casino/restaurants about them.
50,It liked that I didn’t have to smell smoke and it always smelled fresh. It was easy access to a lot of casinos and shops The stuff was very nice and you seen them everywhere to help you if you like Italian food this is great for you but I prefer the chicken place right outside of there
40,We chose the Park MGM for convenience as we were attending the Silk Sonic concert in the hotel. The room was fine not luxe but comfortable. The restaurants were surprisingly good - Bavette's Steakhouse was excellent as was Nomad Library. The hotel is on the smaller side which was a good thing not so much walking to get where you're going. The pool area was fine and drinks were good but expensive - but not enough servers and so-so food. All in all we had a good experience and happy we chose to base ourselves at Park MGM. Hotel had everything we needed for an enjoyable 3-4 day stay.
50,Love the location and the pool. Nice clean rooms and the casino is a great size. My wife and I stay here several times a year and have always had a great experience. The Eataly food court has some unique (and great) shops and restaurants.
30,Small casino with small gambling floor. I didn’t see any jackpots being paid out. Not that many table games. Small assortment of places to eat. Great location to walk to other casinos. Not bad value for what I paid to stay there.
40,The room was a little dusty and table was sticky. The ac in the room would not cool the room below mid 70s and even with blinds shut the room was still very warm. Other than the room I’d definitely recommend.
50,We went down for a nice post covid vacation. I made a mistake in booking so we didn't have reservations and it was a little unnerving when we arrived. The lady that checked us in helped us and we were able to get the same offer that I'd originally thought I'd booked with our MGM rewards. The pool was great the room setup was a little strange and random with a huge couch that served no purpose and a round table that just took up space.
50,Our stay for over the weekend was a very nice experience over all hotel cleanliness the smoke free hotel experience was also a plus. Rooms service was very good didn’t miss a day and cleaned up very well.
40,Friendly and courteous staff. Registration helped speed us to our room. Housekeeping kept our room clean and met our expectations    Placing sports bets were easy and staff was friendly.    Only challenge was the Rewards certificate was useless as the bar was closed.
30,"Stumbled upon the Italian based food court while walking the strip. Clean not too crowded (on a Saturday eve) and fun to check out all the options. Their effort to mimic an Italian piazza was not bad and were satisfied with the options although the bakery was closed (at dinner time?). Expect ""Strip"" prices -- $17 for a glass of low/medium end wine ?!?"
50,We really enjoyed this hotel. Comfortable rooms and beds. There is everything you could possibly need under one roof. Location is perfect with shopping right across LV Boulevard. There are alot of restaurants at the resort but our favorite was Eataly that had everything you could want.
40,We stay at Park about 90% of the time we are in Vegas. The location is fantastic the staff is very friendly there are great places to eat. WE love Bavettes the small bars around the casino and the coffee place is great.
50,This is the only nonsmoking casino on strip would never stay anyplace else. The rooms were very clean the only issue we had was water leaked below the shower door. There was a good variety of restaurants that we ate at and enjoyed.
50,Went with my son and husband for the weekend. Park MGM is my new favourite hotel in Vegas. So fantastic that it is smoke free. Very friendly and accommodating staff. Room was fantastic and super comfy bed. Can't wait to come back!
50,It was clean. The only staff we dealt with was the people working at the Eataly. They were all nice and accommodating. If I went back to Las a Vegas I’d stay there again. The only complaint I have is that there were no coffee pots on the room. I need coffee to get going in the morning without getting dressed to go downstairs.
30,Rooms and furniture need an upgrade. The staff is friendly but the amenities are below average compared to other properties. The value is very average. Mlife rewards should start kicking in more incentives to stay at these properties in their current condition.
50,Clean room very good food and drinks  hotel In great place all great restaurants around it plus inside the hotel have plenty of food and drink choices . Casino is very clean and smoke free so it’s great for non smoker
50,Park always strives to make my experience the best. I am extremely thankful for the staff and cleanliness of the hotel. I love that it's non smoking!! It's nice walking through the casino and being able to breathe!
50,Great rooms Great Servicethe only 100% smoke free casino on the strip!!! Easy access to casino or parking from the lobby. Very Clean. Our room was upgraded at no cost to a handicap suite. !!
50,Park MGM is located between New York New York and Aria hotel.  It is easy to go to Bellagio using the tram and short walking distance to Aria and Crystal. There is Dolby theater in the facility where Silk Sonic concert was on. And the ride share station is right out of the building and it takes only 5mins from the rooms.
50,Went there for a concert and will definitely be back. The hotel was nice and smoke free the food options were great and you’re right in the middle of everything on the strip. Had such a wonderful time.
50,Park MGM is ideally located to access Las Vegas strip. We attended 2 shows and it was easy to travel to 2 other hotels to enjoy those events. Rooms / beds very comfortable & clean. No mini fridge or robes included with room rate. LOVE the smoke free environment! Shout out to Ru - poolside and Mark - Primrose Restaurant outstanding service from both! We would stay again :)
50,This hotel has so many wonderful food drink and entertainment options - along with a great pool area. I have been in the hotel business and their staff is the best I have ever encountered. From security to front desk - they couldn’t be more pleasant. Love that the hotel is completely non-smoking. We had an exceptional stay.
50,Took my daughter to see Lady Gaga. It was her first time in Las Vegas. We toured other hotels and Park was her favorite by far. The layout the feel restaurants and especially the guests. All around a perfect stay.
50,Park MGM is a great stay for many reasons. Top three are the people the location and the vibes.    The staff is always smiling and helpful.    It’s close to Aria Eataly and Crystals.    The club entrance is downstairs and you should definitely check it out.
50,I had a great experience at park mgm. Slots seemed to really be in your favor and the whole team worked very hard to provide excellent customer service. Miss Deleon was a blast and made the experience fun and informational. Erin and John also provided awesome customer service for all bookings and activities to ensure the full benefits of my mgm rewards. Looking forward to my next trip!!
50,This non-smoking casino/hotel is an Asthmatic’s dream. So nice and so worth it!  The tram to other hotels is very convenient the choices for dining look delicious and the on-site Starbucks was great! I’d stay again!
40,This was first time since 2015 it has been awhile so much has changed and much remained the same I had a nice time this hotel is in a nice place lots of action and the shows are wonderful and close by
30,No refrigerator or mini bar? Room was hot and stuffy when we checked in. Not super clean in room. Dust and sticky remnants on sill by window seat. Also restaurants close and no 24 hour room service or restaurant? Service was good at restaurants. Eataly was the highlight ofnthe place!
50,The location amenities and friendly/professional personnel. Also the convenience of presenting top musical talent at the Dolby Live within the resort. We all enjoyed the Italian marketplace - Eataly!
50,First time visiting this hotel but excellent staff and hotel. Loved that the hotel was right outside the T Mobile Arena. Loved the service of not needing to wait in line for room. Love the security of needing your room key to enter elevator to your floors . I Would recommend and come back again
30,Rooms are pricey for what they are. Very basic with none of the amenities you would expect in a basic (but pricey) room (e.g. fridge coffee microwave etc.). The casino is probably the worst on the strip based on my personal preference. Low energy tight slots limited variety in games.
20,The check in process was fairly seemless. Front desk person checking us in wasn't as friendly as I would have expected but it was busy so she did her job. Walking down hallway to room was kind of scary with the poor lighting. Perhaps it was dimly lit to avoid any extra attention to the stained carpeting? Upon entering our room we were met with decor we were not particularly fond of. Maybe that part is a matter of personal choice. However the same weird odor from the hallway followed us into the room and never went away. Not sure what that was all about. Loved the idea of the facility being smoke free but by then it all just added up to a very disappointing experience and knew we could not stay. We promptly went back to the front desk and checked out. Thankfully we were able to secure other accommodations that were just perfect for us. Heard good things about the premises but we weren't able to see for ourselves. If carpets and decor are replaced and something done about the odor we may try again another time.
40,Great restaurants Etaly and Friends easy access to Dolby theater which is the best place to see a show saw Silk Sonic it was amazing. good casino floor clean but lacked drink service. Nice pool area with very good service.
30,Out of 4 nights only 1 night was acceptable for housekeeping from a housekeeper named Secret. Nor emptying garbage not leaving clean glasses and leaving dirty ones and not leaving clean washcloths is a problem. Couldn't reach bell service for bags.
30,ParkMGM smoke free ✅. Good location. Check in all right. Wanted you to use automated check could get it to work( could have been me). Restaurants very good service and food was very good. Rooms were not cleaned well and furniture was worn. Very drab. Felt like something was missing. No desk. Table not near outlets.  Would return.
10,1. There was no hot water in the showers and after 4 attempts to fix this problem still wasn’t fixed.  2. rooms were dark and cave like  3. trash and dirty rooms when first checked in  4. missing clothes from room with no reimbursement
50,This was our 5th time staying here. We love that no smoking is allowed on property. The air is fresh smelling throughout the hotel and casino! The staff is helpful and checking in and out is a breeze.
50,The rooms and amenities were excellent and staff was friendly and helpful. Shower pressure and bed/pillow comfort was next level. I had 10 people with me and was able to get the exact rooms we wanted. Everyone in our group was pleased. Gorgeous property and very accessible... would definitely stay again!
40,Lovely hotel room decorated really beautifully with a great view. Pool was nice if very busy that weekend. Food in the hotel was expensive as is much of Vegas. But was was very tasty in spite of the price. However there seemed to be hidden costs at every step of the process so the original per night price ended up being totally inaccurate. I wish I had been quoted the actual per night price initially. I would have been just as likely to book and I wouldn't have felt like I was decieved.
50,Wonderful staff throughout good dining options lots of pool space but the best part is the property is nonsmoking! The Dolby theater is beautiful! We will definitely stay here again and recommend to anyone visiting Vegas!
50,Non-smoking great staff; always had staff available in the casino. Best hotels shower I can remember slept very well and great food in and near the hotel. It is in the center of everything. Overall Las Vegas can be expensive. This hotel is a better value for what we received. We had such a good time; we are planning our next trip to the Park MGM. To stay somewhere else would be a disappointment.
40,From the time we checked in the staff and service was excellent. Everyone was friendly and helpful. The stay was amazing and the hotel was clean and very much in the middle of everything. This is definitely a place for me to visit again.
20,Room is not worth the price Motel 6 is finer than this room No refrigerator in the room guest services rude and obnoxious. When we asked to upgrade to a better room we were told to cancel our booking and go somewhere else.
50,My wife and I really enjoyed our stay at Park MGM. The hotel rooms were clean hotel was clean great access to the strip and lots of places to eat in the hotel. The next time I travel to Las Vegas this will be our choice to stay.
30,Pros: non smoking hotel!!! Excellent restaurants and many food choices. Casino is large and also smoke free! They have lots of fun bars with live music! Very friendly staff. Great location on strip.  Cons: AC doesn’t work well and auto shuts off after a very short amount of time. No fridge so it’s hard to keep anything cold. They also do not offer any free waters at all! No fan or ventilation in bathroom and the bathroom door is a sliding door that also is used for the closet. So you need to chose between going in the closet of bathroom. It is also not private due to the type of door. There is just a stand up shower with very minimal space in bathroom.
50,Had a good time and the place was at a good location for a good price. Would stay again especially for a fight or a raiders game.    Had the stay well so I enjoyed the memory foam bed and the oxygen being pumped in the room
20,I so wanted to like this resort but ... I felt nickel and dimed ( but that is probably the whole strip ). The halls were too long. Parents watch your kids in the room. There was a tray of goodies (way overpriced) that were pressure sensitive. I can see a small child innocently pick up a bag of jelly beans thinking that they're free. The closet and bathroom share 1 door that is on rollers. Either the bathroom is closed or the closet is closed but not both. When you slide open the door from the bathroom you could easily injure a person standing in or near the closet. Looks like a dangerous setup. In fact my foot got bumped by the door. Luckily my wife has a delicate way about her and I was not injured. The noise level in some restaurants stifles conversation and probably tries to hurry people along. Adjoining rooms also have the added benefit of being able to participate in your neighbor's conversation if you so choose. Sorry MGM - I was not impressed.
40,A friend and I were spending a few days in Vegas and my travel agent recommended Park MGM since nonsmoking was a priority. This hotel does not allow smoking anywhere in the property - including the casinos. As someone allergic to smoke this was huge.    The room itself was comfortable enough. The beds are incredibly low (it came up to my knee). The safe is small; it couldn't fit a laptop if you wanted it to. We weren't there long enough so just skipped housekeeping for the couple nights we were there. The room was clean; it just seemed a little tired.    If you have a tree nut allergy please be aware the hotel toiletries are almond and you will want to bring your own including hand soap.    The restaurants we ate at (La La Noodles & Primrose) were great. Friendly service and the food was good. The cannoli/dessert place in Eatly was not great.    All of the Park MGM employees we came in contact with were very helpful and friendly. My friend and I both agreed that this would be our first choice when we stay in Vegas.
50,The Park MGM was a great hotel selection for my first stay in Las Vegas. The primary selling point of the hotel is that it is non-smoking as well as the casino in it. Rooms are nice and large enough that you don't feel boxed in like a New York hotel. The only downside is that the walls are very thin. I could hear conversations next door and noises outside the room. Staff was all very friendly and helpful. I like the intimate feel of the casino you didn't feel overwhelmed trying to navigate through it.
50,We were in Vegas for two nights as part of our honeymoon road trip from England and this leg 9f the trip also happened to cover my 30th birthday! We were given a complimentary upgrade to one of their Wellness Rooms in the Nomad section of the hotel and while it wouldn't be something I'd ordinarily think to opt for the aromatherapy and memory foam mattress were a great touch and much appreciated after a couple of busy days exploring the strip!    The hotel is in a great location for exploring the strip from top to bottom and coming back to the Park MGM you really notice how much more modern and clean it is in comparison to some of the other hotels and casinos. We had some lovely meals at Eataly and Best Friend we just wish that Off The Record had been open on the days we were there (a Monday and Tuesday) as it looked really cool! If we ever find ourselves back in Vegas this is where we'll stay.
50,We have stayed at Park MGM 3 times and will definitely stay there again. They have great restaurants very comfortable rooms and friendly staff. The location couldn’t be better with access to the monorail to Aria and Bellagio as well as the monorail that runs from MGM Grand down to the Convention Center. Access to most of the hotels/casinos on the strip.
50,This was my first stay at the Park MGM and I will definitely return. This is the only hotel and casino on the Las Vegas strip that is smoke-free which was amazing. The rooms are updated and very comfortable and the facilities are immaculately clean and decorated very well. The staff are very friendly and helpful. There are a lot of performers that perform regularly at this hotel such as Bruno Mars and Usher. I highly recommend staying at the park MGM.
50,This hotel/casino was one of the cleanest and had the most friendliest staffs I have ever stayed in in a long time. Eataly had plenty of options for food. Food was excellent. If you plan on staying here I recommend making a reservation for Babette’s Steak House in advance. I tried to get in and the earliest I could get in was a week after I left.
40,great location on the strip total non-smoking hotel & casino nice comfortable rooms lots of good variety of food places and slot machines or table games if you prefer. Nice pools with full-service food & drinks right at the pools
50,Had a great stay at Park MGM. Clean room right on the strip and close to everything. Was pleased with the casino floor and dinning experience. I would recommend to all my friends and family. Not to mention the tram makes going from casino to casino easy.
10,Very expensive non-frills hotel. The room space was fine but the bathroom was tiny. There were no towel racks to hang hand towels and washcloths and the counter space was nonexistent. My wife and I each have a toiletry case and both would not fit on the counter. I will never go back to this hotel.
50,Excellent hotel. Enjoyed the All-Digital experience from the check in to the digital keys for the room. Fast and easy way to avoid lines in person checkin or staff interaction. Will definitely be planning another stay.
50,Rooms seem newer. Very clean. Primrose cafe excellent. The non-smoking casino was the biggest draw for me. I am spoiled now and only want to go to non-smoking. Blackjack was meh at mostly 6/5 but there was one 3/2 game at $25 minimum. Needs more bar top machines. Pool was just ok. Location is perfect. Easy access to South strip CVS Target for water etc. Easy to get Uber. They offer Free tram to Bellagio and Aria.
40,Had a great stay at this hotel even though had a few discrepancies here and there. Hotel staff was a great help during they stay and worked diligently to fix any issues I found. Casino and eatery was fantastic. I would stay here again even though I had a few issues upon arrival.
50,This hotel is very nice I hear it’s the only hotel with no smoking. The room is not huge but not small either. This hotel has 3 pools that were all open at the same time the pools close at 7 I find that’s early. I enjoyed my time here I do recommend the hotel overall. You get a credit card type room key that mine kept not working and I had to keep goito the desk to get reactivated. The cleaning lady came in the morning we were in the room she said she would be back but never came back. Place is pricey as all places on strip so bring $$
50,The location amenities and value are worth the stay. The pool and fitnesses area are 10+. The rooms offer great views with plenty of space for all needs. The conference rooms are very nice and conveniently located to the guest rooms.
50,Loved the room cleanliness and modern. Had a great view easy access to elevators. Staff was very helpful friendly and the check in time went very smooth. We will certainly return to this hotel next time we visit.
20,Furniture in the room was used and old felt like a roadside motel. the room was humid and smelt like it. Bed was comfortable .    We werent told upon check in that we needed to ask for housekeeping services so every morning i would run to housekeepers with my wet towels in order to exhange them for new ones.    Common areas and nice and clean and we appreciated that the casino was non-smoking.
30,Eately was fun. Otherwise not much open for lunch. Primrose was tasty. The hostesses are not flexible though. Seems to be the case at most restaurants when you are waiting for someone from your party to arrive. Nomad bar was great. Hotel room was small outdated no coffee makers no fridge. Staff seems unhappy.
40,This is a very nice hotel. They have an excellent casino. This is just for me I thought the beds was a little too low. The rooms are very nice. I think they should have some lower table limits. T e minimum was 15.00.
50,Beautiful hotel and concert venue with Dolby Live. Highly recommend you have your Vegas stop right here. The staff was beyond helpful. The rooms were perfect. Restaurants are some of the best on the strip.
50,Modern look all around. Room set up was different then the rest. Feels like being home. The restroom/shower was the best part of it. Extremely clean and very spacious. The staff extremely attentive no matter where you are. Everyone is eager to help out…
40,They have very few video poker machines of the type I chose to play. They may not have liked my play for some reason because things changed. I ended up playing at other casinos where the game was enjoyable.
20,The only good thing here is a smoke free environment and the Eataly food corridor. Staff is nice but so not follow through. Room is low quality small and it took 4 request to get my room cleaned. Not sure I would stay here again.
50,We went to see Lady Gaga at the Dolby Live theater on-site. This hotel is clean smoke-free throughout with amazing restaurants. Poolside service was amazing and you must eat at Best Friend. We will be back!
30,Friendly staff great dining. Room was not good for the price. Lived out of our suitcases cause there’s no drawers and only a small wardrobe. Good thing we don’t spend much time in the room cause it wasn’t nice.
50,Great place to stay and near all the action.  The Park MGM located right beside the T-Mobile arena is now a smoke free resort.  Rooms are very clean and neat with on site restaurants bars and Eataly food court will keep you never wanting more.  Lady GaGa show was amazing she really is a great entertainer.
50,A wonderful place to come home to while having a great time in Las Vegas. We went there to celebrate my friend’s birthday. This was her very first time in Las Vegas. Everyone at the hotel made her feel very special. She loved every minute of our stay.
20,Room not clean at arrival. Very dimly lit hallways. Digital key app fail mid stay required me to go get a key at front desk. Ok stay and great location. I was expecting more and will not plan to return
50,Had a fantastic time. Room was clean beautiful and comfortable. Staff are friendly and helpful. Great location on the strip and convenience stores were very conveniently located. Would return to the Park MGM again!
30,I was disappointed with the small size of the King bed room. The closet was very small and I had to use the sofa to place my suit average sized suitcase. Parking is $15 per night but should be free for hotel guests. There is no shortage of parking on the Las Vegas strip like other major destinations.
50,Amazing staff. Lovely room. Beautiful Pool!!! Easy to get to other areas trams and such. The pool area on the roof top was very relaxing! Great drinks! The casino is fantastic and smoke free! We had quick and easy check in.
50,I love that it is smoke free. Front desk staff is extremely friendly and helpful even at 2 in the morning. The hotel is much smaller and convenient compared to the other larger hotels on the strip.
50,Excellent stay great property easy and manageable. Came in for the night to see Gaga and it couldn't have been a better trip. The show was incredible Gaga surpassed expectations - the Dolby Live theater on site is a great venue. Bed was comfortable. Eataly is great.
30,Make sure your side passage door is locked or your neighbor may enter at 1am like the did for us. Management response was sorry. But that happens. Not acceptable. Remember when they'd comp you something? Ticket for a drink?
50,Clean fresh casino as smoking is not allowed. LOVED seeing Lady Gaga’s show and the little museum of her costumes. Best show I’ve ever seen! Joel was very nice with everything one could want. Especially great food in restaurants.
20,Paid extra for a suite and was put in a large dated suite right next to the elevators. Constant noise. At one point there was a ringing noise coming from one of the elevators that kept me up all night. I complained to the front desk. Nothing was done. No offer to comp the upgrade or move to a better location. Very disappointed with this part of our stay. Otherwise the smoke free environment of the entire resort and casino was very welcome.
50,Park MGM was a quality experience. It is smoke free and very nicely appointed. The pools are fabulous and the gaming floor spacious. Access to other properties and ride shares was very convenient. Eataly was our favorite place to catch a meal.
50,smoke free!! nuff said. Rooms are great super clean and very modern and very cool. Staff is super friendly and it was an overall great experience. Check in and parking was super easy and it was a breeze.
50,Loved the non-smoking resort and casino! There was a great selection of food. The House of Gaga was super cool and free! The pool was so relaxing and we met a lot of nice people. Loved relaxing at the pool and having drinks and food brought to us.
50,Birthday to see lady gaga's jazz piano concert. The most incredible experience for me and my friend! We didn't even have to leave the hotel to get the best of everything! I especially loved the haus of gaga museum food Starbucks availability of salon and spa and the amazing wellness room we got upgraded to for my 50th birthday and because of my health needs on floor 23. The extra from the staff everywhere were out of this world! Loved our experience!
50,I decided To stay here because it was smoke free. The rooms are a nice size and very clean. I would Recommend this hotel and stay here again. Housekeeping has no problem getting us what we needed and front desk answered any questions that I had.
50,Hotel staff was excellent bed was very comfortable pool was relaxed and casino was smoke free! Would definitely recommend Park MGM for its location as well. Loved Eataly being connected and the tram that goes to Bellagio.
50,We really enjoyed the atmosphere here. Loved it being a non-smoking hotel/casino. There are 4 different pools to choose from some of them are adult only which is great since this is a family friendly hotel too.
30,The saving grace here is the non-smoking in the hotel. The rooms are dated and the walls look like someone threw up green everywhere. Whatever theme they were going for here was a miss in my books. Staff were good as expected and Eataly is hand to have downstairs. If the rooms are important to you then this may not be the place for you.
10,I brought my parents here for an early Mother’s Day outing beyond Lady Gaga’s jazz show I don’t think a single thing went “right.” Incredibly disappointing and upsetting experience and a bad look for the brand.    I am aware that MGM makes enough money that my saying I will NEVER return to this hotel is nbd - but I hope no other family ever has to deal with what my parents did on what I was really hoping would have been a nice short trip. Next time I will go to The Palazzo like I wanted to.    1. Arrived on time for 3pm check in and was told our room was not ready - the hotel could potentially not have a room ready until 6pm. The desk basically made it sound like a fault of mine for choosing a suite (“strip” view). Once we received notification that the room WAS ready housekeeping was still present// chilling on the couch on her cell phone. I would normally consider this a non-issue/not even mention it however -    2. We did not want or need full housekeeping services but did want fresh towels the next day. The housekeeping staff member my mother approached (same lady) was rude/ confrontational and basically did not want to give her anything. She asked for me to personally come and request (I was in the shower at the time). I booked the hotel room but both of my parents were listed as guests of record with the hotel - so I had a very hard time understanding this.    3. What ultimately ruined our stay was my father being accosted by security at the casino floor on the third day. My father was walking around the floor looking for a certain set of slot machines that he is familiar with and enjoys playing. At one point he realized that he was inadvertently approaching a security guard with what I understand to be a cash box on the casino floor. Once he realized this he changed direction to give security space and went on his way. My dad found a slot machine sat down to play looked up and found himself surrounded by security.    Allegedly the initial guard with the cash box asked my dad a question - which my dad did not hear because he was already walking in another direction. This apparently then prompted that security guard to issue an urgent call and have my dad rushed by security as a potential threat. My dad has social anxiety but does OK in certain spaces - this was beyond upsetting to him. Luckily one of the security team present was level-headed enough to talk to my dad realize what was *actually going on and de-escalate the situation but the damage was done. Were they going to physically assault provoke a medical emergency or maybe even kill my father because one of their team is unprofessional / paranoid? And then chalk it up to a misunderstanding?    I left my information with the concierge desk in this regard I am requesting a formal follow up from hotel management.
10,The check in staff and the ground floor. are the nicest part of Park MGM. The rooms are rundown apartments with trashy red drapes. The bed had bugs crawling on it and flying around. The staff did not resolve the matter and I had to book another hotel elsewhere.
40,A great value with fantastic location. Access to the Tram to Bellagio is a big plus. Rooms are clean but average quality as they feel old and a little run down especially the carpet. Good tv though!!!
40,Very nice hotel with great amenities. Brought my daughter and friend to celebrate her 18th Birthday. Room was clean but smelled heavily of marijuana when we arrived. No refrigerator and couch had noticeable stains. Aside from these things we had a great stay. The hotel is smoke free ( which was great) except for the initial smell in our room. Casino had many options. Pool was very nice.
40,Awesome room color and artwork! Staff all very helpful. The only downside is no refrigerator in the room. Another positive aspect of this resort is the location a 2 minute walk to the CVS for anything you forgot to bring.
50,We enjoyed our stay. View was really nice. Room and hotel were very clean. Only casino where we won any money lol. Nonsmoking aspect is wonderful. The theater is really nice and we enjoyed our event there.
50,Really liked the restaurants and the wuick service for food and drinks st Eataly. Loved the meal I had at Bavettes Steakhouse - great atmosphere - delicious food and attentive waiters! I was also sble to relax out in the pool area too.
50,The no smoking was #1 for me. I like the minimalist vibe in the room. View (pool) was good. Check in was a breeze. More laid back middle age crowd which was perfect. Easy to navigate and find your way around the resort.
50,This is my favorite spot to stay in Vegas! The location is great you walk out of Eataly and right onto the strip and they have a monorail if you want to visit Bellagio Aria or Vdara (other MGM properties). The rooms were clean and a good size (we booked a basic two queen room). The staff is great so hospitable helpful and fun! Pools are awesome (drinks are pricey but it is vegas). Happy hour at the wine shop is an amazing deal if you lost some money in the casino and want to drink good for cheap! Juniper is awesome for some fancy drinking before or after a nice dinner. Overall a great place to stay in Vegas
50,Never an issue while staying at the property. Friendly personal at check in always makes it a breeze.Great location on the strip. Rooms were ok but I'm not there to spend time in them other than sleep and take a shower.Will definitely stay at this property again
50,Parkmgm is a wonderful property. Being non smoking is a plus There are great restaurants Babette’s a fabulous steak house Eatily an Italian restaurant with many options for dining La Noodle is a great Asian restaurant Nomad Bar has good food and great entertainment. The casino has a good assortment of slots and tables. The pools are wonderful and has a lot of chairs and cabanas. There is a huge theatre that always have great stars and wonderful shows.
50,Clean bright Casino with good variety of machines. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Easy to move around the casino floor. Went to lady GAGA concert. Great show in a beautiful concert venue. Very good food choices.
50,Really liked the digital experience here. Checked in gained entrance to the garage used phone as room key and checked out all on my iPhone. You do have to find your way through the navigation somewhat but it worked fine most of the time. Loved Eatily and dined here several times as well.
50,Park MGM is a smoke free casino so it is great! They have very clean quiet rooms. Access to other venues is excellent! Bathrooms are clean and near any casino area. Starbucks is in the casino. Several restaurant are in the casino from italian steak house and noodles! We ate a lot! Great time!
50,Very nice and clean atmosphere!! Very friendly staff and accommodating. No smoking facility but didn’t mind at all. Had smoking areas outside. Loved the pool area with three pools and two bars that serves food as well. Loved their fresh fruit trays available!! Was a awesome trip overall!!
50,Amazing time amazing ammenities I absolutely love the food selections and the reasonable prices in the entire hotel from drinks to the price of the stay. Great dessert choices. Literally anything you want is here.
50,Hotel was beautiful great location. Great service. We had 10 in our party for a birthday and it was a fabulous time at the Park MGM. We rented a gazebo and had great service there also!! We had views of the strip and close to attractions as well.
50,Nice hotel room . Very Clean and decoration beautiful view to see the city and lights outside  good size bathroom and feel comfortable parking is easy and convenient front desk is friendly  price good
40,Only shortfall was no place to eat after 9 o’clock in the evening . Only expensive places. Loved the No smoking casino. Rooms comfortable and staff was friendly accommodating. Will be back for sure in the near future.
50,Park Hotel is a good base to explore The Strip. It is right next to T Mobile Arena and has a pedestrian bridge outside the East Doors to cross over Las Vegas Blvd. The rooms are pretty standard although the beds are very comfy and the A/C works great. There are 3 pools to choose from each with a walk-up bar.
50,Check in was really quick and easy check out was equally quick and easy. Room was excellent and well furnished. Would have been nice to have available printed information about the hotel and included eating places. Examples: you need reservations for breakfast days in advance what is the cost of items in the room mini bar etc.
40,I enjoyed this trip specially l liked most CO’s it’s nonsmoking casino and eatery street food it was very nice experience for me to try all kind Italian street food 👍👍👍also good location you can walk to area hotel and shoppingEverything was there
50,Very nice and comfortable rooms. Bathrooms nice and big. Very clean. Love that it is attached to the Dolby theatre. Casino not too big or small. I’ll be back in September and very much looking forward to it.
40,Have stayed here four times and have always had a good experience. Rooms are clean and comfortable with well-appointed bathrooms. Friendly staff and always feel very safe here. And it’s smoke-free!
30,Too expensive  Why pay parking when staying there?  As we are on our 70s we had to choose valet parking and for the last 20 + years we never paid  Black jack and other tables minimum bets were too high  We don’t like to go to other casinos to gamble
50,So nice with Eataly right there in the Park MGM and Lady Gaga playing there too. Very convenient and a nice property. The help at the registration desk are always so helpful. And I like the idea u have to have a room key to get the elevators to work a nice safety feature.
50,We choose the Park MGM because the Dolby Theater is located within the hotel but we'll be back even when we aren't seeing a show there. The rooms were stylish and comfortable. We loved that the hotel is smoke-free. The pool is great. The restaurants are great.
50,We had a wonderful stay. Loved the no smoking on the property. We were there five nights. Liked the ability to pull up the app and set a restaurant reservation. We have stayed at this property many times over the years and would recommend to others. The slots are lots of fun. The staff were very helpful.
50,Enjoyed the hotel very much will be back soon . The casino was awesome there pizza ice cream in the sports booking lounge was incredible. We had a great time at the pool and hot tub. The drink servers at the pool were awesome . Deb my card dealer was very personable
50,Had a great time. The non-smoking hotel and casino was awesome. The staff was friendly and very helpful. Can't thank Brooke Fonseca enough for going above and beyond to help us turn a bad situation into a positive experience. We truly enjoyed our stay and would most definitely recommend the MGM Park Las Vegas.
50,It was great. I love this property. Eataly is amazing the casino is beautiful great restaurants. All in all a great place to relax a few days.  Walked over to Aria and the shops there also fantastic.  Park MGM is really a beautiful property.
50,Great value and clean property. The location is ideal and the property has great food and incredible staff who are all kind. The pool staff were always accessible and accommodating and the pool food is great. The property is non smoking and for those who tried to smoke were addressed immediately. Lady Gaga was great and the area doesn’t smell like most of the other areas of Vegas now that marijuana is so easily accessible.
40,Clean rooms smoke free housekeeping prompt 3 lovely pools… friendly staff easy access to strip… good local restaurants. We would stay their again! Doby theater excellent to see Lady Gaga or any other act for that matter.
30,"The first room we were assigned was a disappointment. The bathroom had been used and not serviced (soap opened hand towels used etc.). We were easily switched by the very nice considerate and effective Tatiana at the front desk.  Everyone I interacted with at the front desk were great in fact.    For the positives the room was quiet and we had quiet neighbors. There were no bed bugs! The pillows smelled fresh. Also the beds were low to the ground. One member of my party is disabled and the low beds were great. We also loved the walk-in shower and brightness of the bathroom.    For the negatives the hall floors were stained. It looked like maybe someone flooded the whole floor at one time. Weird considering this place was renovated like 4 years ago (not counting the Covid shut down months). We got lost on a different floor and it had similar stains. It was not the carpet pattern either. I guess Vegas goers are a tough bunch these days.    The room walls are very thin. I could hear other conversations distinctly from different rooms.    The bathroom sink could have been scrubbed. Had some kind of mucus in it and I went to the Walgreens to finish cleaning up on my own. What is it with Vegas and not servicing rooms right?!?! It was like that last year at a totally different property on the north central strip and at a higher price point. I recently stayed at a Holiday Inn Express in NM and got a better level of housekeeping. A shame.    The décor of the room is tired looking. The flat screen bolted to the wall the beat up green 'leather' chair marred (but clean) wooden table and stained brown carpet made me have 1970s motel vibes. Shabby chic? Balenciaga Hobo? Don't know but it just felt cheap.    Room had an odor to it. Kind of like a kindergarten. Weird.    The room floor could have been vacuumed better. Crumbly.    The mattresses were a nice low height but the mattresses were extremely soft. For me that is a negative since it made you sink in and bend your neck and back while sleeping.    The MGM Rewards desk agent in the casino was not very welcoming or warm. She was with the people in front of me. She seemed great with me too until my name came up. My face really does not match my name so unsure what that was about! I have a very 'Anglo-Saxon' name and not a very 'Anglo-Saxon' face. Basically all the brown people were chummy until my Anglo name popped up. LOL. Reverse bias attitudes?!?! Regardless I got what I needed done and moved on with life. Not a big deal but it was kind of weird.    I inquired with the Bell Desk as to where the Avis desk was. In slightly older photos the Avis desk was where the Concierge is currently (no concierge when I walked up). The agent at the Bell Desk was really snarky and said something to the effect of: ""Well its right there!"" and pointed at a very tiny sign at the end of the counter. The Avis agent was at lunch. The Bell Desk agent made it feel like I ""should have known better."" Sorry but I do not work at Park MGM...I am supposed to be a guest. I am not a fan of rudeness. I can take blank faced efficiency or professional and accurate competence but not rudeness.    I also felt that everything was nickel and dimed. I am not afraid of the resort fee per se but then there is the parking fee too and the mandatory hold to your credit limit for in-resort purchases etc. Ugh. I would rather have something more 'all inclusive' rather than have this feeling of MGM management randomly picking bills out of my wallet. Again it is not about the amounts as much as the multiplicity of fees. A woman in the elevator (I think she was an international tourist as her English seemed limited) accidently tried to scan her credit card to get to her floor. She corrected herself with the room and I said: ""I know it feels like that."" Everyone laughed."
50,It was excellent all the staff there are more then helpful. Check in and check out where extremally easy. There was no waiting in lines. It was even during the NFL draft. Loved it. We went there for my daughter's 21st birthday. It was a great time. Places are easy to get too.
20,Stayed in a “Strip View” room that had a severely limited view of the strip. The rest of the room was very poorly laid out with no dresser or store clothes or anything of the like. Carpet was old and very outdated. Bathroom and shower were nice but that’s about it. Would definitely stay somewhere else.
50,Great stay in Vegas love the No Smoking casino hotel at Park! Staff pool food everything was great exceptional service! Loved the newer Italian eatery also. Eat at the newer sports book nice ! Thks we will be back !
50,We went to the Park MGM Hotel and Casino to see the Lady Gaga concert which was great. The casino was non smoking I couldn’t believe it. I am so tired of smoke smelling dirty casinos with dirty ash trays everywhere. This casino had no bad smells it was great!!! The cocktails and the service was good. The slot machines were also pretty good. A clean casino! Wonderful! I will definitely be back when I go to Las Vegas again.
40,We stayed for 3 nights and were very happy with this hotel. We purchased through Costco travel in Canada and it was a great deal. Great location right in the middle of the strip. We loved the fact that the hotel is non smoking. The room was clean and the shower pressure was amazing. Bed was comfortable. We were very surprised with how quiet our floor was. We rarely heard anyone! We stayed on the 10th floor in a king room. There wasn’t much dresser space but I don’t usually unpack my suitcase anyway. Plan for no fridge - I have heard this is common…we brought a soft cooler and filled it up with ice to keep our drinks cold. We visited the pool everyday. The only day we had issues finding chairs was Saturday but it didn’t take long for some to come up. The weather was fantastic and the pools were warm. I did find the pools a bit small it would have been nice to have a bit more space to actually swim around. The only major issue I faced was finding decent gluten free food options there seemed to be more choices around Paris and the Linq so next time we may stay closer to there.
50,We will book our next stay at Park MGM. Rooms are spacious. Staff is welcoming Casino smoke free. Check in and out is easy. Parking garage safe. Easy access to restaurants and shopping. Rooms have beautiful views.
50,We enjoyed our stay at this hotel nice and clean rooms good customer service from staff we encountered. The app to use to access the elevator and room was convenient. Located right on the Vegas strip but completely reasonable price. One thing is is it's across from the T-Mobile area so it could be loud if there are events but we didn't experience any of this staying during the week. But it's Vegas so who cares!
40,The Park MGM is a very nice casino hotel on the Vegas strip. The Eataly restaurants are great and the non-smoking aspect was wonderful surprise. I was not happy with the room location I was given on a busy Sat night but ok for a business trip.
30,Weird room very impractical to keep our cloth in order. Little Drawers. Instead of bulky round table in the middle of the room - you should place a furniture with more drawers. Also no courtesy water
20,For the price of the room (a little over 300 a night) the quality was not there. The room was consistently muggy and warm no matter how much we turned the temp down on the thermostat. We decided to stay there because the show we were seeing was in the hotel. Beyond that I don't see a reason to stay here again.
40,Rooms.are updated and bed was good. Great service at the Eatily area for wine and pizza. Will definitely be back. The location makes ut easy to get to everything including the airport. Bell guys were helpfull too.
40,The staff was amazing from the check in to check out. The rooms are clean and this is a no smoking hotel/casino. Major plus because the aroma throughout the facility was great and my allergies were not acting up. Lots of nearby food options. Keep in mind this is directly across the T-Mobile arena and the parking/traffic is a little chaotic
40,Clean hotel friendly staff and SMOKE FREE! The shower was a good size and had strong pressure. Rooms are on the darker side which I personally liked allowing for daytime naps. Rooms were spacious and had little neighbor noise. The club in the hotel on the record was fun and quaint. The food we did eat at some of the restaurants was on par with what I would expect. Bonus points for my drinks being mixed well throughout the stay. My major complaint is I had unreliable wifi in my room. Over all I did enjoy my stay and would come back again.
10,There were visible crumbs on the table and hair in the sink. I expect much more of a 4.5 star hotel. The location was great however and casino was nice. There are a ton of food options nearby but a room should be clean.
50,Loved the relaxing chairs in the pool. The cocktails were delicious especially the cucumber cooler with fresh cucumber. They had Hendricks to use also which is my favorite. I only was able to spend a few hours at the pool. Wish I would have been able to spend more time there. It was 90 and sunny and the pool temperature was perfect!!
50,Simple room but loved the smoke-feee environment of the entire property. I will be back and plan to spend the majority of my time on-site because of this. The proximity to Eataly and Dolby was awesome!
50,Very nice location. Not so large that it takes forever to get through the hotel or casino. Nice selection of restaurants/eating places. No smoking! Very comfortable pool area that is not a big party with lots of noise
40,Recently returned from a stay at this hotel. The hotel gets high marks from me for being smoke-free throughout (including the casino) and having great dining options. We enjoyed great meals at Bavette and Best Friend. Eatly is also located here and a good fast casual option.    The room was comfortable with a large bathroom. Bed was very comfy. We opted for early check-in and late check-out which is a great option when you have early/late flights.    There are 3 pools available on the property and never any issue securing a chair.
50,What a great place the addition of non-smoking makes it extremely pleasant as well as the various restaurants that have an Italian base food theme. It's location to the monorail system is convenient if you're attending conventions at the center
50,Love the fact that the casino is smoke free and the rooms are comfortable and very clean. Pillows are soooo nice. Would have preferred a room closer to the elevators but made it work. Will likely stay there again if I come to Las Vegas.
30,Casino and dining experience not good. We had better ones at other casinos. Three card poker rules were change to give more odds to the casino. Dining experience in Park MGM is not good at all. Not sure if I could recommend this place.
50,Always a good time in Vegas -- but truly love the clean smoke free environment and the amazing pools! The restaurants are awesome and the entertainment is so close by- everything on the strip easy to access! Will stay again for sure!
40,Just got back from a girl's weekend staying at the park MGM. This hotel was extremely clean it's extremely clean and all staff members we encountered were extremely polite. Preston appreston at the ticket counter was was amazing. If you need tickets please go see him.. Rooms were nice or nice clean showers nothing over the top But nice. The fact that this casino and hotel is completely non smoking was a added plus for us. Recommend!!!
50,Staff is personable! Stay is perfect for the Lady Gaga show! My 24-year-old son and I stayed for 3 nights. Check-in and check-out were super easy. Room is spacious and laid out well. Great location! Parking is easy!
50,This is a very nice casino. It’s smaller and more laid back than other casinos but in a good way. It’s close enough to all of the others to enjoy those as well but this one is cozy and non smoking which keeps us from headaches while enjoying our favorite games.
50,We loved everything about the Park MGM. Our room was spotless great view of the strip from our 20th floor room. We loved Eataly and Primrose. The hotel is in a great location. We loved the shower great water pressure. The electronic check in and check out was time saving. We will definitely be back.
40,Not a party place - and that's a good thing. Clean comfortable lots of food options. I've stayed all over Vegas - from high end to low. This is a mid/hi experience at a low end price. DOWNLOAD THE APP - you will thank me.
50,This hotel was clean and smell good. The rooms were clean and didn’t have any issues with anything inside the room. I would recommend a friend to stay at this hotel and with it being on the strip and close to other hotels to visit.
50,Great central location. Nice that the property is smoke free. All the staff were interacted with were very friendly Pool was great and not over crowded. Check in and out was quick and hassle free. Will stay here again.
20,The Monte Carlo was always my favorite Hotel but it was getting pretty worn down I really like the new Park remodel and rooms but the last two stays were getting pretty disgusting. I cant believe they are already letting this place fall apart. I also dont like having to walk thru Eataly to get to the casino they is never an open path and you have to push by peoples tables trying to eat it so stupid. The rooms were cleaner during covid now it looks like all they do is make the bed. The floor was hardly vacuumed and there was dust on every surface.
40,I’ve been to Vegas 4 or 5 times and have stayed somewhere deferent each trip. The Park MGM turned out to be a pleasant surprise. The rooms were affordable so I booked two for me and some friends. All of us loved the hotel. Great place if you’re looking for somewhere a little more “quiet” and not as rowdy. Very clean non smoking casino. Less of a “party vibe” which was perfect for me and my pals. More classy than some of the other casinos. Room was a decent size with a small couch. Plenty of places to eat and relax on the property. Will probably book again.
50,Very clean. Good food casino and table game are great  Easy to check in and self checkout. Staff very friendly  Perfect location. Park across the street and stadium also. Primrose was very good food Italy eatery is good choice also
20,Non smoking was very nice however the interior space design of the room was terrible. The was no dresser in the room. There should have been a dresser under the TV to provide storage and an shelf.  The bathroom had no storage area. There should be a shelf under the sink and there should have been at least two or more towel racks. The hotel management staff should spend a couple of nights in a room to understand terrible interior space design and lack of storage.  Another problem was that although I was MGM gold and should have been assigned an room upgrade we got a room on the 4th floor with a view of the garbage area. If this was a upgrade I would hate to see what a average room was like.
30,I've stayed at many hotels in Vegas from the Wynn to MGM and wanted to check out the Park since it remodeled and since it was Non Smoking. Unfortunately it didn't really live up to expectations and I wouldn't stay again. Overall value for cost was poor.    After a long drive we arrived around 8PM on a Friday and there was only 1 bellman working. We had to hunt him down to find assistance with our stuff. I decided to use the mobile check in and upon arrival when I went to check into my room it let me check into an already occupied room. When I went down to the front desk they apologized with a $25 food and bev credit and gave me a new room. However they were not able to give me the 2 queen bedroom that I booked and I ended up in a Handicap Accessible room with 1 bed for my 3 night stay. I came back down to the desk to see if I could get the type of room I booked but they said they didn't have one. I asked if they could move me the next morning they said they couldn't guarantee it and told me to come back around noon to check. I already had plans for noon so I just dealt with it. They gave me an additional $50 food and bev credit but again this really doesn't solve the problem and I wasn't planning on spending that much time on site so I didn't really feel satisfied with that resolution.    I never got comfortable in the room because the bed had dust bunnies all over the corner of the mattress by the pillows and one of the pillow cases had a hole in it. The vanities in the bathroom are super small and overall the decor just seemed dated. My room didn't have any waters or snacks for purchase like the other rooms in the rest of our group did.    We ate at Bavettes and the Bar at Nomad and both of those were pretty good however Primrose was a bit frustrating. We wanted to grab a quick drink after our long drive but even though it was the lobby bar it wasn't open and then we ate there for breakfast on Monday morning and the service was crazy slow and the cappuccino's looked like water. Food tasted fine but overall still not a good experience.    When you think about how many other amazing resorts there are for the same cost the non smoking didn't make it worth it. I'd rather stay across the street at MGM or just pay a little more for one of the better resorts on the strip. Didn't feel the value at all for $700+.
20,The only good thing about the hotel is the location and the food around it. Ok the staff are nice but they don’t clean the rooms daily . I hoped that the first night we stayed it was cleaned before our arrival.
50,Wonderful rooms for the price beautiful decor all the staff act like it's thier mission to make your stay the best possible and Eataly has the most amazing food! From the time we checked in until the day we left it was so enjoyable! I'm looking forward to my next vacation!
50,We were staying at a Ceasar's property but came to gamble at Park MGM. They have a no smoking policy! My wife and I cannot handle the sinus irritation smokers nearby cause us at other casinos. The dealers we had for our favorite game Pai Gow were fantastic also. Fransisco Betancourt and Veronica Ortiz were extremely friendly and wonderful! We had a lot of fun and will definitely be back!
20,Location has limitations from how long the pools are open to predatory 60 second sensors that will bill you for touching the water bottles etc. There is a resort fee here per day. Also be aware that hotel rooms have limited amenities like storage for your clothes. Rooms gets messy really quick without drawers.
40,Location great room mediocre at best. Food selection is ok. Smoke free is the best! Rooms need better ac systems! Excellent for budget and location. Would stay again for sure! Just gotta figure out how to override sensor for ac so it stays on while you sleep!
50,great service and plenty of options for entertainment. lost a phone and staff was more than helpful locating and returning it. walking distance to everything and rooms are clean. all staff was very courteous.
50,I had at great time at the park mgm they staff was very friendly and helpful. The free tram to the bellagio really saved us alot of time with the streets being closed for the draft. The amenities were great and the rooms were very clean
30,Pros: the lobby is small and therefore fast access to taxi/Uber. Check in process was fast.    Cons: pretty much everything else. Shower and TV were broken. Food is mediocre all around especially room service which is very poor. Noise from outside was VERY loud through the windows which are old and thin.    But it’s half the price of other hotels on the strip…
50,Great Hotel and location! You can walk to the Aria and take the trams to the Crystal Shops and Bellagio. You can also walk to MGM Grand to take the trams to Mandalay Bay. The food at the hotel is very good and the location is very convienent.
50,This was our first stay at this hotel since it changed from the Monte Carlo. I was a little hesitant as our last stay as the Monte Carlo was not great. I had not heard a lot of the changes so was not sure how much they had really improved. Well colour us impressed. Everything was great. Clean comfortable and friendly. Could not have asked for a nicer over all experience. Highly recommend.
30,The staff is friendly. Nice pool area. In a good location on the strip. Rooms are very dated and need renovating. The color scheme in the room is an awful green color. Having the restaurant Eataly is a plus.
50,We had a ball & will return next year for part three….. the staff and housekeeping was very friendly & didn’t hesitate when we ask for anything….. parking was very affordable & easy to come and go as will
50,The room was very clean and spacious. I was able to check in/out on the mobile app. It was so easy and convenient. The casino was clean and access to the strip was easy. We enjoyed our night away and plan to return soon.
40,Great Price for the location. The rooms are basic but a nice size. The rooms were cleaned well and regularly. The showers have very good water pressure. The staff was great. Biggest issue is the walls are thin you can hear everything from the neighbors and hallway.
50,We love that it is a non smoking property. It is great to smell fresh air while enjoying your stay. It’s a great location on the strip for what we like to do. The staff are friendly rooms are clean. We’ve stayed twice now and will stay again next Vegas trip:)
10,Absolutely no dresser space. Had to live out of my suitcase for a week. Not my idea of a vacation. You get more space at a Hampton Inn. Solution from front room......upgrade to a new room at $130.00 more per night.
50,Everything from the staff rooms pool casino and restaurant choices was too superb! The location on the strip and the smoke-free environment made it an even better space. We will be back for sure! Thank you!
50,The service sleeping room product and location were all great. The restaurant selection was very nice. The rooms were very clean and nicely decorated. Staff was friendly and helpful. I'll be back and do recommend this hotel for both pleasure and business travelers.
50,Clean and spacious rooms. Great location with access other MGM properties by walking or by tram. Good food selections available to choose from within the casino. Friendly staff provided great service.
40,I could not sleep as my neighbors sounded as if they were in my room because of the adjoining door! it was not insulated and there was a large open space at the bottom of the door ... i could see them walking around. the light was shining into my room from the bottom of the door. they were loud. i asked them to keep it down and they would not.
50,Thoroughly enjoyed my stay at the Park MGM. Very clean rooms and comfortable bed/pillows. Housekeepers did great job maintaining room. I prefer south side of strip so location was perfect for me. Smoke-free environment was fantastic - more hotels should follow suit. Easy check-in and -out process. Will stay there again 😀
50,Clean and smoke free casino with great places to eat. Prime Rib sandwich is a must eat at Eataly. Make sure you get and MGM Rewards card to enjoy all the other perks that come with the membership. I've always stayed at the MGMgrand for the last 5 years ParkMGM is now my new place to stay every time I visit.
40,We’ve been to Vegas a dozen times and have finally found our favourite resort!    #1 reason would be that it is smoke free! The minute you walked through their doors it was fresh and pleasant. So enjoyable being on a casino floor without the odour of cigars & cigarette.    #2 Staff from the minute we checked in were friendly. Every staff member we encountered from the cleaning staff bartenders check in and on sight restaurants were great.    #3 Pool area was very spacious with several pools to choose from. Loved that there was an adult only section as well. You can move from pool to pool to stay in the sun all day! Plenty of seating available.    #4 Variety of food choices nearby. Eately was refreshing compared to the same old choices in many of the other resorts. Best Friends had a cool vibe. Enjoyed Quack Shake.    #5 Location was great! We overlooked T-Mobile Area. Would definitely recommend that side of resort. The outside Park area was fun for pregame activities for the Golden Knights & people watching before the concerts. Felt very safe.    #6 We found the bed to be very comfortable. Loved the seating in front of the window I called my perch. Great to watch the action near T-Mobile or the views of mountains Allegiant Stadium NYNY roller coaster.    Only negative would have to be the lobby on our floor. It was very dark and carpet was quite dingy. I can overlook that for the amount of time we’re in that area.
10,"My wife and I booked a Stay Well King through the Park MGM website. When we arrived we were informed that the room that is booked does not guarantee a specific room and there were ""no Stay Well and no King rooms available."" We were stuck in a double queen room that was really just an extremely mediocre room at best. Despite multiple phone calls there was zero attempt whatsoever to remedy the situation. Additionally despite these calls I have still been charged the higher rate for a room and no one has been able to fix this situation. Extraordinarily disappointing and I would not chance a stay again at this property."
50,I had a great time at the Park MGM Las Vegas  The hotel is clean it smells great compare to many of the casinos in Vegas. I love the non-smoking aspect.  Eataly is awesome and has a great selection of food. I enjoyed the view I had in my room. I could for sure come back
50,Rooms and casino clean! Smoke free. Excellent customer service! Friendly staff. Great selection of eateries on property. Property is near stores and close to other casinos. Great location! Definitely recommend
40,It was a nice hotel the rooms were very nice. The couch by the window is a nice touch. The art (artfully arranged) was also fully appreciated. Eataly was great! Great for quick snack quick drink and even an afternoon of drinking bubbly with a charcuterie and pasta.
50,Had a wonderful stay. Loved that the property is nonsmoking. Cocktails and live music at The Primrose was the perfect way to start an evening. If you are seeing a show at The Dolby Theater this is the perfect place to stay.
50,If you want a smoke free Vegas experience this hotel is for you.  It was nice eating drinking and gambling without the annoyance of being surrounded by cigarette smoke.  The rooms were comfortable and quiet.  The grounds were manicured and clean.
40,If you need to stay in Vegas and have minimal hotel expectations if you are getting a good rate than here is fine. Room is simple but modern. They are too dumb to list the small breakfast joint (Primrose) on their hotel restaurant list but you'll need reservations if you want to avoid a wait. Automated check-in doesn't tie room key to parking ticket.
50,Great time in a clean smoke free environment.  Access to the tram is incredibly easy and great way to get around.  Eataly is amazing and we found ourselves repeatedly drawn there at all times of the day.
50,It was always clean everyone was friendly and I love that it didn't smell like cigarette smoke. Super comfortable and familiar. The pool water is nice.  It seems to me that they have an excellent location I love the eataly
50,Park MGM is one of our favorite places to stay. There are many different options of activities all within walking distance. Gambling shows food and fun everything is right there. The hotel is clean and friendly.
50,Non smoking was fantastic the Vegas experience with out the tobacco 5 stars Absolutely no asses smoking anywhere. it was fantastic. If you want clean air and a good gambling time this i your choice
50,Excellent place to stay Great Staff! I asked about upgrading my room and had great help at the VIP desk and was able to upgrade my room as it was a Monday and not on the week end. Hotel was clean and same with the Casino floor.
50,I loved the warmth of the staff and how accommodating the front desk was. Excellent amenities and the location is so convenient. The room was perfect although we could have used a mini fridge. We will definitely be back!
50,I enjoyed the amazing care delivered by everyone my room the smoke free casino EATALY Primrose other restaurants etc. this is my new go to hotel!    My room was basic and cozy the experience wonderful everything i needed was at my fingertips - the service from all exceptional!
50,This was one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in! The staff amenities and ease of mind that came with staying here was top tier. I am definitely booking a room to stay here again! This hotel fits me the best because it doesn't overwhelm me like the big name hotels.
50,First having this be 100% non smoking is fantastic. Everything smelled so clean and fresh. Eatily is such a fun idea…like an Italian street fair…with all the skylights it’s so bright and inviting. We had dinner at La Pizza e La Pasta and it was delicious! Also picked up breakfast sandwiches and grabbed Italian pastries to go. We also reserved nice cushy chairs at the adult pool and had a very relaxing day…worth every penny! Also my friend left a coat sweater and belt in the closet when we checked out…which honestly we didn’t think we would see them again. We filled out a lost and found form and called and left a message…received a call on Monday that the items had been found…we were still staying at another location in Vegas so we’re able to run back over there and pick them up. Great customer service. Thank you! We will be back for sure!
50,Hotel is very user friendly. Not too big and not too small. Lots of great restaurants with any type of food you could want. Steakhouse is tremendous. Very convenient location. Smoke-Free is the best feature.
50,We finally made it to Vegas from N.Y. We had planned this trip way back in early 2020.  The Park MGM is really a nice place to stay. The staff is friendly and helpful.  Every place that we ate in the casino had really good food. It is an easy walk to other casinos and it is also very easy to pick up a ride share at the drop off zone. The slots were some of the best that we played  during our stay. They at leas let us play. Making reservations was easy and the reservation staff really helped out with all of our needs. Great job. Nice place good people fine food.
50,We had a great time and enjoyed staying at park mgm. The location makes the hotel very appeasing. Everything was very clean and comfortable. Casino staff went above and beyond when I had an issue with a machine.
50,Everything you need is within walking distance. T-Mobile arena is across the street and the Dolby Live Theatre in on site Good food choices. Bavette's is a drop the mic culinary experience! Ask for AJ.
50,Park MGM is awesome. The smoke free casino is a game changer. Best Friends is a cool place to eat. The rooms are comfortable and the location on the strip can't be beat. The hotel hosts the best concerts and there a no bad seats in the concert venues.
50,Park MGM is one of our favorite hotels on the strip. Great restaurants nice rooms and the location to everything on the strip is awesome. All of the employees are super nice! Eataly is fun to walk around and you can always find good wine and food there.
10,The rooms were not clean. The walls are paper thin. I could hear people talking coughing watching television all through the night. No need to set your alarm if you need to be up at a certain time in the morning. The several times a night being awoken by those nuisances plus doors slamming in the hall guarantees you'll be awake after a sleepless night. Isn't Vegas a 24/7 city? Not in this hotel everything except the tiny casino closes at midnight. Never again. Never.
50,After a not great 1st experience with MGM in NJ Park knocked it out of the well PARK! Beautiful relaxing rooms amazing staff delicious food and perfect location on the strip for walking site seeing and people watching. Overall I enjoyed my stay and hope to come back on property with family and or friends. Of course solocations are self-care and I could come back for another one of those too!
50,I recently quit smoking so staying at a smoke-free hotel was a must! I cannot tell you how good it smells here genuinely the lobby has the freshest and comforting scent. They should sell it as a home fragrance in their gift shop.
20,The hotel was nice- the rooms are not in the middle of a casino like other hotels so that was nice. But the outside was full of homeless trashy crackheads. One pooped right at the front door and there was also poop on Tuesday. The room walls where paper thin so you could hear people in the other room doing stuff all hours of the night. Terrible nights of sleep. Never again.
50,cleanest and best  hotel on the strip! smoke free is always a major okay. they have great food options and it’s very close to the t-mobile arena. during game days the energy is always amazing and great to see.
40,We have stayed at the Park several times. Location is great with the arena and Dolby within walking distance. Aria is also close by as is NY NY. The dining options at Eataly are great. There are also some other choices in house such as La La Noodle. Would be great if the casino was larger and there was a cigar bar as no smoking is sort of anathema to gambling.
50,Everything was great service cleanliness of the room and in general. The food court has an Italian theme based which is very nice however you won't find any other type of food options. But overall a very nice experience
50,Loved how clean smelling the casino floor was. I have an appreciation for the old school smoking casinos but I much prefer the smokeless park mgm. Staff were very friendly and the eataly had fantastic options.
40,Everything was great besides the warm rooms. I couldn't get it comfortable when trying to go to sleep. The interaction that I had with the catering staff for the conference were very nice and super talkative
20,"This is a SMOKE-FREE Casino- I did not know that. Rooms were cheaper the day we checked in than what we paid and they would not honor new rates. Drinks are more expensive than other casinos. Room was average and not cleaned every day because of ""staff shortage"". Some staff were amazingly helpful others were really awful. The tram to Bellagio was really great though. The location is pretty decent actually. But overall this was an average experience."
30,Location isn't bad. It's very nice it being smoke free hotel and casino. Overall cleanliness of room was below satisfactory. The little Itali market they have is cute however the way they have it set up for people to eat at the places is is kind of annoying and there was only one breakfast place open before 11am and they only sold 3 different kind of sandwiches and it took us 45 minutes just to get to a little sandwiche. The 2 people making them walk away multiple times and we're gone for a long periods of time and we watched them talk to each other without cooking couple of times as well. The wait time was not due to too many orders but the employees just choosing to not make the food. They also burned the bread of our sandwiches so the sandwiches didn't even taste good.
50,Super clean hotel. Great location with friendly staff. Smoke free. Big rooms. Food was amazing and great gambling. Check in was smooth and could also check in on my phone along with getting in and out of the parking garage.
20,Love the hotel the room was acceptable food & shows fantastic and 95% of the staff had outstanding customer service. Awful frustrating room key issues tram down and nobody knew it nor knew why plus unfulfilled room requests and a few rude people at front desk made what should have been an amazing girls' trip an awful situation which ruined our time. Those individuals had no empathy and night-time manager did not hear the entire situation from the guest's side.
50,It was so awesome I loved it. It was a beautiful hotel great service friendly staff great hospitality I will definitely be back to stay at Park MGM!!! It was just overall a great experience and a great stay well worth it thank you Park MGM again for my awesome time in VEGAS!!!!
30,The non-smoking casino was the best part. When staying at other hotels in Vegas we have always experienced awesome customer service. Here it was “meh” and just the bare minimum. Small selection of table games and room was mediocre with a clogged sink. Probably would not book again.
50,I had never stayed at the Park MGM before so I didn't know what to expect when our room there was included with our Lady Gaga package. I will say I am so impressed. The level of service was off the charts for what I was anticipating and I can't wait to stay there again.
30,We had our catalytic coverter stolen in the parking garage (we parked at 2B). Security said they did no have cameras there. I am hesitant about going back unless they heighten their security. I had to rent a car to get home and will have to go back for my vehicle. This is going to cost over $5k. Terrible! I know I'm not the first to have this happen.
30,Very simple hotel. All the essentials. Nothing extra. Clean. However the floor hallways were very dark ugly and scary to walk. Small casino but I didn't care. A few restaurants but very good. Great EATALY addition.
50,The mattress are so comfortable. The ease of Eatly made it easy to get food or drinks right away. Some of the hotel bars were closed at night on a weekday. Central location. Would definitely stay again. Staff are awesome.
50,Great customer service and amazing food. Good location on the strip and not to mention a smokeless casino. Also they offer check in thru your phone so you can avoid the lines. Definitely worth checking out when in Vegas.
50,Its easy getting in and out has the tram for easy access wonderful dining wine !!!!!! Starbucks!!!!and a theater!!!!swimming pools beautiful great gift shops the decore fun friendly the rooms clean artwork good vibes
10,Where to start? The bathroom was so small that the towel stand was in front of the toilet forcing you to position your legs so you didn't knock them every time you used the toilet. Despite the upgraded rooms promising a luxurious walk-in shower we had an old small bathtub. The bedroom had no chest of drawers where you could unpack your clothes. There was no closet where you could hang your clothes. Instead there was a mirrored armoir that was only big enough to hand 4-5 items of clothing (and it had an ironing board in it that took most of the space). There was a used can of Red Bull in our room when we checked in and holes in the towels. There was no apology when I rang the front desk about this. They just tole me to throw away the can. As for the room they acknowledged that it wasn't a good bathroom but there was nothing they could do as the hotel was full (I even offered to pay more for an upgraded room). All of this was especially disappointing because I had told the hotel when I booked the room that we were celebrating our 29th wedding anniversary. The only good thing I can say about the hotel is that it is non-smoking and the staff are excellent but when faced with all these other issues I would pick any other hotel in Las Vegas before I would stay at the Park MGM again.
50,We have stayed at many MGM properties but I have to say I was very impressed with Park. It was very clean loved the no smoking casino the food was great Starbucks was in a great location. It is a great value! We will be back!
50,This is the only completely non-smoking property that I'm aware of on the main strip which is huge plus for me. Rooms are a standard size but the minimal furnishings make it feel larger. Appreciate the environmentally friendly options of opting out of daily cleaning and using a digital key. Bed is comfy though pillows were a bit too puffy. Blackout curtains were great. Wardrobe a bit small so not many places to store clothes. (Not a big deal for a short stay if you're living out of your suitcase anyway.) Tram available to Crystals shops and Bellagio was convenient.
20,Loved the non-smoking didn't love the lack of clothes storage and having bath towels taking up sink space due to no racks in the bathroom. Bathroom sink was filthy and clogged took 2 days to fix the problem.
50,Very good price. Great location on the strip. Easy access from the airport.  Pool was very nice and clean with lots of beach chairs to use. Drinks were quite expensive but overall would highly recommend the resort.
40,About every six months my wife and I enjoy a trip to Las Vegas We usually stay at the Park MGM because of the location. We enjoy many of the food facilities in the area to the around the Park MGM. We also find the transportation is easier from that location as we do like to attend various shows along the blvd.
50,Large comfortable rooms quiet location but in the middle of the action excellent restaurant choices and a great price! I especially enjoyed breakfast at Primrose Cafe and dinner at Best Friends. Contactless check in and out was a nice touch- very convenient.
30,Unfriendly pit boss marred our otherwise pleasant stay. In the future my group will venture away from Park MGM for gaming and entertainment. The rooms were fine and the hotel staff were pretty good. Hostile table gaming staff.
50,The PARK MGM is beautiful. All things were awesome Room Staff Casino. Will return and you all should also GO to THE PARK MGM and have the same great exsperience we had. My wife and I are 76 and 79 and the staff accomodated any time we needed it.
40,I didn’t realize the prime location when we booked with the other casinos and eating options close by. The hotel itself was clean and well ran. They did a good job at check in moving everyone through. The pool was a welcome surprise. It is broken into different smaller pools with a couple for 18+ and one family pool. Our 18+ was really lively with everyone very friendly. The casino although a little small was more than adequate. Downsides: unlike many other casinos you have to pay for parking and the closet/bathroom door can be tricky with two people.
50,We chose this hotel because a member of our family has a lung disease and we were traveling for a martial arts tournament. Having a smoke free environment was AWESOME. This was our first time here and we will be booking again.
50,We found the location to be perfect. Lots of food close by pool was nice and we loved the smoke free environment. We went to see a concert and being able to just go straight down to the theater was easy as could be. Juniper Bar was also a high point
10,Dirty room staff wasn't too friendly walls are very thin and you could hear all the street noise. I booked this hotel due to its great location but completely regret it now especially since some of the more popular hotel names are actually cheaper than this place.
10,Do you want your room opened to the public for hours? Do you want paper thin walls you can hear every word sneeze and fart of your neighbor? Do you want unfriendly staff? Then this is your place! Disclaimer: true statements*
40,It was and nice decent hotel to stay within amazing check in process. I was bit disappointed with Room which was allocated to me. It had insects in the bathroom which is not expected at park MGM standard. When reported at the time of checkout I was being told to request for an inspection before you check in which sounded surprising. Yes they did waived off my resort fee and parking fee in compensation which was again a good sign of a hotel wants to maintain healthy customer relationship.
40,Great non-smoking location on the strip. Eatly is amazing. Charming boutique style hotel but lacks some of the glitz that other strip hotels offer. However much more calm and lowkey vacation type experience.
40,Came here for 4 nights. Stayed in the Night Hawk suite which was very nice. Bed was decent and nice bathroom. Elevators close to the entrance. 2 large pools and very nice fitness center. $15 table games available in a smaller casino setting. Small sports book and no poker tables. Bunch of restaurants including the Eataly. Non smoking casino. Valet very quick to get your car.  Good central location and plenty of shows at the Dolby theater.
50,Smoke free and clean resort. Stayed in a strip view room with views of MGM Grand and the airport. The room was basic but clean. The Eataly area was an enjoyable dining experience and enjoyed the Primrose restaurant every morning of our stay.
50,My wife and I enjoy the stay in these hotels it was the best smell and cleanest hotel in alas Vegas ! The best part is a None smoke hotel and that was a 100. We love this hotel !! Kids friendly and also the pool and the food is great .
50,Did a lot in 2 days around the town and needed the rest. PARK MGM provided a nice quiet and comfy stay. Rooms were clean the whole resort was great. Gym was perfect for a quick hour workout and the poolside service and reservation made was amazing. Don't doubt staying here just do it :)
50,Would highly recommend this hotel. Excellent service ..fun casino and totally non smoking! Also central location ample self parking except when they sold space for the hockey game … a bit of a nightmare
50,Park MGM is so nice and clean. Friendly staff. Good drinks. Wish I won more lol. Rooms are very comfortable. Rooms made up early every day. I highly recommend park MGM. The no smoking policy makes it extra special.
50,Classy Spot.. everything was wonderful... cant wait to go back!! Park MGM was great and smoke free!!! No one was acting stupid and I cant wait to go back!! Love again that it was smoke free! It really does make a difference.
20,When we checked in we got 2 queens instead of what we paid for. Because there was a concert we were put at the bottom of the list for priority. We also walk out with bites all over us. Not happy campers. Please be cautious when booking.
50,Its a great location and a smoke free hotel and casino. Lots of food choices. Easy use of ride share pick up and drop off. Pool area has adult only area. Short ride to hotel from airport. I hope they put coffee pots in rooms soon.
30,Even though Park MGM is fairly new the rooms seem outdated I was upgraded to the Nomad section which is supposed to be higher end but it was just an average room. Room was complimentary due to having the MGM card but still paid over $180 for resort fees. Staff was very friendly table minimums were a little high.
40,Only downside for me lack of healthy food options at hotel. Beer garden and food trucks across the road in park like setting. Eataly was great! Starbucks in lobby big Bonus ! Pools are on the small side.
50,This was a Great Hotel. The rooms were very nice and Super clean. Also it was not as noisy as many other hotels. The staff is friendly and very helpful. The check in experience is fast and easy. Will definitely stay again.
50,We redeemed our pop slots rewards to prepare for our las vegas trip. It was all worth it and the app was so helpful to check in and check out. Everything is organized and clean. It was a decent place to stay for a night. Thank you so much!
50,Smoke free casino and a great location. Eataly is wonderfull with many options to choose from and an awsome bakery. Rooms are clean and they have 3 pools to choose from. The only drawback is a lack of dresser space for clothes
50,Love the fact that Park MGM is smoke free. Definitely a huge bonus for my wife and myself. Rooms were comfy and clean. Staff there were friendly. WIll definitely stay there again if and when I go back to Las Vegas!
30,We stayed in a king room. Room was very basic with no mini fridge. Hotel was clean and casino very nice for non-smokers. Cleaning staff did a great. Would recommend you get a suite instead of a regular room. Free tram was a huge help
50,We love staying at the Park MGM. This property is located in a prime location. Easy to walk to surrounding properties. The smoke-free casino is nice and the rooms are awesome. Great choice of food too!
50,This is a really great property in terms of size. Way better for my taste. Small.  Right outside the elevators is Starbucks. No hiking a mile to get to one. Then you walk a pretty short distance to the restaurants. No confusion in how to find them. Completely smoke free building. No smoking anywhere!!!  Room was fairly basic but very comfortable and clean. Friendly staff and Gaga is in the building doing her jazz show. Highly recommend
30,It took over 1hour for a bellman to come up  Also it took even longer for someone to come and look @the phone. So many other issues I do not want to get into. I think the problems I had were not an issue.
10,The worst hotel on the strip very . The park mgm is very old and out dated. Just go spend your money somewhere else and thank me later. MGM as a hole is a good company but you will have a much better experience at another casino property
40,The Park MGM is conveniently located on the strip wonderful staff spa was wonderful clean rooms which are minimalist On tram line to Bellagio and walking distance to Aria by tunnel. A big plus is the Park MGM is smoke-free.
50,We had a great time at Park MGM. Really appreciated the non-smoking facilities. Staff was so friendly and helpful. Great food options everywhere you turned. We especially enjoyed the bar area in Primrose. Low key but very welcoming. Gaming area was very clean and wait staff circulated frequently. Carpet in hotel hallways could stand a refresh.
10,No mini fridge a/c sucks dark scary hallways. Charged for fees on a comped room. Food was not diverse at all no smoking casino. Not a lot of playback in the casino. Right outside the door with the outside escalator smelled like hot diarrhea outside.
50,Long weekend getaway to see BTS and shows. Great room and location to all events booked. Great staff and check in and out so convenient with app! It also your key! So convenient and less likely to get lost. And did I mention food?
30,I stayed here for 4 days. The location was good. Many places nearby that were walking distance. The room was nice overlooked the pool area. The iron that was in the room was damaged so it pulled a bunch of threads and ruined my shirt. They were quick to replace the iron but didn't seem too concerned about my ruined shirt. The bathroom was nice and a good size. When I started the shower the tub filled up. I had to repeatedly open and close the drain to get it to drain.  It was fun to be able to check in via the app and to access the room using the app. The WiFi was free but spotty. It was also difficult in places to access my own data.  The staff were all very friendly.
30,room was nice and clean  it is a smoke free environment  BAD : Wifi is terrible and unusable. I was charged for a item in the room that I didnt use. I called in 2 x to get it refunded and now I have to file a charge back. poor customer service. I also asked for extra towels for my room and was told I could only get 2 of the four I was asking for because she needed them for the other rooms. I keep getting distrub every morning even when the do not disturb sign was up on the door handle.
10,Roomservice was awful and obnoxious. They knocked at our door a total of 8 times while we were there-- including once while my partner was showering and opened the door as they were exiting the shower to answer and walked in on them nude. Absolutely unacceptable that you're so relentlessly obnoxious.
50,Would most definitely stay here again! Central location for food and attractions. Clean rooms and great hotel service. Loved the non smoking part of the entire hotel and casino. Great place to stay for the entire family!
50,the entire staff and venue were exceptional thank you for a great stay. i would definitely recommend this venue and consider staying here again. please keep up the hospitality here!! special shout out to Jonathan in VIP Services! what a rockstar thanks again!
50,We got free rooms for Friday and Saturday night using the Myvegas app games and resort fees were comped since we were MGM Rewards Gold member. So it was great for a free room. They are remodeled rooms so everything looks pretty new and clean. Good location in the middle of the strip. Wish there were better restaurant options but not too bad. I like that the whole resort is non-smoking. The pools were pretty decent too and the bartender by the pool makes the drinks pretty strong. No issues getting chairs too by the pool. The Nomad pool is quieter but it was windy and a bit chilly so we chose to stay downstairs by the jacuzzi.
40,Probably one of my top three favorite casinos on the strip just for the fact is non smoking. It’s also pretty lively and has a positive atmosphere. Only problem is there are limited food options so you may have to go across the street to find something with in a reasonable price.    The Rooms were mediocre but they weren’t intolerable by any means. still better than a lot of other hotels on the strip (luxor excalibur circus circus ect…)
50,We had a great stay at Park MGM to see Lady GaGa perform at Dolby Live and it was great to walk to our room afterwards! Digital key on my phone was very convenient and super cool! Will stay again! Highly recommended!
50,Excellent stay. Went to see Lady Gaga and it was great to be at the same hotel as venue. Ate and shopped at Eataly which was also delightful. We sat by the pool and the music could have been a little less loud but it wasn’t awful. We would stay here again.
40,First trip back to Vegas since covid. Wasn't expecting casinos to take advantage of the times to raise everything but here we are. Was not happy with how fast the table mins raised when a show ended or every vegas GameDay.
50,Loved the wide array of dining options. My Best Friend Eataly NoMad Library and Bavettes were all outstanding. Love the smoke-free hotel environment and secure elevators. Walkable to other great spots.
50,It was our first time staying at the Park MGM. What a pleasant surprise! Loved the atmosphere! It was a nice break from the strip. I felt safe staying here. This was a very easy resort/casino to navigate (also convenient ride share pick up/drop off). The pool area was very relaxing. It was nice to have a choice between the three pools (21+ adult and family). Our room overlooked T-Mobile arena and park area. It was easy to forget that we were in Vegas. The room was clean and a nice size. There were plenty of places to get something to eat or drink. We will definitely stay here again!
50,Overall great place to stay. Friendly and efficient front desk employees. Beds are comfortable. I wanted to change rooms to be close to people we were traveling with and they were very accommodating. The only thing I would change is in room bar fridge.
50,We are here in Vegas celebrating our anniversary and we were selecting some wines at Park MGM's Eataly wine shop. We got to chatting with Hank Graae a security guard there and he was exceptionally friendly helpful and made us feel safe welcomed and appreciated. Everything you would want from an employee representing your company. Eataly has become a favorite spot for us to visit (no smoking and excellent food and wine choices) and Hank made our experience that much better! Thank you so much! We will be back.
40,We enjoyed our stay very much. Major complaint: only one Restroom in the entire casino and it is WAY off to a corner near EATALY.  The hotel room was small but very clean; the shower was GREAT!  There was a wide variety of restaurants. We had a wonderful dinner in the Library; VERY good service with a nice selection entrees.  The casino was OK with almost NO video poker machines. Table stakes are ridiculously high but this is true of all Strip casinos. So happy this entire building is Non-Smoking.
40,Room was a little small compared to other I have stayed at but other than that it was a great experience easy to use mobile app everything was done electronically therefore did not have to wait in any lines for any thing. Will re-visit again
50,Upgrading to the $50/night food and beverage credit was worth it for us since we planned to eat at Best Friend LaLa Noodle and Eataly. Lots of other great dining & bar options as well. Hotel is tucked back from The Strip so is quieter which we enjoyed (great for older travelers or people not looking to party too hard!). The Brian Newman After Dark show was EXCELLENT. Loved that it was held in such an intimate venue (Nomad Library). We could have spent the entire trip at this hotel and still had fun - it has everything you need! We didn't use the pool but it looked intimate and peaceful compared to other hotel pool complexes. Rooms have a modern/minimal aesthetic which is our preference but don't come with the usual mini fridge (one can be requested for an extra fee). Black-out blinds were a nice touch and allowed us to sleep in after late nights out.
50,First time staying here (4 nights). Can't wait to try the pool & outdoor eating areas later this summer for our next mini-vacation. The Primrose restaurant menu was 5 star! Being seniors we used the tram often! We'll be back.
50,The location of the hotel was great. My complaint  2 people and only one chair why? We did bring our own coffee maker and snacks so we didn’t miss that early cup of “JOE “ that we needed to kick start our day… I still can’t believe only one chair. Joe
40,The staff was amazing check in and out was painless! Fabulous restaurants on site! Located around CVS and target was nice also. In addition it is a smoke free campus. If we go back to Las Vegas for a vacation I would stay here again.
50,We had a nice room. Great food. Lady Gaga was amazing. The Easter brunch at Primrose was very delicious. Kind of wish the good credit was for each of us. Everything in Vegas is expensive but we had a nice quick trip to see lady Gaga
50,I love the park!! Check in was the only issue. Waiting for rooms to get ready. Staff was great an helpful. Love this property being smoke free. Can't wait to get back. Rooms are clean along with the casino.
50,I love the Park MGM. It's a great hotel in a good location. I hate the $39 resort fee and $15 parking fees but otherwise the hotel is great. Stayed here before and the room that faces the arena had music playing all night and all day. this room facing the strip was much quieter.
50,Great service clean rooms and love love PrimRose! The staff on Easter Sunday was professional and friendly… thoroughly enjoyed the experience and will be back in the Fall. Also love Eataly.. wonderful Vino!
50,Great location and fun atmosphere. Room was clean. Only thing missing was a mini fridge which we would have liked. We went to buy waters but we didn’t have a fridge. Staff was helpful. Room was ready really early which was super nice!
50,The Park MGM is probably my favorite MGM property in Las Vegas. The staff are friendly yet very professional. They make it a priority that your stay is enjoyable. And as an added bonus the hotel & casino are totally “SMOKE FREE”
40,Smoke free was number one reason for choosing the Park MGM. For the most part was very pleased with the parking check in room and service.  two things I did not like.  1. There was no place in the bath room to put anything out of sight. Bathrooms should have draws for toiletries.  2. There was very little storage and very limited area for hanging clothes. You should be able to unpack your suitcases and hang your clothes.
50,Love that Park MGM is completely smoke free and it’s front entrance (Eataly) is absolutely beautiful! The staff was very friendly and helpful with anything we needed. Parking in garage in back was easy access
40,Great location and very friendly helpful staff. Nighthawk suite lacks a fridge but the room itself very clean. Could use a coffee table to kick up your feet. The main concern was the WiFi. Extremely slow and inconsistent. It was hard to get any work done. Front Desk gave me the option to pay for faster WiFi but what’s the resort fee for then?
50,Hotel was convenient for all the strip malls. The associates are all very helpful and friendly. The room was clean although the carpet are kinda dark I guess there’s a theme in every room and we happened to be on a red room. Otherwise the view was very nice.
50,Second time staying at this hotel. Friendly staff. Easy check in and out. Quit room and the cleanest hotel in vegas. I like that is the only non smoking hotel on the strip. Will definitely stay here again.
50,Smoke free casino wonderful steak restaurant and Eataly is amazing. Rooms are lovely as always. It;s a very convenient location. Walkable to several other hotels. This was my third or fourth trip and I have reservations to go back in September.
50,Always a fun stay at Park MGM. Clean smoke-free and a friendly helpful staff! Lots of dining choices. Conncted to the Dolby Live Theatre. What’s not to like? Our third stay within a year. We’ll continue to return.
50,The Park MGM Las Vegas is across the street from the T-Mobile Arena and next door to the NYNY as well. Walking distance to lots of restaurants and bars. Great service friendly staff and rooms are nice.
50,Great hotel and staff. Enjoyed the smoke free environment. The room was very clean and quiet. I was able to do most of my activities on site. The eatery has a great selection. The pool was very relaxing. Thank you
50,The Park MGM Grand is our First Choice Stay from now on. The Hotel smells magnificent and is sparkling clean and elegant. The staff is so professional and customer friendly. There are so many Dining Choices you do not want to leave. Most definitely will return to stay.
50,We had a very enjoyable stay at Park MGM. Check in was very easy on-line. We found hotel very clean and you could notice the smoke free environment as soon as you walked in. The hotel is central to other MGM properties and trams make it easy to get to other side of the strip. This was a fun pre-vacation getaway. Will definitely come back.
50,Great location. The hotel was lovely and I absolutely loved the fact that it was smoke-free. Having Eataly on site was a bonus. The staff was very friendly. I was here for business and would highly recommend the hotel for both business and pleasure.
50,So happy since they changed it to a non-smoking casino. Great selection of restaurants everything is good and Eataly Food Court is incredible. If you like to play cards the table selection is limited and minimum bets are high but the casino itself is really clean and the staff are great.
50,Wonderful experience. Everyone is so friendly and helpful. Rooms are nice just gets a little loud at times. No smoking is awesome! Everything is clean and fresh. Check in and check out extremely easy.
20,I rented two rooms at Park MGM. We had issues with a food allergy and they couldn’t brush us off fast enough. The bathrooms in both rooms had hair and dirt in the sink. The view of the strip (that I paid extra for and was told it was great) sucked I couldn’t see anything but MGM Grand
50,Nice hotel needed to be cleaned the second night we stayed and had no fridge but besides that everything was good. We want to go back to a Las vegas Raiders game soon. Hopefully we can go see more shows thanks!
50,I have been to the Park MGM hotel multiple times. Every time I enjoy my visit because it is a peaceful hotel compared to the other surrounding hotels. This hotel does not smell like smoke and I love it.
20,Park MGM is the old Monte Carlo….so smoke free and guest elevators right off the lobby we’re the highlights. The room was Motel 6. No closet. No drawers. One chair. Cheap soiled carpet. Non-draining tub. Sucky shower head. Bottom line not worth the jacked up prices we paid.
50,Staff was friendly in every aspect from checkin to maid service to parking attendant and gambling tables. But the reason I come back here is the bed. There has never been a hotel/AirBnb bed as fantastic as the beds here at Park MGM. Came back second just because of bed and will continue to come back here because of the bed.
50,Wonderful property. Loved that it was smoke free. Pool was great drinks were delicious great location on the strip. Eataly was unreal. The food on property was superior to many we’ve had in past visits to Vegas. Can’t wait to come back.
10,I checked into a hotel room that still had hair in the shower and was in general dirty. They changed my room and that one was also dirty. The sink was covered in shavings and there was pubes on the floor. One staff member in particular in the front desk was extremely rude and condescending. Maybe my experience is one instance but in general was not impressed.
50,Easy check in & out of rooms with Park MGM cell phone app and comfortable clean and relax full rooms! Casino also offers some great shows. With great location on strip to explore or attend T Mobile Arena just next door.
40,This resort is in a great location right on the strip. Eataly is an awesome experience. I saw Lady Gaga in the theatre and it was unforgettable. Can hardly wait to see Aerosmith later this year. Staff is friendly and the venue is very clean.
50,Always my favorite place. Super clean. Smoke free. Great food. If you're ever in Vegas the first place you should think to stay is here. Great location. Easy access to places like the M&M store. Casino staff is friendly and also Lady Gaga is at the Park
40,Awesome location great staff beautiful hotel with all the amenities and all at an amazing price. Just requires room updates but nothing major just looks a little dated. On-site restaurants bars pools are nice and the spa was great! Would stay again.
20,I used a third party to book and was just denied a room because the company directly charged the resort fee. That's a you problem not me...I can't believe they just told me to kick rocks and didn't even offer any help...
50,The location is great the dining options are all excellent check-in is smooth and we like the smoke-free casino. Would definitely go back. My only wish is that there was a coffee maker in the room.
50,We stayed in this hotel for a conference and I felt like I was sleeping on the clouds every night. The hotel had EVERYTHING that you needed and was conveniently located on the strip. I look forward to my next visit and 10/10 highly recommend for all conferences to be held at this hotel.
50,We travelled to Vegas for the BTS concert in April. Hotels were very expensive but because I was a MGM Rewards member the room rate was very reasonable. Our room was on the 21st floor overlooking the pool which we appreciated. Request a green room vs the red rooms the green rooms feel more spacious and soothing. I would not want to stay in a red room. Whenever we passed housekeeping they were so happy and friendly. It felt very welcoming. The non-smoking policy at the hotel is another reason I would stay here again as well as it didn't feel overly crowded in the lobby like some hotels (i.e. the Bellagio). Highly recommend this hotel!
10,Not Helpful if you booked through 3rd Party. I was told that I was going to get a complimentary upgrade because I accidententky booked a handicapped accessible room from American Express and to come to concierge then next morning between 9am-11am and they did nothing for me the following morning and they said they can not help clients who book with 3rd party companies who book at Park MGM there exact words at Concierge.
40,Coffee pot and mini fridge in rooms would have been nice! Casino was very clean as was room. No smoking was a plus for sure. Bartenders in the Casino were not very attentive or friendly. Pool area was very nice and clean!
50,I loved Park and Nomad. Very clean hotel and had a blast! The restaurants options were very good and On the Record was a fun night out while never leaving the hotel. Big fan of that! Friendly dealers and plenty of tables to enjoy.
50,Loved the location!! Room and bathroom was nice and staff was friendly. I loved the restaurants there and the fact that it was non-smoking. The Park felt clean fresh and still with lots to do. Loved being on the strip and close to so many things. Would stay there again!
50,Very lovely hotel set right in the middle of everything. Close to great shopping show venues excellent food and a smoke free casino!  Spent most of our time walking here and there and enjoyed all the different areas that seemed like an extension of our hotel. Wouldn't stay any where else!!
50,We had a king bedroom. It was very spacious. The bed was super comfortable. The shower was amazing- great water pressure with lots of space. The room darkening shades could be darker lol. The room lit up in the morning.
50,This was my second time at Park MGM Resort. My first good experience made me want to come back and this trip was better than the first. Exceptional staff and so kind and friendly even the room staff were amazing and fun. Great atmosphere for a solo or a group trip. Definitely recommend this place.
50,Very clean and a smaller hotel which I like. Comfortable beds and pillows. Clean updated rooms. Great views. Nice gym. Beautiful pool. Great food options. And everyone is very friendly and helpful. Great service. Love it here.
50,Great hotel. Free tram connecting to two other places. Entire hotel is Non smoking which is wonderful! Only complaint is the hotel room Bathroom doors didn’t have locks. And rooms don’t come with a Fridge.
50,We stayed at Park MGM for a girlZ weekend/birthday and have only the highest remarks. From the seamless check-in and out via the app - the app on your phone serves as a key to your room - to the many dining options cocktail lounges first rate casino and show venue Park MGM offers all the best Vegas has to offer in one convenient location. Best part about it? NO CIGARETTE SMOKE!!
50,Clean non smoking hotel and casino located at convenient location on the strip. There is a nice park located next to the property  there is no grass but plenty of trees and chairs and tables. The pool area is nice offering three pools and a hot tub  and two of the pools being 18 +
50,We will never stay anywhere else. The grounds are beautiful it’s very accessible the staff are INCREDIBLE the ambiance fantastic food/restaurants are top-notch—loved everything about it. Not even one drawback.
20,The staff was friendly and quick. The room however was dirty. A lot got overlooked. The sheets weren’t clean there wasn’t enough towels the sink was dirty the shower was dirty and there was a dirty hand towel let in the closet.the toilet paper and tissues were not restocked. I’ve stayed here before and loved it but it missed the mark this time.
50,We’ve stayed here twice now and both times have been great. Staff is friendly. Eataly food is delicious. Casino staff friendly. Smoke free is a plus plus plus. Only casino in Vegas totally smoke free. Planning another trip soon.
40,Only problem I had was that the restaurants were not open until mid week and caused us to look else where for food . I would have rather stayed in the property instead of venturing out to eat and have drinks .
50,I'm a Las Vegas local and like to stay at strip properties when I do a staycation. To coincide with our Lady GaGa concert we decided to stay the Park MGM. Rooms where simple but cute and very clean. The whole property is non-Smoking (INCLUDING THE CASINO) - Big Plush. Really great experience.
50,My wife and I travel to Las Vegas from Central California and average of three times out of the year. We have stayed at hotels on Fremont street and on the strip. MGM grand Luxor Circus Circus Excalibur and New York New York. Park MGM has been the best so far. Clean rooms great service and beds that make you feel like you are sleeping on a cloud. We felt at home and safe.
50,Blew into town to see Lady Gaga and had a blast. Especially love that the hotel is smoke free and parking is close/convenient! Staff was super friendly. Highly recommend the MGM rewards program and mobile check in.
50,overall had a great experience. Check in / check out process was easy and simple especially via the MGM App. Great location as we were able to walk to majority of our destination. Staff was friendly and rooms were nice.
50,The rooms were clean and wonderful. Enjoyed it and wish I could’ve stayed longer. It was a bit far from everything but still great. Food court was noice and the pool area. Hallways were a bit dark but have luxurious feel
50,First time staying at the Park MGM although I have stayed at a few other MGM Resorts. What really stood out was the smoke free environment. Hotel room was spacious and clean and very modern. Staff was courteous and attentive to our needs. Loved the pools and the restaurant & bars. Casino staff were easy to talk to and seemed to enjoy working there. Will go back to Park MGM again!!
50,I just wanted to give credit to a few table game employees here at the Park MGM. First is table game supervisor Ian O. He works the 4 am to 12 pm. Very friendly and makes you feel welcome. Meo dealer is also great. The 8pm to 4 am shift has Rick and Joe who are also dealers. They make the time fly by and we have fun even when losing. I've been coming to Vegas since the mid 90's and never met genuine people as listed above. I will review the hotel later but wanted to list the employee above. There are a few other dealers here that are excellent as well.
50,Enjoyed our stay in early April. The property is nicely renovated and clean. We stayed in a Nightingale Suite it was spacious with multiple sitting areas. The update has been done simply however for the price and location of this property it meets all expectations. Having a smoke free property with the addition of EATALY is awesome. Plenty of on site eating options and a spacious casino. Enjoyed that this property has an ABC convenience store across the street for more affordable drinks/snacks. No coffee in the room not a big deal with a Starbucks in the lobby or authentic Italian Coffee in EATLY. Pool is nice with plenty of space for guests. This is a great choice for Vegas would definitely return.
50,This hotel was very clean technology friendly and provided fast service. I downloaded the app and checked in online which was super simple. They have excellent safety measures by only allowing you to press the elevator floor button that you are staying on which means you cannot access any other floor. The only issue was elevator traffic (very busy) and that the online key card wouldn't always work the first couple of times especially in the elevator.
20,After using the link provided from BTS the room ended up NOT being included in the BTS themed room with some sort of glitch in their system—being the only one of my group somehow excluded from the themed room when booked from the same link and same time.    Found out not only did I not get the themed package I paid more for the rooms than my friends. I went to argue but they were NOT helpful and just rude. Plain rude-blaming me for not reserving the BTS room. And there was NOTHING BTS about the hotel when LV invited the BTS to come and some hotels joining in on the event. We had to go to other BTS included hotels to enjoy BTS theme.  Shame on you park MGM. VERRRRRRY DISAPPOINTING.  I will not return to this hotel again.
50,Could not be any happier choosing to stay at Park MGM. Everyone was so nice. The service was excellent. I’m not sure if it was because we were there for BTS and the vibe wa just so amazing. I really enjoyed staying there with my family for the BTS concert
50,Park MGM is a non smoking hotel and casino which is one of the things that made us want to stay there. The basic King room is a little small but we were only there to sleep so it wasn't a big deal. The full couch window seat was a nice and comfortable touch. Staff was amazing! Not a single problem with anyone. Also check out Hello Kitty Cafe nearby and Best Friend restaurant in the hotel (try the Slippery Shrimp! So good!) We also really loved the free tram to the Bellagio that was an awesome thing to discover! My husband had never been to Vegas so I tried to take him to every hotel that I thought had something cool in it. For the Bellagio I wanted him to see the Conservatory and the lobby ceiling. Oh also if you like Lady Gaga or just want to look at her costumes go to Haus of Gaga it's free to look at! So fun! We will stay here again next time we come to Vegas!
50,Park mgms staffs are definitely awesome. From checking in to checking out. From housekeeping to the shops! I love how comfortable the bed and pillows are! I had the best sleep so far with the help of the curtain? Lol I’m not sure what you call it but yeah! :)
50,Very nice rooms. Newly renovated and funky look. Nice Customer Service as well . I upgraded my stay and they gave me nice price on arrival . On request they provided me with refrigrated as well in room . Just pay a little and you get it . Nightingale suite very nice and spacious
40,The location is great right in the middle of the strip. Hotel was very quite and I liked the mobile check in and checkout plus your phone was your room key! The restaurants were busy but not from people but lack of staffing.
30,Hotel is smoke free but the truly scratchy bed sheets are a deal breaker. You should bring some sheets with you or suffer with the sand paper sheets. (I did not have sunburn if I did it would have been a complete nightmare).
40,Close Across Street  from T Mobile center not far from Alegiant stadium easy strip access  big casino great restaurants car rental at location easy elevator access large self park garage MGM Rewards .
40,Loved this hotel and the amenities. The Eatery is phenomenal and delicious. I was also very amazed that i was able to stay in the same place that Lady Gaga has her residency. Seeing Gaga perform her jazz & piano show was the absolute highlight of this trip. The Dolby Live Theater is spectacular and sooooo special.
50,Came for a massive event. The hotel has digital keys for both the room and parking (that is good for in and out privileges and at any MGM affiliated hotel parking!). There’s a tram that brings you to city center and Bellagio for free which made traveling to the middle of the strip convenient. Rooms were typical w stand up showers and access to floors and elevators were only allowed w room key—so it felt safe and secure. I do wish they had some kind of shuttle service to airport or stadium
50,We stayed 2 night on our way to Zion. The park is the only place I will stay in vegas due to it being smoke free. The rooms are amazing parking was easy. I used the app for everything parking room key everything.
20,Don’t stay at this hotel they over charge and don’t want to help you when you ask. The rooms are plain they have no amenities the spa jacuzzi was broken restaurants closed tables were all $15+ minimum bets and they over charged us.
50,Very clean hotel and casino. Staff friendly. Pool great definitely go in the afternoon with the way the sun hits. Only bummer was there was no fridge in the room to store snacks or left overs. Be sure to go ahead and just get a hard copy of room key. Virtual key is a great idea but you lose service in elevators so it wouldn’t work half the time. Overall great place to stay.
40,Hotel was clean staff was friendly. Restaurants were delicious. Loved that it was non smoking. Pools were wonderful. The only thing is if coffee shop was open at 6 instead of 7 and 1 restaurant open later even if only snacks..
50,We had an amazing time at Park MGM. The staff was very friendly the rooms were clean we loved the pool and the food was so good! The only downfall to us is the location. We would love to be more center strip but it wouldn’t stop us from staying here again.
20,The carpets in the hallway were very dirty and the rooms were dusty. The check in app did not work and the staff was not very helpful. They were not able to find my reservation only after someone had to check again
30,The total for 3 nights literally turned into double what I booked online the resort fee was ridiculous. The bed was a pretty cheap king mattress so the sleep wasn't all that great. Also I had 3 other family groups staying there in their own rooms and they had trays of snacks to purchase...our room did not.
10,They advertise a lazy river and wave pool. They have removed both. I would not go back and I would not recommend Park MGM to anyone.    Our children were beyond devastated by their deceptive marketing practices.
50,Was there for a conference! The rooms were great comfy bed great views and location! Loved the Little Italy eating area to grab food/drinks! And the Best Friend restaurant I highly recommend! Would definitely stay again!
50,We had stay here previously but as we keep coming back the resort just keep getting better. Carlos the bar tender is always willing to help us in our drinking needs. The restaurant are great however if you don’t have reservations be ready to wait for a while for a table.
50,Check-In was easy with online/in-app check-in. The room was clean and staff was very helpful and nice. The security of needing a key for the corresponding floor of your room was an added sense of security for a solo traveler. The smoke-free environment was a great perk for a non-smoker. Checkout was fast simple and very user friendly. Will definitely book here again!
50,Park MGM just has a warm and friendly environment. This place does not disappoint from front desk to cleaning crew. The rooms are extremely clean and spacious. I also love the showers they are spacious and the water pressure is perfect. Thank you Park MGM see you in the summer.
30,Service was amazing. Close to a lot of things. But room wasn’t as clean. There was old underwear behind to sofas not vacuumed shower had hair from previous person (we don’t have that type of hair that was on the shower floor) and got me thinking of the bed sheets were even clean but other than that everything was satisfactory
50,It was our fist time in Vegas and I wanted to stay at a big name casino. After a lot of research I landed on the Park MGM. I had considered many others but this one had 2 features that sold me:    1. The entire casino and hotel are nonsmoking and I'm very sensitive to smells due to allergies  2. It has Eataly    We parked in the ramp right next to the hotel there was plenty of parking and we paid $15 for one night. We tried the online checking by scanning a QR code but that process was taking forever and it wasn't working (didn't give us a room number) so we had to check in the old fashioned way (should have done that from the start). Once we got to the check in desk the process went super smooth.    We got to our room and we happy to see it had a nice view out over the pool. The room was quiet couldn't hear people in the halls. The bed was very comfy. After settling in we went out for the night.    This hotel is connected to other casinos by the tram. It's a long walk to the tram stop but it's very handy to have.    The casino seemed very clean when we were there. No room for social distancing on nights when there are big events going on and no one wears masks so just be aware of that if it concerns you.    We enjoyed breakfast at Eataly got some pastries and had fun walking around exploring their shop. Early in the morning there aren't many checkout lanes staffed so you have to take your purchases to the pastry shop. We love Eataly and have been to several other locations. The Las Vegas one lived up to the standard. We also had gelato and a charcuterie board both were very good and made us feel like we were in Italy. Great place highly recommend you check it out if you can.    Checkout was smooth contactless and before we knew it we were back on the road.
50,This hotel wasn't only situated perfect on the strip for my trip it had the overall vibe I was looking for. The staff were all welcoming helpful and eager to make my experience the best. All the restaurants looked so appealing I want to come back to experience them all soon.
50,We had a wonderful time. The room was great the staff was friendly and the food was incredible! We stayed at park MGM because it was smoke free and we were so glad we did. The location is perfectly situated on the strip too!
50,It was a last minute stay. We ended up with a great room. Bed was large and comfortable. Staff were helpful and friendly. Booked through the MGM app and saved half. For the price we had the option of staying at the Motel 6 or the Park MGM we chose the better option. Couldn't be happier with our selection.
50,I travel alone and am 65. I feel so safe staying here. Every staff member are always so nice and kind!  I really like the location so accessible to the park across the street. I love access to the free bellagio tram within the hotel.
20,Was more than disappointed at the service and cleanliness of our room. Wouldn’t stay here again. Quality of housekeeping has definitely gone down. Won’t be coming back to Vegas rather stay at an Airbnb
30,The hotel didn’t guarantee that we would receive housekeeping everyday. Also there are some issues with their system with linking of hotel bookings on consecutive days. The rooms are generally fine shower had good water pressure.
30,The Park MGM is in a great location. It is clean and Eatly is fun to explore. The pools and pool area are maintained and fun to relax at. We enjoyed using the pool at the MGM Grand across the street as well. While the majority of the stay was above average the walls are thin and very little will be done if you have noisy neighbors.
50,The hotel had amazing options for dining out. Eataly is a must! The speakeasy is a photo op every turn you make & a really good DJ played while we there there. The housekeeping staff was so attentive & kind. I’ll def stay here again.
40,The room is minimal but clean. We enjoyed the non-smoking facility. Eataly offers great variety of food. Parking is free if you signed up MGM Rewards or own the M-Life Mastercard otherwise is $15. Will definitely come back next time.
50,Went on a whim. Was just like an all inclusive resort. Never had to leave the hotel. I was able to gamble. Wife was able to enjoy the pool and sun. Many dinner options within. We’re going back soon to have fun!!
50,Very convenient clean and many options for in house dinning. Good value and walking distance to the Tmobile arena and bars. Room and bathroom were clean and a good upgrade for standard rooms. Could have a fridge in the room though.
10,Bathroom was dirty upon arrival I counted over 40 pubic hairs on ground hairs in sink on walls… disgusting! I had to change rooms to another one that was *less dirty*.    Housekeeping did not clean my room for 2 out of 4 nights I stayed. When I called to ask about it they said sorry we’re short handed - but am I not paying a daily rate for daily service???    Front desk male staff member (possibly Hispanic? Or Mexican?) with darker skin glasses beard was VERY RUDE and had terrible customer service.    On a day a housekeeper actually showed up they knocked over the snacks on the weighted mini bar and then I got charged for that.    Towels were old some stained had holes in them and felt rough like rags. Very low quality.    Items in room (like the phone) were bought from China and falling apart.    The price paid nightly plus resort fees does not match the service received/ quality of products in room were very low. At the end wit came out to over $200 a night when you include the resort fees daily parking fees. But the hotel room was definitely not worth that. I had a way better experience with Planet Hollywood last year.    The bed just had flat sheets instead of a duvet or comforter also no fitted sheet which exposed dirty stained mattress pad below.    Hotel penny pinches every little thing treating guests as dollar signs instead of caring about guests needs.. Want to park? That costs extra per day. Want a fridge? That costs extra too.    Oh and don’t forget to bring your ear plugs if you want to get sleep! We could hear our neighbors TV on all night and you can hear when someone upstairs opens their curtains or anyone nearby flushes their toilet
50,Ulises at front desk was very nice and helpful. Our stay was nice and the location was great! The casino is smaller compared to other hotels and the dealers at the casino can be rude. We had a bad experience with one of the casino workers because we had our daughter walking through the casino. I took food to my father that was playing and my husband and daughter stayed on the walk way to wait for me when the casino employee came up to my husband started yelling at him and threatened to call security. We didn’t get a chance to say anything because she would not let us talk.
50,Great hotel clean great staff and No smoking allowed in casino. Made the stay that much better. The restaurants in the hotel are amazing also. Def will only be staying at Park MGM when i come back to vegas
50,Loved staying here for the BTS concert! The location was perfect for our trip. So close to the airport (15mins) and Allegiant stadium (we were able to walk back after the concert! Loved the pool (boutique and nice vibe). Was able to make a reservation at Best Friend. Easy self check in and out and digital key options!
40,I stayed at the Park MGM for 4 nights for the BTS concerts at Allegiant Stadium + touristy stuff and it was great! I was deciding between the Bellagio Park MGM and Flamingo with a strip view but ultimately chose Park MGM based on the location being non-smoking and the price.    Check-in: Easy using the mobile app. Tip is to put an early estimated arrival time so you can possibly get your room earlier for no extra charge. And if you didn't put an earlier time go to the front desk and ask if the room is ready if it is they can bypass it so you can get access to your room right then and there.    Location: Very convenient on the strip and close to everything. Super easy access to the Aria-Bellagio tram. And driving to/from the Allegiant Stadium Area 15 and downtown is a breeze. Walking to/from Allegiant Stadium is doable too we walked back for D2.    Lobby elevators escalators: I really like how there weren't crowds of people in the hotel like it is at others like the Bellagio. It does get busy during check-in and check-out times and when there are nearby events but even then we could still move through swiftly. There was an issue with the elevator one morning where only 2 was working but they seemed to be aware and on it.    Parking: Easy to find a spot and the walk-way bridge isn't bad. Self-parking is only $15 per night. A plus with staying at a MGM hotel is you can use the same parking barcode on the app to park at other MGM hotels. We used this to park at Mandalay Bay for lunch.    Non-smoking: Huge plus! Once you go in the hotel you can smell how good it is. Definitely book here if you are not a fan of cigarette smells that is prevalent at other hotels.    Room: I had a standard 2 Queen room that was booked using a myVEGAS 1 night comp and 3 night stay using the MGM members 30% off spring sale rate. A few days before I arrived I called them to link the two reservations and they did it with no issues. I had requested a room on a high floor with a nice view and away from the elevator in the notes section of the reservations. They definitely delivered! We were on the 27th floor in room 334 and this room was all the way at the end of the hallway. Bed and couch was comfy and I like how I could set the room temperature down to 60 degrees. There is no mini fridge or microwave. We brought a cooler and filled it with ice. The room had the red decor. TBH the interior design and furniture is kinda dated and the hallways felt dungeon-like and doesn't really match the rest of the quality of the property. If they updated those that would elevate the experience even more. The view for this room was of the T-Mobile Arena Allegiant Stadium and NYNY.    Bathroom: Good water pressure. Clean. They had a hair dryer. They have a note card on the rack that says if you want to reuse your towels to leave it hanging up but if you want fresh ones to put them on the floor. I wasn't a fan of their toiletries (odd scent and texture) glad I brought my own.    Cleanliness: There were spots that wasn't clean like the carpet between my bed and the room temperature control was very dusty carpet stains and some dirty marks on the walls. Otherwise it was fine.    Noise: We could hear neighbors closing their doors but no other noises from them. The T-Mobile Arena is right in front so when they have an event the bass is bumping and can be heard/felt in the room. Thankfully that was only during the afternoon-evening for 2 days of our stay.    Staff: The front desk guy (Doug?) was friendly and helpful. Also the lady at the MGM rewards desk was nice too!    Resort fee: Didn't get to check out the fitness center TBH we didn't even know where it was and forgot it was one of the amenities hahaha. One bummer was the WiFi was spotty and we couldn't access it at all on Friday night.    Things to visit: Make a reservation at Best Friend! Food is excellent and worth the price. And go see the Haus of Gaga Las Vegas where you can see her iconic costumes. Also Silk Sonic performs at the Dolby Live so there are 2 cute picture taking spots. :)    Check-out: Super easy through the mobile app and dropping off the keys in the box by the front desk.    Overall it was a great stay! The hotel felt safe clean and worth the price. I'm glad I chose Park MGM I would come back. :)
50,Park mgm is absolutely wonderful. They have great options to eat. The beds & room are comfortable & cozy. The staff is friendly & professional. Great location! Highly recommended. The hotel & rooms were clean & welcoming!
50,You want friendly and helpful staff stay at the Park MGM! You wanna have fun and location is prime stay at the Park MGM! The best yet!!! Go check out there casino the restaurants and the gym great place to stay!!!
50,I love that this resort is a non smoking facility. It smell fresh and pleasant when you want into the lobby. A friendly attendant approaches you to help you check in and I never had to wait.  The room is clean and the beds are very comfortable. Eataly have lots of options for snack food and drinks.Definitely a great experience! Thank you!
50,Love the non smoking casino. Ate at Best friend again and it was even better than the first time I was there. Love the location so you can get anywhere that anything is happening on the strip. Even took in a hockey game right out the back door. Super convenient.
50,I loved the location and accessibility to where I wanted to go on the strip. So easy to walk to many places. The resort was nice and the room was comfortable. I liked that I was able to use the pools at the MGM Grand since it's the same resort. I had an issue with parking charges but they were able to resolve it and adjust as necessary. Very efficient service.
50,Stopped by Eataly at the MGM park for a bottle of wine. Hank in security also happens to be a sommelier- he recommended a fantastic wine to us and was so helpful. Always wonderful to meet someone so knowledgeable about wine and willing to help without judgment!
50,Loved it way better than expected will diffently go again will tell family and friends of the stay I had and how they should go the staff is amazing please go and do yourself a favor this place is so wonderful
30,Planned a 3-night trip for my son’s 6th bday. Granted I had a few special request to have adjoining rooms and to be closer to elavator due to having a kid and parent with me on this trip - we felt we the hotel could have made the trip more enjoyable with pre-requested accommodations. We ended up arriving to check-in and had to switch multiple rooms due to condition and proximity. The last room (could had been first room) we moved to was in better condition and location. Unfortunately it had a clogged sink we had to have plumber clear and a running toilet which we lived with for 3 nights. I wasn’t about to uproot and move into another room again.
50,Clean non smoking hotel staff and check in service was phenomenal. Pool cabana was fun. Not overcrowded but still lovely. Pool bathrooms clean. Slept like a baby. My room was so chic and very clean. Thank you
40,Park Mgm location was great and yhe tram service to the Aria and Bellagio was amazing. But although the room was nice and big the lay out was very strange. They separated the foyer with a wall and a huge closet. I feel like they should of just made 2 rooms. It was certainly big enough. The stand up shower was amazing but a jet tube would of been great as well
50,The Park MGM is easy to find great location friendly staff. A great stay there would do it again. The food was very good. The casino was clean and well-staffed. Didn't have to drive anywhere to see attractions nearby.
50,Love that Park MGM is smoke free - nice rooms - good staff - nice sports book and loved Lu who helped us setup online betting thru MGM online betting. Good food choices and great pool! I can't wait for my next visit to Park MGM!!!
50,We have stayed here multiple times and enjoyed all the services and personnel. My favorite place to eat at Park MGM is Eataly. Accessible to many places on the strip. We will be back again and again as we enjoy staying there.
50,We found this hotel to be beautiful and quietly sedated compared to others in such a prime location on the strip. The Eataly is a fun concept and we love Lady Gaga’s little museum off the casino. The casino is an added bonus!!
50,I was disappointed in my MGM REWARDS program but not the hotel. The hotel is clean and NON SMOKING  so that's amazing. Had two pool days which was very relaxing and the service was good. This really is a great place to go especially if you don't smoke.
20,The stay was disappointing. The location is great and the hotel is clean-ish. Our room had stains on the floors and walls. Doesn’t matter if you’re a Hyatt member. They don’t honor any of the benefits that you carry. Loved that it was smoke free.
50,I’ve been in Vegas plenty of times however this was my first March Madness visit. Coupled with St Patty’s Day the city was buzzing. Looking forward to my next visit.    Park MGM is a great stay with perfect strip location. The betting kiosks made wagering easy. I love Aria which is right next door.    We spent Thursday at AmeriCAN which is near the Linq. Cool bar with a great location.
40,Excellent front desk service. Room and hotel is very clean and smells amazing. The o my complaint I have is the room key on the phone because the internet was not the best in the hotel so I had to get out of the elevator a few times because my phone wouldn’t go through in the Elevator. Other than that love the hotel and would definitely stay there again.
50,What an awesome hotel. Pleasant and professional staff. Comfortable rooms and spacious too. The casino has TV's around so we were able to watch the games and enjoy March Madness. The restaurants were good as well done too pricey but good was delicious
40,We like the smoke-free environment and the welcoming atmosphere. Bavette Steak House is the absolute best. We will stay there again. I miss having a poker room and a VIP room but overall the Park is a good selection.
50,We had a perfect and enjoyable stay at Park MGM. My family and I definitely look forward to booking another reservation soon. Entire hotel and our room well kept. The environment was exceptionally wonderful.
50,The Park was close to the event which was fantastic. I saw Silk Sonic. I really liked that the hotel was at the beginning of the strip so we did not have to travel the whole strip to reach our destination.
40,Bed and all furniture in the room.. too low to the ground.. hard to stand up .. bed was lumpy... Weird poor lighting in the room... But overall.. the non smoking aspect was the clincher casino good..
50,Nice hotel room was clean and staff was very friendly. Very convenient location across from TMobile arena as well. Nice to be on the strip as well. Made for a very fun getaway! I would definitely book again.
50,The hotel was very clean and comfortable. I like the location and free parking that comes with my rewards membership level. The showers are the best on the strip! Plenty of elevators so no long wait. Convenient check in process with the app. Monorail allows convenient travel to Aria and Bellagio.
50,Husband’s first time had a great time. Renovations were beautiful. Loved the pool and the restaurants. Had a great time playing slots won some lost some had a lot of laughs. Perfect location on the strip.
40,The hotel is in a great location. We really enjoyed our stay but I wouldn't consider it a 4-star hotel. The rooms were clean though and the ambiance was nice. We enjoyed dinner at Best Friends restaurant and would recommend it to others!
50,Fantastic! The staff was friendly and attentive. The room was clean and spacious. Plenty to keep you busy right here. Shopping eating entertainment and gambling This is my second time staying here.  Love it!!
50,We were very gratified to stay at a totally NON SMOKING casino hotel. The staff was exceedingly friendly in the lobby and in the casino. The person who booked us by phone was cordial understanding and efficient. Self Parking was easy. The location on the strip is ideal.
50,Love the keyless entry and digital check in. Convenient clean and smoke free. Great conference room across from the guest room elevators plus the Starbucks coffee. Only complaint is that the coffee served by the hotel can be improved for the long conferences. But the meals themselves were excellent.
50,Great place to stay nice location and room was perfect. The casino is smoke free (I think the whole hotel is smoke free). There is also a tram to Bellagio so that or walk outside in the heat. Parking is not included but decent at $15/day (note this is right next to T-Mobile arena so if there is an event parking may be difficult).
50,Easy check in/check out process. Friendly staff. Centrally located near convenience stores for water n other refreshments. Only negative thing was you will need to make reservations to eat at restaurant (but this was for most businesses in vegas not just hotel)
50,The hotel is a perfect safe for family that have kids it’s completely smoke-free and the smell of hotel is pleasant. I would definitely come back to this hotel for everything. Hospitality is on point!
40,"Overall a nice stay. Would be nice to have water bottles given as part of daily resort fee. Not really ""luxury"" for the price tag. Rooms are small and not enough towels. Bed pillows were too chunky. Location is fine."
50,Stayed at Park MGM in April 2022. The room was nice and the hotel is really central. The staff was accommodating and friendly. I am really happy with my stay and will for sure book again with Park MGM for my next visit in Las Vegas.
20,Will not plan to stay again. Unclean room with an un-fresh smell. A number of Staff are unfriendly especially the Bell Man/Lady. First Bell Man when we arrived is very arrogant about the tip. Bell Lady who brought our bags up is impolite un-respectful cranky never smiled don’t know how to say Thank You and visibly irritated. Not sure if she’s mad at someone or doesn’t like her job.
10,Only good thing about the hotel was that it was smoke free. Checked into a dirty room. A/C constantly turned off and front desk was notified with no change. Moved us to a new room with same A/C problems. Was given a good and beverage credit but didn’t explain how it worked so when we went down to the hotel shop to use it for drinks and snacks was told after we charged to the room that it only worked at the restaurants. Stayed in the Nomad portion of the hotel and was not impressed. Also located at the farther end of the strip. Do not have wate your money on this hotel. Very outdated and old.
40,Pleasant stay. Would go again if it continues to be cheaper than other hotels of a similar level amd above. Not the best of MGM but it was much better than I expected for the cheaper pricepoint. Great if you want to go around vegas rather than mainly stay in one resort.
30,Rooms were clean and relatively quiet but the resort fees and the parking fees are very high the lack of a decently priced sit down restaurant is problematic the service in casino was good but I think they could use a little more variety in machines
50,Park MGM was fantastically located on the strip. Hotel is non smoking which really I appreciate since I’m a non-smoker in Vegas. Hotel was clean and staff were helpful and friendly. Would definitely stay here again and would highly recommend.
50,No smoking anywhere casino outdoor pool restaurants you name it. The casino is nice size the pool area is massive and beautiful. The 3 pools and a hot tub were a pleasant reprieve. Comfortable chairs with shade or sun were plentiful.. Plenty of elevators with very little wait. We tried several of the restaurants and didn’t venture out much because of my current back issue. Convenient location on the South end of the Strip. We took an $18 Uber from the airport and a $12 Uber to The Mirage for a show. But they have an Italian Eataly Asian American Mexican Primrose Breakfast place Steakhouse Specialty Chicken Sports bar Starbucks an another coffee shop dessert places and numerous bars snack and gift shops.    My wife said the rooms are very minimalist and that’s a good word. The only furniture are the bed a closet area that has four drawers inside a built in couch under the window and a table with one chair. It’s a nice chair but there’s only one a little odd. The bed was comfortable but low to the ground even for my 5’2” wife. Bathroom was also simple very small counter around the sink vanity a shower and toilet. But one thing it has that most resort bathrooms don’t is a shaving mirror. I come back from most trips and an appalled by how bad I look.    The staff was friendly and eager to point you in the right direction we asked for a room near the elevator and that helped limiting my steps. Players club staff was friendly and helpful. Drink girls at the pool and casino were nice always around and returned quickly.
50,Excellent drinks at the bar great games that pay out great restaurants and location. The pools could be better though nothing special about them. But It’s a very nice and. Clean casino with nice staff and guests.
50,Excellent food casino and hotel. Love the smoke free atmosphere. Pools and jacuzzi were very nice. Wish they were open longer especially for a late night soak. The slots were varied and fun to play.
50,The smell that meets your nose when you walk in is divine! The check in area is beautiful and the pads are easy to check in on. Rooms are clean beds are comfortable! Lots of pillows that were so comfortable a few of us were tempted to take them! Good lighting for makeup(a nice magnifying mirror)  Well cleaned room and bathroom!
20,I decided to stay an extra night and changed properties from where I was staying. I’ve always wanted to try the Park MGM. The building looks nice from the outside so I decided to take a chance. I checked in online and received a digital key. I usually prefer a high floor in Vegas and was assigned the 4th. After I got off the elevator I was met with dark and depressing hallways. The worse part was the room. It was so small and poorly decorated. The view out the window was of other roof tops and a metal ladder. The bed was uncomfortable as well. I felt as if I was staying in a cheap off strip motel. The shower pressure was amazing.
50,Had a great overall experience and wouldn't hesitate to stay here again. My family also loved everything you had to offer. They also would stay with you again. Thank you for treating us like we're your family
50,We love the convenience and perfect location of the Park MGM each time we are in town for a Knights game. Smoke free and easy to get from airport to your room. No walking thru the entire casino. Never stay anywhere else
50,I think I've found my new favorite place on the strip. Park MGM is just a few minutes walk to several amazing sights and restaurants and a quick tram ride to the Crystals Shoppes Aria and Bellagio. Not only that it's a beautiful hotel with amazing staff and to top it off- it's a non-smoking casino! I loved everything about my stay and will most definitely book a room at Park MGM the next time I'm in Vegas!
40,We were there for a volleyball tournament. We loved that it is a smoke free casino / hotel which is great for kids but the room hallways are dark and the pool closed too early so there was no outdoor sitting anywhere. The room with strip view was not very worthy but got to see some lights from far. We like eating at Eataly and La La Noodles they were both great.
50,Check in was easy location is perfect hotel was clean. Cigarette smoke affects me greatly so a smoke free environment was a nice change in Vegas. The Uber pick up location was very convenient. We had to check out at 4:30 am so the self checkout computer was quick and easy to use.
50,This was a great place to stay right on the strip with tons of good stuff close by! Also food and room service was absolutely to die for!!! That alone made the stay worth it! We will definitely stay there again!!
50,Very nice and clean. Pool was great prompt service. Rooms are nice and clean. We had fun in sports lounge watching UFC fight great service and the food at Eataly was yummy. Can’t wait to come back and bring our friends💓
30,The hotel was centrally located. The casino was very small but the plus was non smoking. The rooms are modern but basic and do not have a fridge. I would avoid room service Way-over priced for the quality of food.
50,Great Value Except for Resort fees which are obviously unnecessary. The air inside is amazing compared to almost any other casino hotel in Vegas due to the non-smoking policy. Great beds and lots of pillows as well!
50,My flight got cancelled at 5:30 am.  I was able to book on line and be back to the hotel ordering room service within the hour. Great understanding folks. Got me in early by having me upgrade to an available suite.)  Much appreciated!  Mahalo!
50,Room was large and very comfortable. All staff we encountered were knowledgeable and friendly. Brewster in security department helped with a minor issue and was fabulous. I would recommend and plan on staying here again
20,Furniture is worn and stained. Walls are paper thin. We could hear our neighbors’ snoring their conversations and their bodily functions. There’s a 1/2 inch gap underneath the door(s) between adjoining rooms (we could see light underneath from the other room). Saturday brunch at NoMad Bar was good. Location is great. And I appreciate that the rideshare pickup area is close to the guest elevators. But overall I can’t recommend this property and I will not stay here again.
50,Great energy nice room really accommodating staff. Pool was calm and fun and there are some bars and restaurants right on the property. We loved the location as well felt in the center of everything. Would stay again!
50,First time stating at an MGM property I usually stay at Caesar’s properties but they changed me over. Clean room smoke free friendly staff good eating options. This is the fancier and more upscale version of the Paris hotel and casino.
10,Terrible unsatisfied and unprofessional. Got to do better then this and stop telling people one thing and then it’s another. I won’t be coming here again and because I basically feel like I got robbed of my money and that’s not oh okay at all.
50,We came for a volleyball tourney. I liked this hotel because it is one of the only hotels that is smoke free. It is a failry new hotel and is located near the NewYork - New York and MGM. Its proximty to these hotels is a plus. It has some nice eating options although in my opinion it could have a wider selection of breakfast options. It did have a 1 breakfast place inside of the Eatly and then you could sit down for breakfast at the Primrose but that is really it. Nonetheless i would stay here again because of the value and proximity.
40,Clean friendly but just out of date with no refrigerator. The people were great and very helpful and the gambling dealers were also helpful teaching me how to play different games. Even thought I did not leave with more money than I brought it was a ton of fun!!
30,Cons: (1) Room was not as comfortable as expected - towels and sheets were thin and scratchy mattress wasn’t comfortable room didn’t look as shown in photo on website; (2) Mobile check-in didn’t work as expected on app and the in person check-in line was long.  Pros: Excellent location at southern end of strip short distance to airport
20,Creepy old decor smelly halls broken/faulty elevators unattended barking dog rude employee difficulty checking in/out. Good location casino alright. Glad it was non smoking. Eataly downstairs was good for breakfast and dinner. Shower has good water pressure. Overall not a great stay but it was somehwere to sleep. Nice view on the 27th facing mgm grand.
50,This is the only smoke-free big hotel on The Strip and you definitely notice. My eyes stung in every other place. Eataly is a revelation. As is Best Friend. Love my stay so much! I ate in every restaurant. Would absolutely go back.
50,We found Park MGM to be a comfortable and convenient place to stay to enjoy time in LV. The room was attractive with a comfortable bed and a partial view of the strip; our room faced T Mobile Arena. It is the perfect location for attending Vegas Knights games and easy access to nice restaurants. Across the street is the Hard Rock Cafe and the FlyOverVegas “ride”. We enjoyed our “ride” over the Wild Wild West! Loved that! We enjoyed breakfast at the Primrose restaurant on the Lobby level of the ParkMGM; Eggs Benedict was delicious!!
50,Our stay here was very nice and made simple due to staff and being located next to T Mobile arena. We were greeted out front and brought over to VIP for check in for a quick process. The room had a great view also.
20,Bathroom and room were dirty. Hairs in the sink and shower. Hallways are dark with low ceilings carpets in the elevators are filthy. The staff is friendly although you don't interact with them much as everything is automated. It's well located with a convenient walk or tram to other hotels.
50,Definitely recommend friends & Family for their future stay. I must say stay was peaceful n enjoyable. No crowd at all. Very convenient close to Airport n strip where you can walk n visit local restaurants n drug store for emergency supplies like water .
50,We originally wanted to be a couple of blocks north but so glad we chose the Park! Restaurants were great staff was friendly and helpful. We explored 12 other resorts and most smelled like smoke or perfume or both - yuck! Good thing I had a mask!
10,The service was terrible. So terrible in fact that this is my first time writing a review. The Bell desk did not care about our issues and were not helpful at all. I had to force them to look into an issue with our room and they didn't even apologize once they found out they were in the wrong.
50,Park MGM has all the variety you expect in slots and places to dine. The best feature is the non-smoking casino and that is the main reason we stay there although the other MGM properties are great too.
50,Liked the rooms and the no smoking casino and Eataly!! Check in was easy valet was easy and check out was also easy. Love all the choices of food and taking the tram to other hotels. Too cold to go to pool
20,The corporate culture is becoming less and less customer oriented. Gearing more towards conventions than the occasional out of town gambler coming to Vegas. The best thing this place has going for it the morning craps crew. Super friendly and fun. I enjoy them even when i lose.
40,This is my favorite property in Vegas it’s a breath of fresh air compared to the rest of the strip. I love that it is nonsmoking staff are friendly and location is pretty good. Has a super convenient tram stop to bellagio. Great variety for food and drink options and the pool has an 18+ area. My only complaint is the beds I’ve stayed at Park and Nomad and the beds were on the firm side.
10,The room is very dusty the moment you enter the room you will start sneezing - exacerbates your allergies shower room filty with black circle mark from water that so not drain and you shower with your feet soaking from the water - seems like the room was sitting for days and accumulated dust and dirt and was not cleaned prior to our arrival. Giving clients comp for food and drinks do not fix the problem.
50,This property is refreshing change! No words for how much we enjoy a smoke free atmosphere everywhere including poolside! The onsite restaurants won't disappoint Overall this property is a joy. Thank you Park MGM
50,If you were a m life We were told you need to spend $20000 to stay active every year which is not acceptable I am a member of M LIFE because of the free parking is it when your pearl member  Food at the heater is pretty good very expensive watch out the clerks overcharged us on our food multiple times then when it’s time to check out it’s a big hassle to get straightened out overall park mgm room is an average hotel
40,Wouldn't try to eat at the breakfast spot couldn't get greeted for the life of me. However everything else was good! Please greet you're guests accordingly even when it's not busy other than that was a great stay!
50,I absolutely recommend this hotel for any occasion. It well maintained smoke free staff we're friendly. It looked super fancy but did not come with a fancy price. Love it I will be booking here again for all of our vacations in the future.
50,Best hotel in Vegas! Only Non-smoking hotel close to good eats at New York New York and bridge access close to cross Vegas blvd. Short walk to Aria through path and tram to Bellagio great central hotel with a great feel and great staff. Three pool options and close to elevators.
20,I could not believe all the trash left on the table. Haven’t seen that before. The carpeting outside the rooms is an old ugly green color that is coming up.The main floor is beautiful.  The food for our convention was very good and the staff was super friendly.  My bathroom also had a consistent stink about it.
50,We loved our accommodations at Park MGM. The room was nice clean and spacious! The hotel itself was right in the middle of the strip which made it possible for my mom(who’s knees are set to be replaced later this year) to get around and sightsee. We also enjoyed the numerous eateries onsite and of course it was amazing that we didn’t have to walk far to see Silk Sonic in concert.
50,Non smoking. Great food. Easy to access airport and other on strip activities easily. We have stayed here the last 3 trips to Vegas. No major concerns with any part of the stay. Friendly knowledgeable and very accommodating staff.
50,"Great stay for my bachelor's party. Nice clean and spacious rooms. Even without a ""strip"" view room I had a great partial strip view. Casino was great made more money off the MGM Grand tho. Friendly staff and that's what matters."
40,Although the draw of a smoke free facility is phenomenal the Wi-Fi was never strong enough to carry out even loading e-mail. Constantly disconnecting what was the point of the resort fee if the fee is supposed to supply the Wi-Fi. And switching to mobile data forget it. Never had cell service anywhere in the building.
50,Great location staff and casino. Eataly is a great option for many choices. New bridge over strip makes access safe and smooth. Location to TMobile arena is great for hockey games. Get a casino host for the experienced gamblers. Best way to take advantage of offers.
40,Received email for a promotion about charging to your room $800 to receive a $200 credit on your next stay. So I use my M live rewards credit card to book the room for the mlife rewards point and make all the charges to the room then they proceeded to not let me charge to the room after the card Exceeded its limit of $850. I had cash and other credit cards that I could have paid the difference with given the chance. I proceeded to pay for the remaining purchases with my other cash and credit cards.. Went to the M life rewards desk and the VIP desk to get help to show the credit and neither one could do it saying that because it wasn't charged the room I wasn't eligible. If this is how your rewards program is going to work I may have to stop staying at the MGM and try other options. I stay at MGM resorts 3 to 4 times if not more every year I am very unhappy with this!
20,Noise in the room. Couldn't have a good sleep.  Nothing in the room anymore. I guess this is the new norm to provide very minimum.  The resort fee is not justified. Expensive and no value. Internet connection not secured!!!!!!!!
50,We love the smoke free hotel and gaming area. The Primrose has a wonderful breakfast selection. I usually get the fruit plate which is ver filling. The staff there were very nice. We also love the Eatlery(?) and always make reservation at LaLaNoodle. The digital check in was very good. We did not have much contact with any hotel employees.
40,My room wasn’t serviced one day. When I called to get towels at 8:45 in the evening I was told they’d be up right away. I called 20 minutes later and was told they’re busy they’ll get to me. I went to the front desk to ask to talk to a manager and was told it would be a 10 minute wait. I went to another person Karla. She was awesome and contacted the manager. Jared came down and said I’d have towels within 15 minutes. 15 minutes passed no towels however Jared called to check in with me and was surprised no towels had arrived and said they’ll be up right away. 5 minutes later the towels arrived even if it was 1 hour and 45 minutes after I first called. 2 hours later housekeeping showed up. Thank you to Karla who actually took the time to show concern and to Jared as well for following up. Other than that this is one of my favorite hotels on the strip. Great location and smoke free!
50,I was very impressed with Park MGM It was clean non-smoking and the staff was incredibly helpful. The online check in process is seamless and was great because there are no lines to wait in. There are a lot of options for food bars and more in Little Eatly in the front of the hotel.
50,Amazing place to stay with family or fun. Has everything you could need. Including a well appointed weight room for a quick vacation workout as well as smoke free casino and food options. I won't stay anywhere else in Vegas.
30,Great location but so crowded and takes an hour to get starbucks any time before noon. Beds were soft and lumpy - almost considered going elsewhere. Easy check in and quick room service but limited menu - not recommended if have kids.
50,I found this to be an excellent place to stay for non-smokers. The entire casino is non-smoking my room was fantastic. Clean friendly close to other casinos and generally a very good choice. I will definitely come back here.
50,First time at Park MGM Las Vegas very happy to know that it is smoke free. Very conveniently located close to T-Mobile Arena close to the airport. The catering staff was very kind courteous very prompt they made the break time during conference very enjoyable.
40,Stayed for 4 nights. Check in was easy very friendly staff room was ready early.  The room is a little different. Has a combined bathroom/closet door which is kind of odd a long skinny sofa table and a chair. The room was very clean. Very quiet. King bed was very comfortable. Large shower with great water pressure. You must tell them at check in that you want housekeeping. They have shampoo/conditioner/lotion/hairdryer/iron and a safe. There is a free tram to Aria and Bellagio unfortunately it wasn't working while we were there. Lots of food options on site and next door at NYNY. CVS drugstore on the other side. Only real negative is horrible wifi.
50,Excellent place to stay in Vegas. Close to strip and great restaurants like Eatally. The rooms are clean and nice set up. Played the slots and very good selections especially Quick Links Dragon Money bags and Dancing Drums.
50,We had a great experience. The beds were comfortable the water pressure was amazing and the customer service was great! The floors with rooms was very quiet and the front desk and VIP area was very accommodating.
30,The location of the property is great. It is Not a far walk from the bellagio. The rooms are below average. There was a burn hole and tears in the carpet the furniture was dated and looked worn out. The bathroom needed a good cleaning. There was no mini fridge or microwave in the room which was very annoying. The hotel lobby was average however the food options and coffee were good.
50,Great views and nice rooms. Easy access to the strip. Nice amenities and very friendly staff and tram service runs from the hotel to the other end of the strip so getting around the strip with small kids is much easier.
50,The stay was amazing! I’m a local and got a room because I was there celebrating my 30 birthday seeing Bruno Mars that night! I just want to shout out Preston From the box office! He was very pleasant to talk to and was super nice and if he wasn’t sure about something he found out the answer for me! I would be back again just based on the friendly interaction! Thank you again for being a part of my magical night!
50,no smoking. clean room friendly staff. breakfast is a little crowded and reservations are a must. the foyer has not many places to sit down while waiting for tables. the crowd for check-in can be very busy. to get to the strip you need to go thru the casino and that creates a lot of traffic while playing there also for me it was to many children passing through. plus it creates a lot of commotion. otherwise the casino is very roomy
10,For a hotel of this caliber I expected to have rooms with more privacy. We could hear everything that occurred in the room next door - from coughing talking to many other things throughout the night. Twice throughout our stay we returned to our room and my children even noticed the smell of marijuana. Expected more from an MGM property.
50,Fun and relaxing. Good food. Fun playing the slots. Relaxing pool side. Good exercise walking from casino to casino. Very friendly employees very helpful and courteous. Very good prices and I would recommend your hotel casino to my friends.
50,The Park MGM was the Monte Carlo which was a good property. The Park MGM is an amazing property! Smoke free everything casino hotel rooms restaurants pool! Super friendly staff some of the best in Vegas! This hotel is in the right place just across the street from the T-Mobile Arena which has concerts and is home to the NHL Golden Knights . Inside the Park you will find Eataly a little slice of Italy from gelato to fresh pasta and wine. Dine at Best Friends a Korean/Mexican restaurant or Bavette's steak house and a late night Side Betty or Primrose are on the property. Want more class acts head to Dolby Live to check out Silk Sonic or Lady Gaga or Aerosmith! Catch the tram from inside the Park to see the shops at Aria or the Bellagio for more entertainment and shopping. This is going to be your best bet for having a great time in Vegas.
50,This was a great hotel!! super clean super friendly staff slept great. Super accommodating for pets! Good price. Just not in the middle of the strip but didn’t mind at all!!! Good parking ramp for our car to sit in overnight.
50,Love this the hotel for the rates and the cleanliness. The no smoking is a perk and it is so nice to walk right to the concert in the Dolby from your room you can actually wear heels!! Great job Park MGM!!!!
50,The casino and entire hotel is smoke free. This is a lovely change from all the other casinos on the strip. The rooms are nice and have been updated nicely. We really enjoyed our stay here and would highly recommend it.
50,Lovely hotel and entire hotel including the casino are smoke free! This means nice clean slot machines and no one smoking right beside you. The rooms are very nice and beds are comfortable. I’d recommend this hotel.
40,Great location! Within walking distance of a lot of attractions. TRAM service is also attached to the hotel. Very friendly and knowledgable staff who was willing to go above and beyond to assist with guest needs.
10,I have been coming to Vegas for 40 years and I have always looked forward to good service and nice rooms. I have stayed at the Nomad before and have been very satisfied. I will NEVER go back to the Park MGM. The rooms were barren. I paid close to $50 for a resort fee and I couldn't even get a bottle of water. Not even a pen and pad in the room. When I asked the front desk manager he told me the resort fee gave me internet and unlimited access to the casino. That is ridiculous. He was rude and condescending. There are many other choices on the strip to choose from.
40,Nice place to stay.  Parking is very convenient.  Room is pretty clean and the best part is the shower. The water stream is strong.  Overall is a decent stay I would say. However there is no fridge and the floor height is approx. 220 cm.  Therefore if you are tall you would probably feel uncomfortable.
50,I love my stay in Vegas this was my first time there and definitely won’t be my last I loved everything about it actually planning another trip very very soon thank you for everything y’all definitely will see us again
50,Our flight was canceled and our friends and I decided to try Park MGM for the night. It was great - rooms were nice and we did not have to wait even though we were a bit before check in time. Eataly was outstanding and made the extra unplanned night an enjoyable time.
50,Wonderful time. No complaints. Loved the Italian food court. Also having the tram (that was free) was helpful to get to other casinos. The Bellagio was beautifully decorated. Had a lot of fun and cant wait to go back again.
50,I Really enjoy the stay there everything was excellent room was clean  everyone was friendly staff was excellent. We would stay there again when we visit Vegas again We we’re on the main strip walking distance to everywhere we went easy check in and check out. The eatery was good and no smoking was excellent
20,"We could hear our neighbors talking as if they were in our room. Someone knocked and then came in our room ""to check the snack bar."" I met her at the door as she was opening it. Bed and pillow was soft."
50,Our check in was great! Whatever assistance we needed was received! The staff was friendly and very courteous ! The room was beautiful and our view was gorgeous! We enjoyed being close to the elevator!
50,Everyone was wonderful. Some of the nicest people you’ll ever meet. Can’t wait to come back. We were there during March madness and also Saint Patrick’s day there was allot of fun events going on and allot of fun things to participate in.
30,I was very disappointed in the room. It was dirty noisy smelled like cigarettes and marijuana. I was there for three nights and didn't sleep well any of the nights. For an MGM hotel on the strip the room was a huge disappointment. If in my control I will not stay here again.
50,Park MGM had everything right there. Didn’t have to leave and the best part was it was SMOKE FREE!!! We will definitely be going back to stay there. Bavettes steakhouse was fantastic. Service and food was a 10!
50,Hotel rooms were alright expect no fridge for take out leftovers kid friendly foods and bed were amazing. Staff were nice and helpful on our stay! Pool hours sucked and need kid area with more fun activity.
50,Lovely room-decor- good beds- nice view . The hotel is in a great location- liked the fact that it was smaller and smoke free. The Eately offers delicious food and lots of selection. Parking was easily accessible. Pool area is very nice too.
50,Love the Park! It's become our most frequent stay in Vegas. Enjoyed the spa the sportsbook Bavette's Eataly slots and tables this trip. We bounced to Bellagio Caesar's Planet Hollywood and more but Smoke-Free is the only way to go!!
50,Loved it!!! Beautifully decorated interior spacious rooms and overall an above average extremely clean hotel. Great location on the strip. Wonderful food nice staff. I will definitely be staying here again in the near future.
50,Excellent time we had beds were very comfy staff really friendly loved the eatery at the front of the casino best gelato best pizza. This location was really easy to access the parking from our room. We will definitely stay here again.
50,The hotel was great. I can't wait for my next trip to Vegas. Love the slots. The food at la la noodle was fantastic. The was great the bed was very soft. Went to see silk sonic great concert my wife loved it.
50,I enjoyed the room. It had a very large shower. Magnified mirror nice warm water .  The bed was comfortable. Tv was adjustable could be adjusted to view while sitting in chair at table or lying in bed. I had a good view of the New York New York Hotel and T Mobile stadium and mountains .  I liked the walk thru smokefree casino. The Dolby Live was connected so I didn't have to go outside for the Bruno MarsAnderson.Paak Silk Sonic concert it was awesome with a lot of effects. The customer service bell assistance security guard etc everyone was kind and helpful. I liked the elevator where you had to scan your room card and choose floor in order to get to your select floor. Traveling alone I had a great time. No worries. Prices for water soda and chips were really expensive in the hotel. I found a ABC store across the over street walk way with much reasonable prices and souvenirs. Even a Denny's for a normal breakfast.
50,Nice hotel and casino. Staffuture great and the whole place is non smore gking. Pools were great with lots of lounge chairs. Great restaurants and bars. Everyone was very friendly. Will diffenitly be back in the near future.
50,Clean and well organized. Amazing ambiance and superb restaurants. Early check in was one of the easiest in Vegas. Staff was all very accommodating. Housekeeping was attentive. Easy parking access for hotel. Location is perfect
50,Awesome place to stay. I really recommend this hotel. Love the cleanliness! I really like how u can breathe and no smoking at all... so u can be playing without choking.... please check this hotel and u will agreed with me.....
50,We're back in Vegas and back at the Park. As we recover from Covid and reopen the Park is poised to be #1 on the Strip. This smoke free hotel has stepped up it's slots tables are clean and professional but the restaurants are the main bragging point. The rooms are bougy (did I spell that right) - on the small side with simple but very clean and nice luxuries. You never wait long for an elevator even when the hotel is sold out. Have you been to Eatily? Oh yea and the MGM properties HONOR and RESPECT veterans - not all Vegas hotels do.
50,Visited Vegas with friends to watch the first 3 rounds of the NCAA tournament. Second time staying at the Park MGM. Really liked the hotel and casino especially the no smoking policy. Was great not having clothes smell like a ash tray. The updated rooms were very nice clean and well appointed. The sportsbook and bar/ were excellent place to view the games with great service. The food was excellent. Also the sportsbook was well staffed. Would definitely stay at the Park MGM again.
50,OMG it was Fantastic!! We were celebrating my grandson's 21st birthday and it turned out so well. I am truly appreciative of everyone there and the fact that we were able to all stay on one floor everyone near each other made it so much easier and we all felt like we were home!!
40,Love the fact the hotel and casino are non-smoking! Everyone was professional and courteous from the valet to the bell service and VIP check-in.    The only downside is no food is available in the hotel late besides room service. Nit even snacks. After a long night of gambling I get hungry and had to walk to find food at another casino.    The rooms are nice and comfy
50,It was our first time staying here and it was phenomenal!!!!! Guest services were super friendly and helpful and the whole hotel was super clean! Can't wait to stay again!! We were worried we wouldn't be able to check in because we arrived early and we had no issue what so ever and got up to our room with no hassle at all!!
50,Everything was perfect checked in and out through the app mobile app with key was great. Best part is the it’s smoke free and the Restaurants are the best. We wntcto Bauvette’s and Eataly both were amazing.
40,Had a conference at Aria which was sold out so stayed here due to proximity to Aria and short walk in between two hotels. Room was decent. I had a stay well room but best part is no smoking. I wasn’t expecting much but was pleasantly surprised and would stay here again. Central location.
30,The hotel is in a good location right on the strip. One can walk everywhere from here. Staff was nice and helpful. The only thing that was less positive was the fact that the rooms need a small facelift. Apart from that all was good!
50,Great staff non smoking rooms are nice. Parking was easy! Weekend price was quite pricey though.    Staff was awesome. They accommodated me for another night when they were already sold out!    Drinks are pricey.
50,The park mgm looks like a new property is a non smoking resort and what a difference!! The staff is friendly and helpful the bed super comfortable the only think I didn’t like the room didn’t have mini fridge neither coffee maker
40,The room was clean and the location was perfect. The holding fee per night was pretty high and I was a little disappointed there was no microwave or refrigerator in my room. But overall the hotel itself was nice and had plenty of activities.
50,In a smoke-filled Vegas this smoke-free serene hotel is just the place to return at the end of a fun Vegas day! Love the free tram to Bellagio too. Eately is out front for a quick bite or drink. Comfy beds super clean rooms.
50,A one stop vacation experience! In the middle of all the action and full of entertainment options. Hotel and pool are awesome. We came for the Silk Sonic show and the after party was steps away. We ate at one of the several restaurants there. We can't to go back! PARK MGM ROCKS
50,Loved the fact that we could gamble still breath and not get a sore throat from smoke. Hotel is in a great location and very nice. Eataly Italian food court is really nice eating area to grab a bite to eat or a drink and hang out in. Highly recommend.
20,The staff here is very friendly but Park MGM offers the most basic of accommodations with little-to-no impressive features for the price. Clean enough but everything is very dingey and tired. Though it was nice to stay at a nonsmoking facility the perfumes used here are nauseating. All common and private areas show their age. Take a walk down the strip and find better food gaming and rooms at any other hotel.
20,Room was hot. It's not even summer and room was really really hot. WIFI was terrible but they want you to use digital key which is difficult if you can't connect to anything. Just an average room. Not a great experience. there are many other better options
40,Great hotel and location for the price. Better than I expected for a first time stay. Resort could use more restaurants that are open late. Overall clean rooms and nice employees. Pool was nice but service was slow. Maybe time of year. Visited in April. Adding a mini fridge to the rooms would have been nice for keeping beverages cold etc.
40,We had a great time at Park MGM. This is our 2nd stay at this property. Easy check in and valet parking. Non-smoking casino is probably my favorite about this property. Thanks to the dealers pit boss and host that make it wonderful.  Only one of the three pools was open but I assume it was because it was still early in the season. We had a nice afternoon in the pool on the one warm day. Beer was cold and the sun felt great.  The rooms are a little dated and there was not a fridge in our room but it was clean and cozy. The showers are large but they need to update shower heads so they don't spray all over the place.  On the Record was a blast and we had so much fun at the Silk Sonic after party. My wife and I danced the night away.  Bavette's we had great service and good food.  We would stay again and love the location on the strip.
50,Loved this smoke-free hotel and casino conveniently located on the strip near many other hotels and shops. We didn’t have a car so we walked all over and it was great for our stay. Plus we were watching a show at the Dolby Live so it was a 5-7 walk from our hotel room. Would highly recommend staying here again.
50,Very nice hotel. My second time staying here. Non smoking is a plus! The hotel actually smells good. The staff are great check in was quick and easy and the Dolby Theater is on property for easy concert access.
50,I like staying here - it's clean and quiet. Stay here if you want to stay away from the vegas crowd and still want to have a good time. Conveniently take the tram if you want to go to the other casinos/parts of vegas.
30,The bathroom set up was not the best as the flat sink was probably a poor choice as well as the bath tub which is not preferred and I cringe to use it every time. The sinks do not drain properly and collected every residue and germ from each usage. The toiletries were very limited and extremely dry on the skin so we had to pick up some of own at Walgreens. The bed and pillows weren’t comfortable. I woke up with a very sore neck everyday as the pillows were very puffy and strenuous for upper back and head. The walls are very thin as we heard the neighbour having sex in the AM lol. We felt our friends’ room were better as they had a standup shower and supposedly better beds.    However the location is situated in the busiest strip of the scene so walking and taking the tram to other hotels were great. This hotel had the best scent and air quality out of all the other hotels. Other hotels smells of pure cigarettes and it was extremely difficult to breathe. If I had to stay here again I’ll try booking a different room but I’d really like to try out the new Resort World as the scenery was a more younger vibe with an amazing Street Food eateries and an abundant of restaurants I wanted to try.
40,I stayed at Park MGM in March 2022. Really enjoyed it. Nice location to go places. Free tram to Aria Bellagio. Right next to Shake Shack. I like their hamburger and fries. Close to stores for beverage snack and some other grocery items.
40,"The rooms were comfortable and the location is central to the strip. The hotel is a no-smoking hotel which was a plus. Having a tram that takes you to the Bellagio was appreciated by my tired feet. Overall a nice hotel but without any ""wow"" features."
40,My wife and I stayed here for the weekend as we were seeing Silk Sonic at Dolby Live theater and had a great stay. Location is great casino isn't gigantic so it is very easy to get around the property yet still great amount of table and slot games. Ride share was very easy to get too pool is nothing super special but great if your looking to soak up the sun and relax. Only complaint was that the elevators took a very long time and would sometimes have a line but overall a great place to stay.
20,Very basic hotel rooms are subpar hallways on room floors are dark and unpleasant to the eye mini bar is below the bare minimum carpet is filthy decor is bad taste the casino area is decent restaurant options are decent
50,The hotel was lovely. I especially enjoyed that it was smoke free. Had we been able to get another room we would have stayed the entire time. The check out process was a nightmare. None of the kiosks were functioning. The check out line was extremely long and I was unable to stand in line without pain. We dropped the keys in the drop box but was charged the extra days anyway.
50,The Park MGM isi in a Great location  quiet dark rooms with very comfortable beds and great showers. Easy to get around the strip via tram and Lyft. Primrose and Bavettes are great food options and casino dealers /pit are friendly and quirky
50,Love the no smoking atmosphere; you can breathe easily. From check in to check out; the staff exceeded my expectations. 3 Pools are well maintained and conveniently situated. Amenities are exceptional.
40,Rooms are nice but no coffee maker frig or microwave in room. First day stood in line for 45 minutes at Starbucks 2nd day went without coffee and 3 day waited until after 11:00am to get coffee and only had to wait 25 minutes.
40,The hotel was very clean and nice. Great location. Staff at front desk were rude during check-in and very short during check out. The staff at the restaurant (Pimrose) were very welcoming and kind. Would stay again
50,The stay was great nice staff clean facilities great spa. My only concern is during this stay the beds were a bit hard. Not sure if something changed between February to April but that was different.
30,Great location pretty clean nice staff. Needs more coffee/breakfast options. Standing in line for an hour for a cup of coffee is ridiculous. Also hotel wouldn't remove the mini bar from our room unless we paid $50. We had a dog traveling with us that would've really enjoyed eating all of that chocolate--not cool. Overall nice hotel in a great location. Also LOVE that it is non-smoking!
40,"I recently went on a trip to the Park MGM with 2 other girlfriends as part of a bachelorette. We stayed at the Park MGM as it was by far the best price given location. We shared a queen room which came with a view of the strip and we were very happy with the room. Beds were very comfortable - the pillows particularly so (pillows are so important to me when sleeping!) and the room was clean and a nice size.    The Park MGM is a great location with a tram linking you to the large hotels further up the strip This avoids long walks or requiring taxis.    The Park MGM itself is relatively small which means you dont have mile of walking and not a tourist attraction which means the hotel is quieter that others on the strip and feels more like somewhere you can return ""home"" to to relax and enjoy some down time.    The main reason this is 4* and not 5* is the pool area. The pools themselves are lovely and great sun traps but busy. We were there during the week and the hotel wasn't particularly busy and we still struggled to get sun loungers. This is a HUGE bug bear of mine when on holiday. If I'm staying in a hotel I expect to be able to enjoy that hotels pool without any stress of difficulty.    The other reason is security. Whilst the lift themselves would not permit you access to a floor without an appropriate key card it would not be difficult for someone to follow you in. They would benefit from having at leat one security guard at the lift entrances."
30,The table and the side tables next to the bed were dirty. They had something sticky left over from the previous guests. Lots of dust on the tables and around tv. I expected the room to be cleaned well especially due to Covid. But the tables were not wiped in what seems to be a very long time. I never experienced anything like this in any of the other hotels on the Vegas strip. Beds were comfortable and the location was great.
40,Clean and good customer service  Check in was easy and great rooms also clean . Didn't get to play in the casino but next time I think I will check out was also pretty easy a little hectic but thats expected in vegas
10,I loved the non-smoking idea but there were people smoking. Room was very old and almost like it was in a basement. Used auto check in and room key which is really nice but then I wonder if u do that u get the lower floor old rooms? Got a digital key on my phone at 5pm and got to room at 1130 pm there was an attendant in the room when we arrived that said the room was just prepared so what would have happened if we arrived when we got the digital key???? . Steakhouse wasn't good. Room was very small and sad and not very clean. Will not stay again.
50,We had an excellent stay. Staff are friendly and room is very clean. I love the no smoking casino. Las Vegas blvd is very accessible and there are a number of places to eat. Lala Noodle is highly recommended.
10,The front desk cant seem to get the room cards to activate and are quite rude. It took three tries to get it to work and the desk clerk was condescending in the process by saying we need to keep it away from credit cards etc. this is topped off by mediocre italian themes and restaurants that do not keep their posted hours. This hotel is nothing special with small rooms and poor service. Not worth the rates they charge.
30,Overall stay is fine. fraudulent beverage charges from pool bar show up at check out for the stay. Got charges removed at the checkout desk only to find it appear on the credit bill a few days later. Had to call hotel and push back bar manager to resolve charges. Ok to stay but watch your room charges and be prepared to spend extra time to dispute.
30,Rooms are decent great value. No one beats the property shower pressure and hot water. Done issues with air conditioning in room but not too bad. Security needs to better monitor halls for Marijuana smoke from some time which unless you enjoy the smell could be bothersome
50,We booked at Park MGM for location to the TMobile arena but we were pleasantly surprised with the hotel. This hotel and casino are all non-smoking and we truly appreciated that. My husband and I have been to Vega many times but this was the first trip that we took our kids. (14 and 11) They enjoyed Vegas so much. Park MGM is home to Eataly... an amazing Italian inspired restaurant/ market with delicious food and wine. The casino floor is always clean and busy. The rooms are comfortable and the pillows were just right. There are 3 pools. One is 18 and up the other 2 are family friendly. All offer full service with bar and poolside servers. I would highly recommend Park MGM. We will be back.
50,This wasn’t the first time for me staying at Park MGM. Every time I enjoyed my mini vacation. This trip was my birthday getaway and I enjoyed the every minute of my trip. The only thing I can ask for is to put the mini fridge for guests to keep their drinks cold. Thank you.
10,When we got to the hotel around 10:00pm to checkin which was easy we got to the room the bathroom was disgusting. Some one had gone “to the bathroom” thank god the toilet was flushed but the toilet bowl was…. Horrible.. it was incredibly gross.. and the sink was not clean. We aren’t incredibly difficult people so we just asked for someone to come up and clean for us while we went out to explore the strip a little. We came back almost 2 hours later and came back to the bathroom still not cleaned. It took them another 20 min to come up and clean the bathroom. The next day was ok turn down service without a problem. The next 2 days no one came. We stopped some one in the hall the third day they cleaned but then Didn’t replace any of the towels. So as we went out for the evening we stopped at the desk to request some towels. Not that we spent a lot of time watching tv but the tv wasn’t working well it took for ever for a channel to come up and it seemed like the remote wasn’t working. The walls are incredibly thin as we are heard most of the conversations Of our neighbors. We were also all the way at the end of the hall which felt like we were walking down the hall in “The Shinning”. Not really the problem I guess we were next to service elevators or a service room of some sort so we often heard wheels rolling on something I’m not sure if it was above us or next to us. The bed was also very uncomfortable. I’ve stayed in a much less expensive Hilton with a much more comfortable stay. I was honestly just really surprised I expected so much more from an mgm hotel. My wife and I were celebrating our 18th anniversary and it is our first “big trip”. I felt bad because my wife was more frustrated with the different things which made the “Stay” part of our trip very uncomfortable.
50,This hotel is an awesome place to stay. Especially if you have kids and don't want them to smell smoke. The rooms are very nice and clean. There was hand sanitizer everywhere. I will definitely be coming back here.
20,This is an older hotel that is in dire need of upgrading. This room was sparsely furnished. There was no refrigerator microwave dresser pensor riding tablets in the room. There was rust on the fire sprinkler in the bathroom. The carpet showed years of wear indicated by the dirt stains in the carpet.
50,Early check in and late check out was a huge perk and worth the money. Complimentary bag drop service. Rooms were clean and spacious. Water pressure was amazing. The amenities were unreal. If you’re watching a show at the Dolby BOOK here. OTR is a must!
50,This casino is fun and non-smoking. Eataly is wonderful and too many choices but the food is delicious. Room was pleasant and comfortable several pools. Multiple restaurants to choose from at varying prices. Great location and can walk to NY NY as well as mall over walkway bridge. Access to tram to other MGM locations. Has Dolby theatre as well as next to T-Mobile. I have been going to LV for years and this was one of the best places I have stayed in.
40,We enjoyed The Park the location was good we used the pool and hot tub. The staff were excellent and accommodating anything we asked for was provided. We are breakfast people and found the restaurants in the park were a little over priced for what you received.
50,While the rooms are basic in nature as there aren't any frills or extras. The one thing you can count on is that the rooms are extremely clean. The bathrooms are nice while the showers are large and did I mention clean?! Housekeeping is spot on :)    Our rooms exceeded my expectations.
50,We loved our stay at Park MGM. The staff was friendly the housekeepers were helpful and kind. The casino layout is very easy to maneuver and being able to eat at the amazing restaurants (like La Noodle) or Eatily make it an awesome place to stay. Highly recommend!
50,Nice location on strip smoke free good choices for food and entertainment. Pool area was nice quick drink and food options. Drink service on casino floor caters to table games not so generous for slot players.
50,Outstanding. Love the layout. Great VIP services. Love the fact the hotel is Non-smoking. Fun restaurants especially Eataly. Great environment. Lots of food choices. Easy to navigate around the hotel.
50,The Park is in a excellent location on the strip. I had a two queen pool view room which was a good size and very clean. The bed was very comfortable. The shower was wonderful with good water pressure. The food choices within the hotel are adequate but there is no real late night dining however with New York New York MGM and Aria just a few steps away there are plenty of dining choices.
50,I couldn’t of asked for a more painless time! The check-in/out process was amazing! The hotel is extremely clean. One thing as it was my first time at this hotel it was a little confusing to find my way around.
50,I had a great time at park mgm. They allowed my dogs come along and didn’t have any issues with my dogs. Checking in was smooth and ordering room service was easy and quick. Just wish they had coke products:
50,Great place to stay. Nice rooms not too large but well done a nice upgrade to the Monte Carlo which we had stated in the past. Staff are very friendly and make you feel important! Highly recommend also great location on the strip.
40,The day we got there we discovered blood and stains on our sheets. We called down and they said they were sending someone up. An hour went by so we called again. 30 minutes later when no one showed up we called again. No one came but we got a call at 1:30AM asking if we needed our sheets changed. We told them they could come tomorrow since we were already asleep. The following morning I went down to the desk to confirm they were going to change the sheets while we were out for the day. The lady said she put a note in the computer and that they would be changed. We returned 12 hours later and the sheets WERE STILL NOT CHANGED. We immediately went down and asked to speak to a manager. The manager told us that he was going to send the housekeeping manager to our room immediately. 30 minutes later a housekeeping lady showed up and changed our sheets.
50,Great non smoking casino. The waitresses were great and the Vip was great to check in early. The slots payed out different variety of games. Big name singers playing there at the MGM park. Great variety of foods to eat.
50,Staff was very helpful especially when checking in and made it very easy. Rooms are very spacious and clean. I love that there is a starbucks inside the hotel and well as amazing restaurantes My favorite one of course is Best Friends.
30,A birthday trip for my wife and if was her first time in Vegas. I like that fact that Parks MGM is smoke free 🙌 we both are not smokers. We like the staff and we celebrate her birthday at the steakhouse which was 5 star. Excellent services!!!
50,The rooms were phenomenal with the most gorgeous bathrooms. Overall a very classy spot that I would definitely visit again. It smelled so fresh and clean throughout the property. I really enjoyed all the dining options as well.
40,Great stay convenient for the Silk Sonic concert. But when I got home and notice that I left some items in the closet that’s where the disappointment went done. Couldn’t find my items. Resort fee ref
10,This just isn't my cup of tea. It's cramped long elevator lines people aren't friendly way too many slots not enough space for blackjack and craps. Sports book hours were too limited and way too much emphasis placed on betting on machines instead of with people. Only thing good about this place is Best Friend and that drink tickets didn't expire.
50,Hotel was excellent and casino was great. Smoke free hotel was perfect. Casino and hotel smells great. Downfall is No refrigerator in room to keep cold drinks or microwave in case you have left overs.
50,Stayed here for a convention at Mandalay Bay which was sold out. This was the next closest option. Great newly refurbished hotel (formerly Monte Carlo) small-medium size made it easy to get in/out of room to taxi without having to deal w casino. But the food offerings and Starbucks off lobby and were also convenient and a short walk through small-ish casino gets you to Eataly also a great food option. Good size pool so even with kids there you could find a chaise to relax with more quiet. Rooms spacious and functional nice updated bathrooms. Only complaints were leaky shower door that got the floors wet and you could hear neighbor next door as they were opening and closing the ball-bearing blinds. However it was a solo traveler next door so never heard talking or tv. All in all a great stay and great value (know it depends on the demand but was surprised price was so reasonable considering the convention nearby!) This is also a great location if attending NHL game or concert at T Mobile arena which is steps away. The Park area just outside the hotel and arena is a great touch and is slightly off The Strip. Still easy to walk to MGM Grand for dining as well.
50,This was my 2nd time staying at the Park MGM when attending a concert at T Mobile Arena it is right across the street so you can walk to/from the concert venue.    The entire Park MGM property is also NON-SMOKING which is great for non-smokers like me! There is a separate adult pool also which is very nice to relax and have a few drinks in or by the pool without getting splashed by kids!
40,Had a good time here. Pool was fun. Everything was going good until I got to much sun and got sick in my room. When trying to deal with it was told no house keeping and waited a very long time for the new sheets for my room. Other then that a decent stay
40,Stayed at Park for the first time. We really enjoyed the smoke free casino and hotel even outside by the pool. It is in a great location on the strip. Overall had a great time!  We will definitely stay here again in the future
50,I loved the Great slots clean gaming area beautiful suite and completely non smoking environment. The location is great and within short walking distance to other MGM resorts so that you can enjoy all the rewards program comps that you have earned
40,MGM Resorts offered tournaments by invitation throughout the year.  The offers are usually with room reservations and libation. Park MGM is a new discovery. First time at the complex a bit go getting use to. Its like preparing food with some one kitchen. Facility is no smoking by design and yet have all a the usual Casino checklist choices in one place. Music table games lobby bars with TV screen for sports watching and restaurants. One stand outs is that of the Italian corner called Eataly. Here you have strictly all Italian flavored restaurants and delicacies. I was able to eat and bring home candies and cookies. It reminded me of being in Lucca. What a welcome surprise.
50,Smoke free facilities Primrose restaurant a jewel especially Nicole P. great service and 3 pools! Super variety of restaurants slot machines table games and entertainment. Conveniently located on the Las Vegas strip and close to the airport.
50,Excellent customer service all around. Park MGM is a great location not to far from the airport at is amid other hotels and retails for additional shopping and dining experiences. Pleased with the room upgrades and cleanliness much improved from previous stay.
40,At first the very streamlined decor of the rooms seemed too sterile for my liking but after just one day I found that it more than met my needs. The beds were some of the most comfortable that I've ever stayed in. The view from our room of the Las Vegas strip area was fabulous...especially at night. The fact that this is a NON-SMOKING facility was also very nice.
40,We just returned from a few days at park MGM w our kids ages 1110&8. A really good spot for kids. Hotel in a perfect location on the strip and Eataly and being smoke free lend itself to being kid friendly as does the pool area. Not rowdy not party pools they play nice tasteful music and it’s great for kids. The rooms and bathrooms are small and they could have done a better job decorating and lighting the hallway. Overall a nice place
40,King room was a bit small. Bathroom was great-fabulous shower. Could hear all noise from hallway next door neighbors and outside-could use better soundproofing. Best Friend restaurant was the highlight of our trip--be sure to make a reservation as it gets packed like most other Vegas restaurants. We would stay here again and just remember to bring along ear plugs.
10,Vegas shows and dining was great but not the hotel especially the shower dripping the whole time so hard to sleep. First time staying at this hotel want to the rewards counter the lady was not friendly at all. She might consider changing her job. Next time Delano or Bellagio only
50,We love the location rooms the size of the casino restaurants and the rewards you receive for playing at the Park or any MGM property. They make it easy to get to other MGM hotels in the area and you can use the same players card at all MGM properties.
30,The location amenities and style of the hotel are all first rate. Room design was minimal but had all the amenities…but it was very very noisy…from rooms next door and above…I won’t stay here again but if you are a heavy sleeper it is a good option
40,Overall nice. Stayed at MGM Grand befor and i would prefer Park MGM over the Grand. Neither had a fridge. Room was either too hot or too cold. MORE IMPORTANTLY SILK SONIC HAS THE RESIDENCY. A MUST SEE.
50,Everything literally from the helpful staff members the restaurants the dolby live concert area was amazing it was a short trip for the Silk Sonic concert but everything was amazing!! The view the pools the food ugh I'm ready to go back and I will definitely stay here again! Such a great location. I wish it was a 24hour restaurant but literally across the street it's fat burger and Walgreens which is 24 hours and a pizza place that closes late as well so we didn't go hungry and it was convenient that it was so close love love love this hotel can't wait to come back!!!!
50,We just returned from four nights at the Park MGM Las Vegas and overall we had an excellent stay. This resort was formally the Monte Carlo but has been completely revamped inside and out such that it was hard to recognize any MC features. We originally booked a king room but upon check-in upgraded to a Skylark Suite. The Skylark Suite features 900 Sq. feet among two rooms a lounge room with pullout sofa dining table large TV Nescafe espresso maker and a personal fridge. The bedroom featured a king bed with dresser mirrors TV and large closet. The bathroom featured a very large shower and a separate doored toilet. Our view was of the T-Mobile arena and the mountains and it was very nice. Overall many positives about the room. The entire hotel is smoke free which is fabulous! The pool area has three separate pools including one for people 21+. The hotel has the Bose Theatre attached and also features a complimentary tram to Aria and then on to Bellagio. From a food standpoint it's connected to Eataly which is a collection of Italian themed food and dessert kiosks serving everything from fresh sandwiches to grilled chicken to steaks. It's all walkup service and the food is excellent. If you're trying to stay on the strip accessible to all of the huge casinos and resorts yet wanting to avoid the mega crowds The Park is an excellent choice in our minds. Costs to stay at The Park MGM were also quite reasonable when compared to other upscale MGM properties.
50,I was very happy with the hotel. I like that it’s non smoking. It’s a good location. We went for the Silk Sonic concert. Loved that we didn’t have to leave the hotel. I enjoyed the pool area. Very active but not rowdy.
40,Quick family getaway from SoCal. Park MGM is set perfectly on the strip near lots of other places. Will definitely stay here again. Online check-in and e-key make this experience much much smoother. Thank you!
50,I hope the MGM group will keep do smoke free forever even in the casino. Every where I walked through very clean. I can feel and got fresh smell like in the flower garden. Close to Dolby liveClose to Arena and have Tram connect all MGM groups.
40,Park MGM is in a great location and has clean rooms. I love that the casino is non-smoking. I have stayed here when it was the Monte Carlo the Park MGM is a nice upgrade to it. I plan on coming back in the future.
50,I love the fact that the whole hotel and casino is NON-SMOKING.  This is definitely the cleanest dog-friendly hotel on the strip.  Good customer service as well.  Plus I won on their slot machines multiple times!!!
50,My wife and I take a trip somewhere every year for our anniversary. This year we decided to spend p couple of our vacation days in Las Vegas at the Park MGM. We we have stayed at quite a range different hotels in Vegas this time we were offered a comp room so we thought we'd give it a try. I could go into details but in short we enjoyed our stay.
30,Rooms clean and convenient to amenities. Thin walls mean you can hear everything. Sex sounds screaming children down the whole hallway. Hallway lighting is a date rape waiting to happen.    I’m used to other knife properties like Bellagio and Aria.    Still a solid overall value and the staff does a great job.
40,Digital check in experience was awful and the lobby staff didn’t help to satisfaction. However the rooms were neat hotel was very clean and room service was exceptional. Overall a great stay except for the digital check in process.
50,This was my first time to Las Vegas and Solo and I’m very happy I choose Park MGM Great property great atmosphere great location Center strip I couldn’t be happier it was a great first time and solo anyone thinking of going solo great place enjoy I know I will be back
50,We went to celebrate my sister's birthday and everything was great. Our room was always clean when we called for room service they provided our needs in a timely manner. Also whenever we had questions everyone was always willing to help us.
20,Rooms were dirty and there was hair everywhere. Walls between rooms are very thin and you can hear everything and every conversation of your neighbors. Rooms were very expensive for the lack of quality you get.
50,I stayed at the Park MGM with family and the hotel was great in service location and all you would ask from a hotel in Las Vegas. Best part is that it is Smoke Free which is huge for us non-smokers. Great hotel.
20,King room we booked was not available when we arrived. Was told we have to pay an extra $30 a night for a king suite and would remove resort fees. Went to check out and only one night resort fees removed and bed was only a queen. The room was filthy. Was not dusted could see dust on floor blinds broken TV broke. Only had room “cleaned” twice which included changing out towels and giving us more supplies! Very disappointed as I have stayed here before and never have experienced this before. When you travel you expect the king room you booked to be available and if not the hotel should pay the difference and clean the room! We even found a large broken nail on the floor!! Gross
50,This hotel is a hidden gem in the center of the strip absolutely phenomenal in every single way. Spent two days there on a vacation and couldn’t be more impressed with everything we experienced non-smoking hotel beautiful inside and out had a blast at the retro three nightclub fantastic food in Little Italy deathly recommend it!
50,The Park has everything you need. Especially love Eataly! Attended a game at T-Mobile arena which was very convenient. Having a smoke free hotel is an added bonus for me. Always a pleasure to stay here.
40,This has become my new favorite place to stay while in Vegas. I have not been here since it was Monte Carlo and it has changed a lot. For one the location is really good. It is easy access to the airport or freeway if driving you can access the light rail to get from there to Bellagio which is more mid-strip and it is easy pick up for Uber or Lyft once there. Also it is smoke free which is nice. But the main thing I loved is the availability there and nearby for cheaper places to eat. I remember staying at some places where you could not find order at the counter food. Here you can get pizza or fried chicken sandwiches gelato pasta etc and not spend a fortune. The casino is relative small but large enough to fulfill your gambling. You also don't even need to interact with staff because you can check in with the app print your own key card and check out with out talking to anyone.
50,The Park is centrally located on the Strip. It is close to anywhere you want to go and there are excellent food options right in the Casino itself. The Staff was super friendly and made finding different places on the Strip very easy. When it comes to the tables we actually did pretty well on the Craps Tables and the Dealers were very friendly and helpful.
50,I had a wonderful golf trip to Vegas and stayed at the Park MGM knowing that it was smoke free and it was. The food options were wonderful and the location was easy to get in and out of for my 5 days of golf with friends. The mobile check in and out was also easy and actually allowed me to check in early.
40,Recently stayed 3 nights with friends to watch March Madness games. Check in was easy and they accommodated us with adjoining rooms. Resort is smoke free and in a great location within a 10 minute walk of CVS for snacks and liquor. Will be heading back in October for another stay!
30,Park MGM is set at a great location on the strip. Small property and asy to access. Smoke-free is also a huge perk! However the cost for this property during peak times is much too expensive for the room quality and amenities. The rooms have been renovated and are average at best.
50,I booked this hotel as we were going to the Silk Sonic concert. It was very convenient lot of restaurants gambling was decent and service was great. We ate at Best Friend the food was fantastic service and atmosphere awesome!
50,No smoking and cleanliness were much appreciated. The staff was friendly and accommodating. The food was amazing. Champagne and chocolate covered strawberries in the room as requested were nicely chilled. No need to go anywhere else. Will be back.
50,They were awesome and great  They hooked me and the old lady up.great room close to basically everything. I will definitely be coming back for more trips to come and I'm definitely gonna gamble next time!!!!
50,Ill start by saying once you experience this entire non smoking facility you will never want to stay at another hotel ever. Only side note is if you are going with other people have each person reserve their own rooms. We did not do that and only one person reserved the rooms and that came with a few issues. The suites are really large. We could not have been closer to the elevator and wanted to switch rooms but they didnt have another suite available. Turns out we didnt even need to. There was zero noise from the elevator we were so surprised. The pool area and service is fabulous. A super fun environment and great staff. You can reserve chairs or just get there at 9am and grab some but by about 10:30 they are pretty much all taken. The only negative about the location is being right next to the arena. Traffic and waiting on a lift/uber requires a little patience so give yourself enough time. Although everyone raved about Eately we didnt find it very cost effective. They have a sports bar and noodle place but would like to see a regular restaurant with some various food options.
50,First time staying at Park MGM in which I choose Park MGM since it was right next to T-mobile arena for a concert we are attending. Our room had two queen beds with a couch and table which was very spacious. Are bathroom was very spacious as well. Room was very clean as well.
10,Significant errors at check in and check out. At checkout the clerk was openly hostile and her supervisor wasn't much help. The quality of the room was very disappointing. It's pretty bad when you need to bring your own toilet paper...
30,Good location and whole hotel was  Smoke free big plus. However rooms were very basic - No shampoo conditioner or soap was in the room no fridge air was finicky room preference was not honored and hotel elevator was a huge debacle.
50,We had a very nice stay at Park MGM. We were very surprised and appreciated that they were a non smoking hotel. It was awesome to play and not smell smoke or go around smelling like cigarettes. Thank you for that.
40,Central to major venues such as T-Mobile Arena close to Allegiant and Dolby Live. Close to restaurants like Eataly Beer Haus Toms Urban. Connects to Aria New York New York and Vdara. And of course they house the Silk Sonic residence which is a must see concert...BRUNO ROCKS!
50,Second trip to Vegas in a month and tried out Park MGM solely for food experiences and the smoke-free environment. I am hooked. Staff was great it's the perfect location on the strip. Start your day with coffee from Eataly and for sure dine at the Library and Best Friend. No need to leave the property.
30,Poor service at the pool waitress never asked us for a another drink or food. It is a quiet casino but the minimums are too high. Eataly is nice. Location is good for the arena but not if you want to casino hop.
40,I stay here every year when I come from Chicago watch a a hockey game. So it's right across the street which makes it easy to get there as opposed to the other end of of the strip. For you coffee drinkers there is NO coffee maker in the room. Long lines at Starbucks.
50,Nice clean hotel. This place is smoke free which was great for me. The whole place had a nice fragrance. Our room was nice as well but one of our light fixtures was broken. I liked the couch and the green aesthetic throughout the hotel and casino.  I found it difficult to go up and down the elevators as they require a key card to use.  I came here for the silk sonic residency and it was so convenient since the Dolby live theater is connected. It’s also right across the street from T Mobile arena. They have an Eataly food court among other restaurants. There’s a Starbucks inside. It has access to a tram that goes to Aria Crystal Shops (and cosmopolitan) and the Bellagio.  Overall had a good time. Check in might take a while but that’s bc of the many guests.
50,Great location on the strip. The casino is small but has a bit for everyone. Eataly had delicious food options on site however they closed early and some areas were not as attentive to customers as others were. The line for coffee in the morning was ridiculous.
40,Room was clean. Water pressure good. Check in fast once we got a room that wasn't occupied by someone else. LOL. Usually stay at Planet Hollywood but after reading recent PH reviews we decided on Park. Location not as good as PH but that side of the street is a lot cleaner. LV really needs to do something about getting the crazies and homeless off the PH side of LV Blvd. Park doesn't offer a good variety of restaurants but NY is next door and close if you go out the side exit byLaLa Noodle and enter the side entrance at NY. Casino is clean but smaller than most. Eataly looks to me like an expensive food court. It was nice to be in a smoke free hotel and casino. If Caesars properties don't clean up their act we'll stay at Park again next year.
40,Park MGM is a great location if you are going to see a concert at the Park MGM Theater. The entrance is located within the casino so you don't need to go outside of the hotel. Room facing strip (higher floor) was a great view and the window sofa is an added touch. Loved the huge bathroom shower!
50,Great stay wonderful hotel. Really quiet clean. I was in a room with a view of the Strip. Hotel is centrally located so I had tons of food options. I would definitely stay here again next time I’m in Vegas.
40,Overall it’s a nice hotel and casino. Eataly and the Parks location are its main selling points to me. Good service throughout the property. Could use some easier options for meals but overall a good stay.
50,Park MGM is perfect for families as its nonsmoking policy makes it great for young children. The location is perfect and convenient to everything. I love LaLa Noodles and can’t wait to try the Italian Eatery on my next trip.
40,We went for a last minute vegas trip and the park mgm was half the cost of most resorts with equivalent amenities. The rooms were clean and pool was nice. The tram between the aria and bellagio was also another great benefit
50,Being in a full non smoking property gave me the peace of mind. Didn’t have to worry about throat and eye irritation from smoke. Staff is top notch. Always ready to help. Most appreciated is no smell of weed!!
50,It’s in a great location good choice of slot machines good restaurants and nice and clean!!! The location is right next to New York New York and T-Mobile Arena for sports and concerts as well. Favorite spot on the strip!
50,We really liked the resort. It is in a great location on the strip. The tram to the aria and Bellagio was convenient. The room was nice and clean. We wished there was a refrigerator in the room but otherwise is great.
50,I love the park atmosphere throughout the hotel. I truly appreciate that it’s a non smoking environment. The food is fantastic go see silk sonic at the Dolby. There’s not a bad seat. On the record was a blast for after the show.
20,Honestly  I wasn’t expecting much for 150 a night but I wanted to be close to the venue that the silk sonic concert was being held .  Rooms . Minimum . No coffee  no fridge  uncomfortable bed  ugly sparse weird colors and deco . outstanding shower and water pressure .  Jonathon at the vip check in and Ulysses were great . Very customer services oriented . Jesse from the primrose cafe . Wonderful . Great service  friendly professional . That’s it everyone else we came in contact with . Was inept . We got locked out of our room and when my husband went to get new keys they told him he wasn’t listed on the room ! Wrong ! This one thing made us late to dinner and a show …  The club after the concert. “ Off the record “ could have been a blast . Great dj good vibe  cool decor . Unfortunately the customer service at the entrance Killed if for us . We waited an hour to get in only to have our id demanded . We are 6o years old ! Staying at the hotel  seeing a concert (that didn’t allow phones so we left everything in the room … It is a ridiculous policy that  doesn’t allow employees to use common sense in each situation … thanks a lot guys. Way to make ladies feel special . Angel and Patrick need to be replaced by a crew who understands how to deal with special situations ..  stay here for convenience to a concert but expect nothing and you will be ok .  concierge …. Terrible . In 4 days I saw one at the desk on my way out and the ones that answered the phones . Useless . Asked a question twice … no call back no answer … a good concierge is sooooo important to the property .. sorry . Totally lacking .
30,Very unimpressed.rooms were very bare. Bathroom was nice hated the sliding pocket door bed was very uncomfortable  Worse casino I have ever played in. Food options were very scarce couldn’t get coffee anywhere after 11 pm
50,I've stayed at this property a few times and each time was excellent. I like the proximity to the MGM Grand and New York New York. The rooms are modern and nicely laid out. Park MGM has megastar performers.
10,The shower was dirty with globs of hair stuck to the wall. The shower floor had black stains or mold on it. Dirty windows where you could barely see through. They said they were giving me a strip view but I got the top of a lower building. The air vent was full of dirt and lent. If you had allergies you might have some serious problems. The room was not the room I reserved online. They claimed that a room will be saved for me but not necessarily the one I chose online. That’s BS!
50,Was happy my kids loved that it looked “fancy” the room was spacious & the bathroom was updated we had a great view looking at Coke & M&M the room smelled cleaned & there was no smoking that was the best part!
50,I just want to say thank you to all stuff members of Park MGM for exceptional service they provided while I was in the hotel. Clean room fast and easy communication with guest service. I’m fully satisfied with my trip! Appreciate!!
50,Once you enter the hotel. it was smell so good clean and the staffs are so friendly. The Park Mgm is on good location on the Strip. I had a good sleep and experience during my 3 days. The room is quite small but very relaxing.
50,$65 / night is a great price for room 108 on the 17th floor.    Check in and check out was easy.    The WiFi was great.    The dual-head walk-in shower was very convenient.    The WiFi help line was very helpful and answered my question quickly.
50,I flew is for a quick trip to see Silk Sonic and Park MGM did not disappoint! This was my second time staying at the hotel the first being during renovations and it was great to see the hotel fully complete. It’s not a large hotel by vegas standards and everything is easy to get to without feeling like you’re walking a country mile. Great food option and spa! I also love the pool! It has a very chill vibe.
50,Very clean very friendly staff. Love the smoke free atmosphere. Was the second time have stayed. Very convenient location. Pool was very nice. Love the convenience and the food we ate at early Layla noodles and primrose I Would recommend the Park MGM!
10,Check-in head up to the room and someone was already checked in with their luggage out laptop and money on the table. Called the front desk and was told to leave or they would call security when it was Park MGM's fault. Huge liability for both me and the poor guy who already had the room. Then had to go all the way down get new keys and the whole experience cost me an additional 30 mins and we were late for our reservation. Great first night for $400 a night probably staying somewhere else in the future. Maybe a place that has a refrigerator and drawers in the room.
50,Overall great experience had a billing issue but the manager was able to resolve it. It was clean and the service was great. I would highly recommend becoming a rewards member. It offers great perks and discounts.
40,We had a good room and decent view. Love the black out curtains and room was quiet at night. Eatily was great to visit as a nice meal option when all the restaurants are packed. The no smoking casino was great. No cigarettes no cigar or pot smoke was a relief from the rest of the strip.
30,"Came back to untidy room 1st night & had to call to ask for at least some fresh towels. Were not informed that you had to ""request"" housekeeping.The exorbitant resort fee is not justified in my opinion as there is no bottled water no coffee maker no free parking and it was necessary to beg for standard items like fresh towels fresh drinking glasses and Kleenex."
50,Great location. It is completely smoke free now. If you have a smoker in your party just 3 minutes to New York so everyone is accommodated. If you know how to navigate from hotel to hotel this is a great location. Took about 15 minutes to get to Harahs for a show. Good food choices.
50,We spent a week combining pleasure with work. We always stay at the Park we have been in other properties and just like the clean smoke free environment of the Park. The only thing I wish the park had was a food court for more on the go style with more varieties that other properties seem to have. It's not convenient to have to hunt down fast foods somewhere else. Starbucks didn't offer a full menu it was too limited.
30,The hotel is a good location but needs to be updated. Very dark and old looking hallways and rooms. Mattress’s very soft and not very comfortable. The air conditioner broke in our room and heard other people had this same issue. The bathroom was dirty when we arrived with hair in the corners. The room didn’t have refrigerator so you can’t keep anything cold.
50,This place was always a pit stop between the other larger MGM properties for me. But after staying there on a weekend comp I am rethinking my view on Park MGM. For me this is the epicenter of the strip. The dizzying array of dining choices and location make this an excellent choice for a rewarding vacation location
50,Great staff all over the property loved the BJ dealers and pit boss’. Am already looking forward to our next visit and hoping to finally win some money lol. I have already recommended to multiple friends and they will be staying there in 2 weeks
50,Always stay at the the MGM Grand. Got tired of the lack of room update and hustle and bustle of more people staying there. Also location has gotten less desirable. MGM Park is smoke free updated (well) and the location between Cosmo and NYNY is amazing. Will stay here again!
40,The room was decent bathrooms were nice with a decent size shower. I would stay here again. The food options were pretty good but with no refrigerator or microwave I was hesitant to bring food back to the room
50,loved everything about my stay the food was over the top next time i stay in Vegas it will be the park MGM for sure. The staff was really nice and helpful. I would tell all my friends that this is the place to stay.
50,First time staying there and it was wonderful! Rooms were great and the staff was courteous and helpful! Rooms felt like they had just been renovated. Central location to other MGM hotels which made it easier to get to all of them.
50,Smoke free casino. Great location. Cute rooms. Wine tasting at Eataly. Bavette’s Starbucks Junipers and so much more. Oh and I can’t forget one of my favorite brunch locations Primrose. Park MGM has it all! My favorite place to stay in Vegas!!
50,Very nice hotel. Great location. Rooms are nice. Have a lot of restaurants and stores. Valet parking. Have 3 outdoor pools but downfall closes at 5pm. Had nice view of the strip. Charges $100 per night deposit.
50,The stay was fantastic as was the restaurants and the staff! The hotel is centrally located which is very helpful if you would like to walk the strip and visit other hotel lobbies. Highly recommend Park MGM!
50,Had so much fun! Casino is smoke free Eataly is a fabulous place to find food! Rooms are very nice and clean. If you need anything or need directions someone is always available. Great location on the Strip!
50,Love this hotel. It’s clean convenient reasonably priced. The staff were great. However the wait at the bell desk for service was terrible. At least 20 people in line one person taking bags and not doing so very fast.
10,Probably avoid if you can. Our first room had an over flowing sink that required hours to fix and was disgusting. (Think extra large snake drain and gross hair and debris pulled up from the sink.) moved to another room in the middle of the night. Was told by front desk that night was comped. Then upon checkout manager refused to honor the concession because new staff member made a mistake. I could pay $500 a night somewhere much nicer without the plumbing tutorial.
50,Rooms are clean and parking is worth the extra money.  It was a good gambling environment - fun games.  Check in was fast - I used the self check in to print my key cards.  Only complaint was I couldn’t stay longer.
50,Was pleasantly surprised how clean and comfortable the Park MGM was. Last time I stayed here it was the Monte Carlo and I wasn't impressed. The new and fresh resort was well worth it. Eataly area had great options. Casino was smoke-free and very clean. Enjoyed my stay.
50,2nd time at the Park MGM. Will always try and book here. Non-smoking clean good service and close amenities. Only downfall is no fridge or way to keep water cold. I will be back when I need to come for work or pleasure
50,Very clean very homey kind of hotel.  This place feels very high end without the high end pricing.  Seated perfectly in the middle of the strip so you can access other casinos that are close.  The tram is also right there!
50,Selected this hotel with my MGM rewards for an overnight business trip. Was pleasantly surprised how clean efficient check in/check out and convenience of this resort was I would definitely stay at this MGM property again.
40,Came to Vegas for March Madness to experience the conference tourneys and then the opening weekend of March Madness. This hotel has a great location for those in town going to TMobile. Also easy access to other MGM properties and tons a restaurants in the hotel and nearby. The casino is nice tons of slots only knock is the drink pricing is a little high but other than that I would stay here again. Easy check-in and check-out process with a very friendly staff.
10,Vegas is a huge waste of time and money don't bother coming find somewhere else better to go take a cruise or go to Disney world or something the food is crap had food poisoning to different times and everything is way over priced and not worth your hard earned dollar
50,Enjoyed our stay at ParkMGM! Great location on the strip and very friendly staff. Smoke free was a big plus! Would recommend and will return! We enjoyed the Primrose hotel in ParkMGM and had a great view from the hotel window!
50,I feel it's a great location on the strip. It was very easy to get from the stip to the elevators to the rooms. You didn't have to walk a mile or go through a casino maze to get to the room. Even though it seemed there weren't many restaurant selections there were so many choices right next door at NYNY an MGM property.
50,Park MGM is a fantastic hotel with clean rooms & great amenities. Close to the strip and numerous restaurants. Would recommend to my friends and family definitely stay here again. Thanks for the great time!
50,The Park MGM offers great service affordable rates and a smoke free casino and hotel on the strip while ensuring patrons have a good time without smelling like cigarettes at the end of the day. Our room located on the 15th floor overlooked the T-Mobile arena without the noise of traffic. During events a couple of concerts could be heard but nothing that kept us awake. One strange note: You can heard the rooms next door when they lower and lift their curtains using the pulley chain. It can be startling in the middle of the night.
50,Staying at the Park MGM was the best trip. Joseph in concierge services made everything we requested happen. Transportation dinner spa and pool reservations all I had to do was pick up the phone or email Joseph and he took care of the rest. He even emailed us during our stay to see how everything was going and if we needed anything. I will definitely continue contacting Joseph!
40,Check in was easy. Room was great for price. Black jack tables we good price and great dealers. Woke up to bouncing balls @5:30 am. And noon I stayed on the third floor. Not sure if a gym was nearby. But would stay again on a higher floor.
50,thank you the St. Pat day experience with the NCAA games all combined into one great weekend. Expect to return again this year to celebrate holidays and birthdays coming up. This is one the prime locations to stay and celebrate Las Vegas!
50,Overall best smoke free hotel in Vegas. So clean and all of the staff was beyond friendly. Will definitely return. Already planning on returning in July and again in October. Loved the pools. Enjoyed all the restaurant options as well
50,We loved that we didn’t have to deal with smoke in the casino and the tram was really convenient. I picked this place because I was traveling with my parents. They were able to get around well thanks to the tram and never felt overwhelmed.
50,From Sarah who greeting me when I checked in with outstanding service and kindness to the cleanliness of the room through the smoke free environment.....it was outstanding. The casino is very clean bartenders very friendly and the dealers polite it made the experience just very enjoyable. Plan to go back there again.
50,You really notice how clean and no smoking smell at Park when you visit other hotels. The tram to Bellagio was super convenient. Silk Sonic show was Amazing!! The Stay Well room was worth it. Mattress air purifier and water filters were appreciated and made travel experience a lot easier.
50,Was in and out. No issue and had fun. I forgot tooth paste and tooth brush and they provided when i asked. The casino is clean and had servers providing all day and night. Will definitely go back and stay again
40,We normally stay elsewhere but I really wanted to be some place where we could escape the smoke & it was heaven! We upgraded to a Nighthawk Suite do it just do it. Worth the extra dollars as being able to spread out is nice. The shower the water pressure---worth all the money you win downstairs in the casino!
50,Clean updated FOOD is GREAT! Good venue for shows. Excellent rewards program. SMOKE FREE!! Rooms are spacious and the location is perfect for seeing shows. Pools are lovely and the service there was perfection!!
10,There was a used condom under the table. Found it when we were packing two nights later. I did move the table from its original position where it had made a deep dent showing that nobody ever moves it to clean. That was disgusting!!!!
30,Checked in they told me room wasn’t ready until  Got the manager involved then it was ready.. my room tv was hanging side ways about to fall till I contacted to maintenance ppl. My luggage got to my room 45min after I was in there..
30,Not happy staff was rude and did not make me feel welcomed I am very disappointed with my experience there.I would not recommend this hotel unless your looking for smoke free that is the only perk .I have stayed at multiple mlife casinos and this is the first time I’ve had a bad check in experience
30,"Overall had a good experience. Decent rooms great Spa. Good location. But the staff member we interacted with at Bell Service was so rude. He obviously didn't like his job and shouldn't be dealing with customers. He should be in an office where he doesn't provide customer service. He made it painful to drop off bags at Bell Services. I didn't tip him due to his attitude and he says ""I did all that for nothing"".....ummm hello he's getting paid hourly and that's his whole job description to help with guests bags. You get tips on good service not as a default for being present."
50,My complaints are just nit picky and me just being impatient. Overall great experience all around. Clean rooms smoke free casino easy to get around. Workers were very helpful and kind. I would definitely revisit.
10,~$200/night rate ended up being ~$300 with all their fees and taxes for basic old room with NO Amenities. No coffee no cups no fridge no microwave. They even make you purchase something to get a cup of tap water. Rooms are dated . Room darkening shades are the only good thing. Will never stay there again not at all family friendly. Had to stay there via sports tournament travel agency. This whole area is so greedy. Waste of money for sure
50,Fantastic location. Very easy and convenient non-contact check-in and check-out. Parking garage always had lots of spots. Clean rooms. Great restaurants and is the only non-smoking resort. Highly recommend!
50,When the classic parts of the strip age and show it the Park MGM is a sleek comfortable cool place to hang out as well as sleep. The rooms were comfortable and the casino/sportsbook had some of the most attentive customer service I've experienced.
50,We had a very pleasant stay. People were very helpful and nice to deal with. Rooms could use an update. Wish there were more stores but loved that it was a smoke free property. It was a great time for all my family.
10,Bad experience from check in until departure. Will not be staying at park mgm again. I’ve stayed at pretty much all other mgm resorts and never had such a poor experience. Really disappointed in mgm..
50,Great Location in the middle of the strip. Having direct access to Aria casino and restaurants was fantastic you can walk from Mandalay Bay to Bellagio and only have to go outside for a few moments (tram at Aria)
20,Rooms keys only worked 50% of the time. Twice I got a 10 minute ride on the elevator due to key issues. Very expensive food and drinks. There was no dresser in the room and I could go on and on. And aplenty I need more characters. We had lighting issues in the room when if which was never resolved yet we addressed it every day
40,This review is on Park MGM suite room since I never stay in the suite at Park MGM. Needless to say it is quite larger then the regular room and that includes the bathroom also quite larger. Its a comfortable place to say although I don't see the logic of having two TV on opposite sides of the room. Walkin closet is a size of small room itself. Housekeeping folks were great as well as the desk crew. People at Park MGM are great folks. So what is really wrong with this suite......it doesn't have a mini refrigerator!!!!! Bad enough that the regular took don't have one but even the suites don't have one???? I wonder if Park MGM is the only casino-hotel on the strip that don't provide their guests with a mini-refrigerator??? And I have to admit the bed wasn't that comfortable. I had some back issues coming back from Vegas.
50,Had tickets to see the Knights and decided to stay on the strip for the night. Park MGM was basically across the street from T-Mobile. The room was spacious and clean. Mobile check-in and check-out was easy as it can get!
50,After not going anywhere and staying to ourselves for two years because of the global pandemic we decided to finally venture out. The Park MGM was not only clean well maintained and smoke free but it had much less traffic coming through than other hotels on the strip. The Park MGM is located right across the street from the T-Mobile Arena. If you are going to any event there this would be the perfect hotel for you. There is a parking garage right across the street as well. You can prepay or pay on your departure ($15 per night). From the front entrance of the hotel you can cross the street to the New York New York as well as a little cluster of food-truck-like establishments. Among those you will see are the Hello Kitty Cafe and Beer Haus. This hotel also has access to the ARIA tram. The only negative I found was there was no refrigerator in our room. We stayed in the Park King for reference. Overall that was not enough to give this hotel a subpar rating. It was great and the rates are pretty great too!
10,The lobby is nice other than that the hallway is very dark and ceiling is very low. I've been staying in both Caesars and MGM and I would say besides Aria Vdara and Bellagio I wouldn't stay in any other MGM branded property. Funny they charge me early check out fee because I just don't feel comfortable moving. I ended up move to conrad and waldorf astoria.
50,This hotel is great for the family. My son had fun in the heated pools. The staff was friendly and very helpful at all times. I would definitely recommend The Park MGM to friends and family. The restaurants were very good as well and the location was just right.
50,Picked because of mgm rewards. Was very happy with staff and events at location. The main casino was on the small side but had everything. Adult pool was great location to the bar and restrooms and heated but only one hot tub.
50,I booked the free to night's from the myvegas app and honestly the beds were so comfy I had to get a new mattress that was similar to the on park mgm had! Friendly staff all over! And best part was that there was no smoking inside the casino or hotel!
50,Massive decision on which hotel to choose for our short stay in Vegas. We made the right decision with Park MGM. Our room king with view of strip was flawless. The room was spacious with sofa and walk in shower the room was exceptionally clean and modern.  The views from the 28th floor were stunning and despite visiting during spring break and st Patrick’s day we were not disturbed by anyone during the night  This place is a must and if we returned to vegas this is where we would stay again
50,Thank you Park MGM Resort for taking a stance in favor of clean smoke free air for everyone !! What a delight. I hope and pray that other casinos will follow your lead and adapt to the Smoke Free policy throughout the building and the casino.    Rooms were clean and updated. Pool area was very fun!!    Thanks again for a awesome experience. Went to see Bruno Mars-Silk Sonic. Awesome Show
10,Front desk is absolutely horrible. Manager hung up on me! Terrible customer service. If you have friends staying at the same hotel and they stay on a different floor don’t bother trying to see them because you can’t. My friend and I BOTH called the front desk. Didn’t matter. Manager was rude and hung up.
30,Just because we had the same name as another guest with our confirmation number there should never been a mix up. All this technology on shows how easy it is to rip anybody off. What if that person left the day before had we done the self check out we would have been charged their bill.
30,The no smoking aspect was the best part. Location is good. Theyvarevstill challenged heavily with getting alcohol yet those brands are in every store there. Staff told me it's been months since they have seen crown royal. Rooms are ehhhh. Not exciting just a room.
50,Lovely boutique property with great dining options. Eataly is by far the best food court option available in Vegas. Clean rooms and amenities are well maintained. Silk Sonic show was outstanding. Location makes strip easily accessible. Weather was lovely during our stay.
50,We stayed here for a concert event and anniversary. It was our first time and we were thrilled with the staff and their kindness attentiveness and willingness to help us out at anytime. The room was good for what we needed and we have zero complaints smoke free casino was a huge BONUS!
40,Pricey for average quality stay. Should offer more perks for reward members. Staff at front desk does not acknowledge rewards members. Hallways are dark and the rooms can use some updating. Location is good.
50,hotel is smoke free and so pleasant to not stink like cigarettes when you leave. perfect location on the strip. good restaurants. the blinds make a little noise when going up and down you can hear them from the other rooms.
40,We were attending Bruno Mars and Silk Sonic's show at the Dolby Theater in the same facility and decided - mainly due to a cheaper cost - of just staying at this property. Overall a quite good experience. The room we reserved wasn't available for the first night of our trip which was a slight annoyance but other than that the staff was very courteous and helpful. This is a bit of a no-thrills resort especially compared to other places I've stayed on the northern end of the Strip like Wynn and Resorts World. Still if you're attending a concert in the same venue or going to an even at the arena next door it's a hard location to beat and the rooms which quite plain are certainly serviceable.
50,We are so impressed with this hotel! It was beautiful clean and updated but more than that…the service was amazing!!  We called from our room (several times) for extra linens locked out of our safe more TP etc and they were super friendly and FAST!! I don’t think I’ve ever had service to my room this fast and I’ve stayed at other hotels on the strip.  The room was perfect super clean and beds were newer. The Stay Well room has memory foam beds that felt a bit hard but we slept like babies.  I was traveling with my husband and my two adult daughters. My husband and I used comps from MyVEGAS for a free 2 night stay. At check in our room reservations were linked so that we could stay in one room and not move after two days and we were upgraded to stay well without asking! We were given a beautiful view of NYNY Excalibur Mandalay Bay and the T Mobile arena as PARK MGM doesn’t have a front strip view. We got to watch the NYNY roller coaster which was fun!  I highly recommend this hotel! We will definitely be staying here again.
50,Loved our room compliments of MGM rewards and the non smoking casino is the best...only complaint is that it's soo cold in casino...so I just had a jacket or sweatshirt on. Love the area of the strip it's on.
40,We chose the Park MGM because of the smoke-free atmosphere including the casino. We don't spend a lot of time in the casinos generally but it was nice to be able to play some blackjack or even just a morning coffee run and not smell like smoke afterwards.    For the price I expected a bit more from the rooms. We stayed in a Stay Well room with an air purifier (great for white noise at night which most hotels lack) and other amenities. The upgraded mattress was super firm. AC struggled to keep the room cool I'd guess it will really have trouble in the summer heat. It's obviously just a remodel from the old Monte Carlo rooms more comparable to Vegas hotels half this price. Everything was clean and at a bit lower rate it would be more fitting. The smoke-free atmosphere is worth a premium as well. Five star environment three star room.    There was a hockey game one evening and a DJ outside for a few hours before playing music which was quite loud even on the 23rd floor. You could feel the bass in the room we had to head out to get away from the noise.    Eataly food court was okay. Lavazza coffee was great shorter line and better coffee than the Starbucks in the casino. La Pasta Fresca was bland. Everything is overpriced but that's Vegas.
50,Stayed at Park for 311 Day and was not disappointed. Super convenient when leaving the Dolby theater. Love having the Starbucks and gift shop not far from the elevators. Had a fantastic brunch at Primrose. Best bartenders ever! The room was clean bed was comfortable shower was huge. Housekeeping was great. I will absolutely stay there again.
40,Overall I had a great stay. The water pressure is second to none. The pools are perfect and the restaurants located inside are tremendous I especially loved Lala Noodle. A great location on the strip
50,The bed was very comfy! The view was beautiful. We had concerts across the street and a block over so a short fun walk away. And the hallways had wallpaper with hummingbirds and dragonflies which are my favorite mystical signs!
40,Smoke free rooms and casino with a great mid-strip location. Friendly staff especially at the concierge desk but also just polite greetings from staff walking around the property. The location was probably the best though as it was literally mid/strip with a bus stop and a walkway to get to across to shopping right outside. It also has a free tram taking you to more shopping and to another hotel.
20,The Park MGM did not meet my expectations or standards. The room was dated worn and dusty. There was food/snack crumbs on the floor the closest was far too small for 2 people and the bathroom sink and shower experienced slow draining. Temperature was also difficult to regulate. I did enjoy that the property was non-smoking and Eataly was a plus.
20,If you ask for early check in and pay for it don’t bother it is still from 11 to 1 and no guarantee that you will even get it. The same goes for late check out. While the staff tries to accommodate us they fell flat because they could not do anything except give a credit or offer food voucher. We did not take the voucher what we wanted was what we were promised and paid for which was early checkin and late check out. They did credit fee but the inconvenience of it all was stressful after a long flight with children.
50,The Park MGM in my opinion could not be in a better location. The Dolby Live is attached to the hotel it's across the street from the T-Mobile Center and an easy 10-15 walk to other popular properties like Aria and the Cosmo. Eataly is also on the property which is also a huge plus!
40,Great property & friendly staff. The hotel is located near shops and restaurants.    The room waa very clean with comfortable beds. I do however think MGM could afford to update their rooms. The lack of a modern update want prevent us from coming back.    We will be back soon.
50,Love this place favorite place to stay while in Vegas. Love dining on site at Bavette's. Clean & smoke free which is the best for those of us with allergies. Service while gaming is on spot great choices.
50,Great location. The rooms are comfortable but dark. The hallways are also dark. The ambience is very nice in Eataly but the food falls short. The servings are small and the wine per glass is pricey. Love that this is a smoke free casino and hotel. The staff is very attentive.
50,The Park MGM is just a great place to stay. Location staff rooms gaming dinning. It has the full package of what we look for when in Vegas. The pools are a great place to relax and enjoy a nice cocktail.
10,"It's one thing to be smoke free it's another to be anti-smokers. After being stuck in an elevator for 20 minutes because of the buggy app I go to the front desk to ask for hard keys to my room. Yes I have an unlit cigarette hanging out my mouth because I am STRESSED. Front desk guy on the evening of 3/11 tells me. ""You can't have that in your mouth. This is a smoke free property."" Bro I paid over $300 a night to stay here. This is Vegas. I'll put whatever I want in my mouth!!!!"
50,Park MGM was a great place to stay. The pool areas were nice and clean. Drink service at the pool was wonderful. It is a great location if you are wanting to walk the strip or go to the Knights game!
50,I was impressed right from when I made a last-minute reservation at the front desk through the very easy checkout. The front desk staff was very helpful for both reserving and checking in and I was given a nice room with an excellent view for a good price (though the Resort Fees and taxes made the price a lot higher than the originally quoted price - not the fault of the resort). The location with the tram to the heart of the Strip was really good and the Eataly food court at Park MGM and the New York food court directly across the street were both excellent. Access to the lobby and elevators from self-parking was quite convenient. The up elevator from the lobby to the self-parking walkway was broken - that’s the only negative I found. Great stay most enjoyable. Best stay of the three hotels I stayed in for my week in Las Vegas.
50,Park MGM rooms were spotless! Love the non-smoking environment. The addition of Eataly is so convenient. It's great that we could do a take out order and bring it up to our room to enjoy and relax. Patisserie pastries were so cute and tasty.
50,Hotel smells like a spa it's non-smoking. The rooms are clean and the beds are crazy comfortable. The shower is amazing. The staff is friendly and helpful. I love how my room was set up with bench/couch seating along the window a big round table to get work done and enough space to move around. Highly recommend if you want a hotel that's clean and quiet and slightly off the strip away from the hustle and bustle.
40,The no smoking part was the best part. Never went into another casino for 4 days just so we wouldn’t stink of cigarette smoke. Like everything in Vegas everything is very expensive. Go a little way off the strip or downtown for decent food at fairer prices.
50,Clean rooms close to everything nice showers. We were able to walk to most of our destinations. Also great pricing with the package deal. I will definitely be using Park MGM on our next trip! The casino was also very clean and nice
50,It was so nice to stay at a smoke free hotel! I like that is not too big. Easy to get anywhere in the hotel. The tram to Bellagio is near the guest elevators which was great. Primrose was awesome for breakfast. I would stay here again!
50,Was in town for PAC-12 tournament. Great location clean room and love the dining options. Walking distance to arena was great and parking easy to navigate. Overall great experience and we plan to be back soon.
50,MGM is the best Casino in Las Vegas hands down. From Valet to Check in and out Every time we visit we can’t wait to come back and do it all over again and the only Casinos we consider staying at is MGM!!!
30,A lot of disappointments on trip long lines for casino and elevator poor sleeping experience from the weed smell and not great cleaning while staying in the rooms overall would try a different hotel on our next stay
50,Perfect! Loved my room was clean had a nice view bed was super comfortable. My concert was right downstairs. Starbucks conveniently placed right outside the guest elevators. Good location on the strip pretty centered and lots of things in easy walking distance.
50,excellent we enjoined the place and city all family were happy  I would like to continue receiving offers from you guys so I can continue bringing my family's.    something to recommending is to not allow people smocking inside it's causing a lot allergies.
50,Had a great time. Facilities and staff were excellent. After 3 days enjoying the Park MGM my flight home was cancelled. I was doubtful that I could get an extra night because it was a weekend and the hotel was so busy. The amazing staff not only arranged an extension but there was no need to change rooms. What could have been a problem was not! Thank you so much for your hospitality!
50,The room was clean with an amazing view. It was very quiet and the staff was courteous and very helpful. Good food court especially if you enjoy Italian foods and treats. I would recommend this hotel.
50,Accommodations were great. Room cleaned everyday and the digital door lock made room access quick and secure. Check in counter personnel were courteous and helpful. I consider the hotel a first class operation.
50,Our stay at MGM Vegas went very well. We were able to check in early on our first day. We noticed right away that this was the only non smoking casino and hotel on the strip. The location in the middle of the strip was also great.We were able to walk to Top Golf and take free trams to Mandalay Bay and Bellagio. There was plenty of help when it was time to take taxis or ubers. We enjoyed eating at different restaurants in the building. Will stay there next time I go.
50,Love the location. Great restaurants and friendly and knowledgeable staff. Met friends there and we were able to get adjoining rooms. Our friends also had a great time and enjoyed the location. We will definitely be coming back soon.
50,Perfect location on the strip..especially if you’re planning to take in a Golden Knights game. HUGE fan of the NON smoking hotel and casino…. Clean rooms helpful staff love that Eataly is right there.
50,Beautiful room with a King size bed sofa and table. All staff we interacted with was friendly and helpful. Great choice of restaurants. Fun casino games. Time spent in our room was well sound proofed from major rvent happening at T-mobile stadium. Parking isn't free unless you have a MGM credit card or pearl status.
40,Overall very good. Clean Hotel and Room's great location Especially Eatley facilities with lots of  Great choices for food drinks etc. We always stay here when ever we come to Las Vegas. Overall Employees are helpful.
50,Check in was quick and painless. Our room was spacious and clean with a long couch in front of the window overlooking the pool. The Eatly dining area has such a great selection we wanted to try more but our trip was only 3 nights long.
50,Always enjoy staying at Park MGM. Great location gaming shows food and excellent value for the $. Tram to Bellagio and Mandaly great perks. Non smoking great pool sauna and workout facilities. Eataly great new choices
50,Great location. Very clean love it’s smoke free in the casino and hotel. Crack shack is a chicken joint attached to it and it’s amazing would recommend 10/10. Love the tram attached to back of hotel that is a free ride to any casino on that side of the street.
50,We have stayed at ParkMGM (formerly Monte Carlo) for many years.  Previously we had stayed at several other casinos but now always return to the Park.  The hotel and casino floor are easy to navigate and uncomplicated unlike some of  the larger facilities. It is clean and all of the personnel are helpful and the smoke-free atmosphere is a major plus. A bus stop is in the front of the hotel. Travel to other MGM properties by tram is convenient. It is also close to the arena for events.  arena for events.
50,Outstanding customer service and very clean. From the moment we pulled onto the property everything was easily marked where to go and any worker you spoke with was helpful. My husband broke his ankle while in Vegas the bell staff was so helpful and accommodating getting us the help we needed.
50,Loved the location! Love that it’s smoke free the app to check-in and check-out room service was great and the tram into Bellagio. We will stay there again for sure! We saw SilkSonic perform at Dolby Live when we visited.
50,Had a great stay been here many times and always had a great stay great Location on the Vegas stip and won some money too . Room was very clean and staff was very friendly. Pool was renovated a few years ago very spa like atmosphere and very quiet
10,The place is just ok. I hope you don’t want a drink because the drink service is nonexistent. Wallpaper is falling off the walls in the hallways. Safe didn’t work in the room. The cleaning of the whole hotel needs work!
40,Really liked the location and the smoke-free environment. Gaming tables were fine and decent selection of restaurants. Room was comfortable but furniture seemed dated and color scheme was a bit depressing.
40,Great resort overall. Rooms do not have refrigerators or microwaves which I did not realize until I got there (my fault). The service was pretty prompt for everything except when we arrived our safe was broken and we called for service they were prompt in coming to the room to let us know they couldn’t fix it. They were going to send an engineer to replace the inner workings of the lock but never did after waiting an hour. so we left and carried our valuables with us that evening . When we returned nobody had been in the room because we had to be in the room for them to fix it which we didn’t know. So somebody else came up and said they couldn’t fix it till the next day. So the next day we had an hour and a half delay and starting our day waiting on the safe to be fixed. When you only have a couple days in Vegas that’s a little frustrating to lose several hours. The gentleman that fix the safe was very nice though. Room service was prompt in bringing towels and changing out a burnt bulb in our room. Other than a dried up chicken bone I found under the bed (disgusting) the room was very nice and the beds are very comfortable. Overall the resort is very nice has a lot of amenities to offer and is extremely close to a lot of really great things on the strip. I would recommend this hotel for families too because it’s non-smoking. I’m not a smoker and don’t like being around smoke because it gives me migraines so that was a plus for me.
50,Hotel was great! Clean and everyone was friendly from hotel staff to restaurants and casino. We went to Best Friend which was amazing food and I would definitely recommend getting a reservation for while you're there.
10,Digital Room key doesn’t work for elevator. Told at the check-in it is a “known issue.” Useless.    18 dollar Fiji water from room “bar”. 18 dollar water! I feel fleeced. Shame on MGM.    I hope they look at this. Except for these issues I would have been happy. The water thing especially soured me on my stay.
50,We kicked off spring break with a Golden Knights game and since bringing my child to Vegas a smoke free hotel was a must. Rooms are updated though on the smaller size (typical vegas size). The room Layout was well designed to maximize the space. It was comfy and would stay again with or without kids.    There’s something to be said about not having to walk through all that smoke as you do in some of the other hotels. Loved having a good hotel gym and the proximity to t mobile arena can’t be beat.
50,Attentive staff and great location. I had a great night sleep And woke up refreshed. Even the television channels were a good selection. I've been recommending park MGM to friends and family. I will definitely come back to stay.
50,Had a wonderful stay at Park MGM Las Vegas! From check in to check out the experience was wonderful. Clean facility excellent value smoke free property and friendly staff. Will definitely be back!!
50,We attended the 311 Day Ultimate VIP events that took place at Park MGM. All of the staff from security to housekeeping front of house and concierge were very helpful with all of our needs kind and made us feel comfortable during our stay.
40,The check-in was efficient and the staff friendly. The artwork throughout the facility was impressive and creative. Our concern was that the room was not cleaned during our stay. We were able to get clean towels upon requesting.
50,The Park MGM is the best resort as it is conveniently located near the middle of the other MGM resorts making it easy to see everything without having to walk very far. It is very clean. The staff are very friendly and extremely helpful.
20,"I am aware that the location is primo and that the ""resort fee"" is industry-standard but I dislike being extra fees for nothing; just call it a damn fee. I tried to find a cup of hot water (concierge told me I could get a kettle front desk and the casino bar thought I was crazy when I asked). While the hotel is smoke-free the air is stale and irritated my allergies. Windows are sealed shut and there are no fans to move out air (AC is included in those wonderful resort fees though!). Pool hours are only relevant for leisure travelers. I had a blood-stained towel but fortunately I just used the other ones. Great view of the strip though and a good-sized room!"
50,We booked two rooms. Check-in went smoothly and the hotel clerk was wonderful. We loved the smoke-free casino. It was so nice to gamble without the smell of cigarettes. Our room was clean and up-to-date. The beds were comfortable. This hotel is in a great location. We will definitely stay there again.
10,The first two floors here are beautiful the spa is lovely and the staff was nice too. The rooms (I stayed in a nighthawk suite) were not very clean loose carpet no security at the elevators creepy and dark hallways in the guest room area. I would recommend the Best Friend restaurant and gaming here nothing else.
50,Our room was very nice but it needed a fridge! Loved the Lighted long length mirror & makeup mirror! Bed was comfy with nice big pillows! Overlooked the pools which were not too busy at all! the hot tub was busy!
50,Had an amazing VIP experience with the band 311. The staff were very helpful and friendly. The casino was very clean and the people working seemed happier than other casinos in the area. I will stay again.
50,The food at the steakhouse was delicious. Everyone was sweet and nice including the bell boy. The room was wonderful and nice also. I loved the colors in the room. It was unique and different. The only thing I didn't like was the room didn't have a refrigator
40,We stayed here recently for the proximity to T-Mobile Arena. That was a big plus. Non-smoking was a definite plus. Staff was very friendly yet professional. Value was so-so. Rooms were modern and clean.
50,I have stayed here many times and it's always the best because it's at the center of everything.  I can take the tram to the bellagio or the shops. I can go see an event at the t-mobile arena or walk to other casinos
30,I love everything about Park MGM except the hotel rooms themselves. My most recent stay was by far the worst with no working phone stained sheets and a dirty water glass none of which were fixed during my stay. Because I had to physically walk to the front desk to communicate anything I gave up complaining after the first attempt.
40,This was our first time staying at Park MGM attending a special event. Two main reasons for booking Park MGM:  It was host hotel and it’s total smoke free! It was great being able to enjoy a meal in “Eataly” Casino and roam Hotel without having to inhale smoke or come back to room smelling like a cigarette! Primrose was great breakfast spot! The rooms along with the beds are “ok”. We had an issue with our room not being ready when we arrived at 1am after a long day of travel but they made the effort to correct.
50,Stayed for 5 nights for the PAC 12 Mens Basketball tournament. Hotel is very clean and best of all smoke free! Very convenient to T Mobile Arena. We had the Nighthawk Suite. Lots of room and fantastic shower pressure but no mini fridge which is disappointing unless you pay $30 more per night and no coffee maker. View is non strip and not great. No fan in the shower or bathroom so mirrors fog and no clock in the room. Workout room is fantastic. We would stay again because of the smoke free property and closeness to T Mobile Arena. Loved it overall.
40,We especially liked the smoke-free hotel and casino. Everything was clean. The location is good. New York New York is right next store and they have a lot of eating choices. The eating choices seemed limited at Park MGM unless you love fancy Italian food (Eataly). Long morning Starbucks lines. Pools looked great but too cold while we were there. Overall was a great experience!
50,We always stay at an MGM casino hotel so we earned enough players card points to get free suites. They were huge and beds where super comfortable. Food is a bit pricey not like the old Vegas. The quality of the food was great though. We will most likely stay there the next time.
50,Great place to have one of the best massages you'll ever have. Ali was my masseuse and although I've had my fill of massages around the world hers was by far the best I've ever had. I would definitely recommend her to anyone looking to have a great massage along with a super nice attitude.  Baba
50,My stay at the Park MGM was great. Good customer service and the rooms are lovely. Only negatives are that I had wait over two hours for my room to be ready and I wish you would bring back dj’s for your lounges
30,There’s no overcoming the low ceilings and dated stylings. The water pressure in the shower was exceptionally good. Love Eataly! There are lots of great bars in the resort and I wish I had a chance to try them all!
40,We drove over and stayed here for 2 nights after a stay in Anaheim. We had originally booked Excalibur but after reading the reviews we changed to the Park MGM. We arrived on a Thursday evening so check-in did not take too long. Our room was easy to find and overlooked the strip. The hallways were dimly lit (and extremely warm) but the room was clean and the beds were comfortable. We liked the fact it was a non-smoking hotel. There were a lot of food options. The location was very convenient to the things we planned to do in Las Vegas. I would not hesitate to stay here again.
40,Rooms are older and need to be reconditioned. Hallway to room also old and needs to be brightened up. Did not receive my 30$ per day food credit per costco travel booking. Casino lobby restaurants are very modern but rooms really need a reconditioning
50,We enjoyed the primrose for breakfast. Our suite was very comfortable. We enjoyed it. - one thing about room tho. We thought the bed was very low. We appreciated the expedited check in. The lady that helped us was very helpful. We were grateful for the tram between hotels. All in all it was a nice trip thanks to the MGM Park
40,My wife and I went to the John Mayer concert at the MGM Garden Arena and stayed across Las Vegas Blvd at the Park MGM. We drove from Arizona and use the mobile parking and check in from the app and everything went smooth. Room was very good and we enjoyed visiting Eataly.
20,Old fraternity brothers. The Park MGM was a no-go. Awful rooms Holiday inn express at most. Upgraded to the Nomad. Dining and breakfast options and quality of food lacking. Would not recommend. If gong Vegas again would upgrade to the Aria Venetian or similar.
40,MGM Park was very good not outstanding but a good value for the price. This was the old Monte Carlo hotel. So it's a rehab. The hallways are very dark. The gaming floor was a bit rambling and a little hard to navigate. Could use more restaurants. Something like a buffet of a breakfast & lunch cheep place. Eataly is over priced and has a different style of food.
50,We have stayed at the Park twice and love it. The walls may be a little thin but the rest of the experience was amazing. No smoking on the property not being gigantic thus a short walk to anywhere and the wonderful food on property. Can’t wait to go back again.
40,"The Park MGM is a beautiful clean and well-kept hotel with spacious rooms and comfortable beds. The entire hotel is 100% smoke free (including the casino) so it was a nice change of pace from the norm of your typical Las Vegas casino hotel. It is located right on the strip next to New York New York and Aria so you have access to other hotels and restaurants around you.    The restaurants in the hotel are a bit sparse however and many of them close early. We were shocked to discover that room service ended at 2pm while we were there. If you want any late-night food you will have to leave the hotel and find a restaurant on the strip. The main food offering at the Park is ""Eataly"" which is an Italian food court. There is also a Starbucks. There were other restauarant options in the hotel but many of them were closed while we were there.    The hotel is easy to navigate and we highly enjoyed how comfortable our room was. We also liked how there are separate elevators for different sections of floors (one for floors 1-11 one for floors 12-22 etc.) so you are never in an elevator for too long before finally getting to your floor.    It was a great stay that I would definitely do again in a future visit to Las Vegas."
50,I've never stayed at a hotel where every employee provided exceptional service until this stay at the Park MGM! The service combined with the clean smoke free casino and hotel eliminated the need to go anywhere else!
50,This was just a getaway for a few days. We are dinner at Eataly we had breakfast every morning at Primrose. The staff and waiters and waitress were really nice and friendly. And over all we had a great time.
30,"If you get $50 or actually any kind of credit in freeplay you must actually use some of your own money before you get to use the free play which is pretty stupid if you ask me. Then the ceiling on my floor not sure about the other floors but I bet they're all the same but ceiling was about 8' high. As someone that stands 6' 2"" a 8' ceiling is not the greatest that's like riding a roller coaster and knowing that you have to duck your head or maybe hit the crossbeam. There's also no Mini fridge in these rooms checking in Friday March 4rd and out on Sunday March 6th would have cost $809 if not comped through the rewards program. How is this gonna be an expensive hotel with no Mini fridge meanwhile super 8 Motel 6 Travelodge and all the other roach motels have a mini fridge?"
40,Overall good experience. Absolutely loved the non-smoking. Would have been better if slots paid better and food was cheaper. I still want to stay here again. Room was nice but bare minimum. Had room service daily.
50,Thank you so much Hank Graae for making my stay here so worth it! The security department is super kind and the atmosphere is great! I had a blast and I will certainly be coming back! Thank you again!
50,The Park MGM team did a great job during out stay. They were super-attentive to our needs and helped us with our granddaughter during a cold and windy day at the pool. All told just a great a very much appreciated experience
50,we had a wonderful time! We go all the time but the staff and experience was so good. Location is perfect right in the middle and the use of the tram is a good option by the end of the day when I was exhausted.
50,A simply beautiful and peaceful place to enjoy a vacation a conference wedding or other event. Being a non-smoking building is so refreshing...especially in Las Vegas. Staff is courteous and friendly.
40,Great only complaint mobile app for keyless entry to elevator and room failed more than once. Got an actual room key no more problems except no room services after 2pm how is that a thing in Vegas.
50,Can't beat the only non-smoking casino on the strip. Easy access to other casinos easy access to Frank Sinatra Boulevard to avoid driving up and down the strip. Stylish modern rooms. Centrally located to several MGM casinos to help you use just one player's card
50,Love the friendly staff. Rooms were clean and have good views. Property is close to everything that you will need on the strip. Everything is a short walking distance everywhere. We also tried Eataly marketplace which we enjoyed a lot. The only thing is that all the restaurants in the hotel were closed around 10 pm. I was looking for something to eat and there were no restaurants open. I wish that there will be some kind of a fast food place that is open 24 hours.
50,Great location super clean. Will definitely return soon. Love the green accent walls in the hotel room. ABSOLUTELY loved that it is a smoke free hotel and the perfume smell was not overpowering at all it smelt really nice and clean.
30,Only thing is they do not have a good selection of dining with in the hotel everything else was very convenient parking an elevator to rooms was not to far of a walk an was a quiet place. Bed was very comfortable!
50,Excellent stay. Nice location with properties next door. Dolby theater had shows. T mobile arena next door. Non smoking hotel. Renovations were nice and looks like a newer hotel. Would recommend if you like non smoking hotel. Also a tram is available on property to Bellagio. Families would do well here as well
50,Friendly Staff and great casino for Non smoking. Lala Noodle was great! The Pools are really great to have a drink and relax. Easy access to go to NYNY. As well as Aria. The pizza is amazing and they have great desserts.
30,Was told by front desk clerk she was sending me her favourite area of the hotel. Uh sure if you want to stare at ventilation. Terrible view but the hotel was clean enough. I should have moved rooms but was exhausted after arriving and felt weird asking after I stayed for a night. Great the hotel is non-smoking!
50,Loved it. The rooms were nice. It was close to alot of attractions. The casino was hitting....until it wasn't 😜😜. My only drawback is that I'm a smoker and the hotel and casino were both smoke free. Probably the only thing that would keep me from booking again 🤷🏾‍♀️🤷🏾‍♀️.
50,My husband and I love this casino. Staff if friendly and will go out of the way to be helpful. Rooms are clean and cleaning staff go out of their way to assist. Looking forward to our next return trip.
40,The park is very clean check in went well and overall the staff was friendly and helpful. I would recommend this place to others. There is plenty of places to eat on the property and the pools were clean and nice.
10,Location is very old and minimal done to improve rooms and common spaces. Felt very Cheap throughout the hotel. So many options in Vegas. This was the host hotel for an event so we chose to stay here due to that reason.
50,I have nothing but good things to say about the Park MGM. The staff (and I mean all the staff) were friendly and professional. The rooms were quiet. I never heard anyone in the halls or noise from adjoining rooms. The mattresses pillows and linens were all top notch. The smoke free property was a breath of fresh air in Vegas! And the food at Eataly was phenomenal. We had a great 4 day's at the resort and would definitely stay there again.
20,We had heard such great things about the MGM Park but come to find out it we were highly disappointing and unsatisfactory with the rooms and I would not recommend this property to anyone beware of hidden fees
40,Clean well maintained very good customer service. It’s not 5 star motel but the property is nice. Good pools. Housekeeping responded quickly to our requests for a replacement tv remote and for free towels.
30,Good rooms soft bed great pillows but the air conditioning left a lot to be desired it was soooo hot in the room didn’t seem like there was any air no matter how low I turned the thermostat. The hallways were very dimly lit and kinda creepy if you ask me but it the hotel was very clean and staff were very friendly I would definitely recommend if you like it warm. But me... I need air!
50,"This was a birthday trip! It was an awesome time! Park MGM has everything including a non-smoking casino! The food at the Primrose Restaurant was delicious and filling. The employees were always helpful and courteous! I didn""t have to travel to see SilkSonic I just went downstairs. It couldn't get better than that. It was AMAZING! I would definitely stay here again."
40,I will be staying at Park MGM again for sure. The stench of tobacco smoke and vaping was non-existence in my experience. I do wish they provided a refrigerator in the guest rooms. Best shower I have ever had in any hotel! Period.
40,May be the only non-smoking hotel in Las Vegas even at the casino. That was a huge plus for me. Great hotel overall the Eatery another plus. So many options right at the hotel and beautiful space too it reminded me of Mercado San Miguel in Madrid Spain.👌
50,Good non smoking hotel and casino. Nice Italian food and wine areas with good food and beverage options. Close to the strip and T Mobile. Staff is very friendly and accommodations are clean and comfortable.
10,Skip the MGM properties not worth the hassle. If they don't care about mega clients booking hundreds of rooms they won't care about a personal vacation. Very disappointing we definitely won't be staying again in the future
20,I was charged for parking and I didn't even have a car! I used Uber to and from the airport. I questioned the pending charges when I checked out and was told they would drop off. They didn't! Now I have to deal with the B.S.!
50,First of all….I love the fact that when you walk into the hotel you are not blasted with cigarette smoke onto your face. The hotel had friendly and attentive employees. The hotel is beautiful and the food from the different restaurants to just the little stands where hands down delicious. Overall one of the best experiences I’ve ever had at Las Vegas.
50,We celebrated our 40th wedding anniversary here and we felt special the whole time! Our room was big and beautiful food was great service was outstanding. Hoping to have another visit sometime soon!
50,Overall great experience. None smoking casino and hotel was an awesome aspect. Rooms had the blackout curtains which was great for sleeping shower pressure was another awesome part. Close enough to most all attractions and restaurants.
50,Didn’t know there were any non-smoking facilities in Vegas until I stayed here - a welcome respite. The room was exceptionally clean the staff was always very pleasant. Very good value for the Strip.
50,Excellent place to stay while visiting Las Vegas  it’s one of the few casinos that is smoke free very friendly helpful staff  excellent service very clean  would recommend this hotel to friends & family
40,The front desk and housekeeping are phenomenal and accommodating. We all laughed together. Front desk and housekeeping were friendly great energy and fast with service. I would come back just to interact with the Staff.
50,Great location and an easy walk to some Fabulous dining and entertainment! Only drawback is the traffic congestion in the area when something is going on at the T-Mobile arena. Be sure to check out Eataly!
50,No smoking near everything fun table games good food modern rooms saw Gaga here and the venue was perfect!! We loved this and will definitely be back again. Plus it’s part of MLife Rewards hotel group so military and vets get comps and a food voucher!
10,Bathroom sink clogged. Nobody responded to make a fix. Price point Vs. Value does not add up. Some roullet tables the dealers were rude and acted like they hated their jobs. Some dealers english was so bad I did not understand them.
40,It may not be the flashiest hotel on The Strip but it is clean with basic modern amenities nice staff nice pools and all in a very convenient location. Access to a nice variety of food options a free tram to and from the Aria and Bellagio and direct access to the Dolby (formerly Park) Theater have made this a great place to stay for short pleasure trips at an affordable price.
40,"Room was basic but clean. No frills no refrigerator. The ""sensored"" (50 second removal) mini bar was a bad joke. We were given a handicap accessible room even though we had no disability and didn't ask for one it was apparently the only king bed available at the time. There were no drawers in the room and shower/tub combo didn't seem very accessible if handicapped."
40,Park is a top flight hotel. If you will be in and out a lot especially by car this spot may not be it for you. T mobile arena is a gift and curse by being so dam close! Front desk & concierge staff A1! Rooms nicely kept
50,The staff at all the bars and restaurants  Provide excellent service..  Rob at the library bar makes thee best old fashioned .... The dealers are very knowledgeable on all the casino games ....  Rooms are spotless
50,Casual trip for a getaway and got to see a show while in town. Highly recommend staying here. So much to take in we will definitely be back and will fully consider staying here again. Until next time Vegas!!
30,I am an ambassador member of Marriott. i am accustomed to a level of service and basic amenities that i did not find here at the Park MGM. besides this i had made the reservation through Southwest and they screwed up the total nights stay. unfortunately the staff of the hotel would do nothing (except charge me for an extra day) to help resolve the issue even when i showed them the confirmation and the proper dates. not a place i would go back to.
50,This typically large hotel gives a more 'boutique' vibe while providing the MGM experience and benefits. Very nicely decorated. Great dining options. Awesome and helpful staff. Eataly is exciting. An updated classic with understated sophistication.
10,When I initially walked into my room I noticed that it was very outdated and dark. The room was relatively clean but I didn't dare sit on the couch that look like it had been there since the 80's. The first night I opened the ironing board and the person in the room next to me started knocking on the door that divided our rooms for me to be quiet it was 8:30pm. I was kind of annoyed at first but thought I would try and be more quiet incase he wakes up early. He did wake up early around 4 am I hear him talking on the phone. He wasn't talking loud at all the issue was how thin the walls were. I got through the first night but the second night/ morning when I heard him on the phone at 4 am and after about an hour and a half of trying to get back to sleep I decided to switch rooms. I was told that I was lucky they had one available that I could move too and it was made out to be more of a hassle. Just a heads up if you're hoping to get a good nights sleep you may want to upgrade to a more expensive room that will be a bit quieter but honestly I don't feel the cost represents the room you get here.
10,Injured myself due to a sharp tub stopper needing replacing. Had to get a tetanus shot just in case... Rooms need to be overhauled or just in need of maintenance check. Overall just glad to have checked out in one piece.
50,Park MGM is great. The entire place is smoke free. The staff is always very attentive and friendly. The dining choices are awesome. Eataly is a must... never enough time to stay and enjoy all that Eataly has to offer in regards to eating and drinking Can't wait to come back.
50,Great dining and entertainment options (Eatily for sure!) Location is perfect as well especially if attending an event at TMobile arena. Room wasn't huge but very comfortable and well designed. Definitely hit Mama Rabbit if you like Tequila...
50,I stayed for a conference and was very pleased with the room and the staff. It was the perfect location to enjoy the Las Vegas strip. Bavette's and Primrose were amazing restaurants right there in the hotel.
40,Had a great time great view room was nice and clean. Staff was nice and helpful. In a great location so much around. Overall a nice hotel! I would most definitely book a room there again! It is worth it!
50,Was a joyful experience. Would recommend to a friemd to say there. I will be rerutning to Vegas in a few months. Will be looking into staying here again. Friendly and very approachable and friendly. Don't get to have that alot.
20,There is no coffee in room. Worse it was a 20+ wait both mornings at the Starbucks in the lobby. It should not take 30 minutes and necessitate leaving your room for coffee at a $250/night hotel room.    Bed sheets were also very rough. Below 3 star hotel standard
40,We really enjoyed our time at Park MGM. The rooms online were a little nicer than the ones we actually stayed in but we didn’t mind. We loved how close we were to everything we wanted to do. There was also a shuttle pick up right outside the hotel.
50,This is my new go to. I will be staying here for all my future trips to Vegas. Ate at Primrose the noddle bar and the sports bar. Had great service and great food at all 3. The no smoking is truly no smoking. I thought it would cut down on the smoking but figured there would be some rule breakers. I saw none my entire trip.
50,We got a great deal from M Life Rewards - so we planned a family vacation around it. We were so happy with the location world class service and amenities (swimming pool restaurants/bars etc.). We will stay there again!
40,Conveniently located to T-Mobile Arena and Dolby Live is located in the hotel. Strip view is great. Uber/Lyft Fees are fairly reasonable to almost anywhere. Bedding was not the best. The bed was somewhat uncomfortable and sits extremely low to the ground.
50,So nice and the Silk Sonic show was so great…The staff was great. The shower could of use some help. The steak house was one of the best meals we have had in along time. We ate at the bar and the service was great.
40,Rooms feel dated they push to use app for check in and digital keys but it never works for me other guests said the same. Makes it difficult to use elevators. Upgrade to app needs to happen ASAP! If not go back to standard check in but you need more staff for that.
10,This place is just a giant motel with a casino. There’s no coffee maker or refrigerator in the rooms. You can’t order iced coffee from room service (it’s literally just ice in coffee) and they have a 6 cup minimum for regular coffee. Currently waiting in line for 30 min at Starbucks just for single cup of coffee. The bed is lumpy and the pillows are hard as rocks. Room was dirty when I checked in and the walls are so thin you can hear full conversations in the room next to you. Avoid this place at all costs.
50,I really enjoyed my stay here. I had a problem at check in but the staff immediately handled the situation. If you’re thinking about booking a room. I would highly suggest you do. Please be mindful they will place a hold on your account but will remove Upson checkout.
40,Great place to stay. Really valued the non-smoking aspect of the casino. Casino was clean and assistance was available when needed. Good crowd but plenty of slot machines to play. Hotel staff was friendly and food at the sports bar made for a perfect lunch.
50,Located in a great section of the strip. Rooms are spacious and nicely furnished. The housekeeping staff were very nice and kept the rooms very clean. Eataly has great food options. I will definitely stay at the Park MGM again.
30,Room was not as clean as we were expecting. Mold on edges of shower thick dust in crevice of window sill. Room was as clean as room in Excalibur we could’ve stayed there for less. But the staff was all fabulous.
50,Smoke free!!! And that’s it! Best hotel on the strip!! Eataly was great. I don’t gamble so I went on some great day trips. Many upgrades since I was here prior to 2020 and COVID. Will definitely stay here again!
40,Best part is that its non-smoking! I could clearly feel (and taste and smell) the difference between this property and all the others. There are also really great restaurants on property and venues for different activities too. Close in proximity to a lot of other things to do as well!
50,Great location for the hockey games! Clean comfortable rooms and excellent service. Non-smoking casino makes walking around enjoyable. Employees were friendly and quick to help. Check in was a breeze with the app. Will definitely stay here again.
40,On the whole was not bad. Loved the non smoking in the hotel. The staff was all great. But the floors being wet was concern. Also being not coffee maker or refrigerator in the room wasn't ideal. Also not enough barrel in the room and they don't put in a garbage bag.
10,Leo should not be working in hospitality. Please stay away from this property. Remember your comps will not work at Crack Shack. The staff are a joke. If you have to stay at MGM stay away from Park MGM. Not worth your time.
30,just had different paint in rooms. nothing new. good location on the strip. close to everything. target across the street. food is expensive as it is on the strip. i recommend going off strip. service was slow.
30,"The whole reservation process seemed to want to be tailored to be App based and ""streamlined"" but lacked once you tired to interact in person. Any assistance needed or wanted seemed to be dismissed as ""oh well you did it online""."
50,Park MGM is smoke free! It’s nice to go back to the hotel after being in smoking areas throughout Vegas. The casino level is nice and there is a good variety of dining options. I will stay here again in the future.
40,Park MGM Las Vegas is an extremely convenient location if you are attending a concert at Dolby or the Tmobile Arena. The staff was wonderful. The casino is smoke-free and we LOVED that. The dining options made it convenient to grab an exquisite meal and then head to a show. There are designated areas for Uber and Lyft pickup which was great. The only downside is that we could not sleep. There is no much noise outside of the hotel 24/7 that sleeping was impossible. There was music playing all night long. I had to buy expensive earplugs in the convenience store located in the lobby. That is the only issue that would deter me from staying again.
50,Great place to stay for hockey game. Eat at Best Friend it’s amazing! The casino is clean. Smoke free. It’s connected to the Aria. Right by TMobile Arena. Also the tram takes you to Bellagio. Great for a hockey trip.
30,My husband is handicapped so we are always looking for convenience when traveling. This location had motorized (scooters) wheelchairs for about $50 a night. They have weekly rates as well. The wheelchair was in good condition and conveniently located at the Bell Desk.    The design upon entry needs work. The checkin desk is not easy to find. It is not marked and is located in the middle of the lobby. Why???! The first desk you see when walking in is the Bell Desk. Then you see the VIP checkin before you see the common folk checkin. That’s just weird.    Our room was a little small but it was up to date. The towels were very rough and dingy and our sheet covers were torn. But it was a good place to stay overall because of the restaurants and shopping near by.
50,I thought the service from hotel staff was excellent. I enjoyed the smoke free environment. The hotel location was perfect. There is a lot to see and experience within walking distance. The gym was great! The room was very comfortable.
20,Never ever again room was very small you could hear everything someone said in the next room so we were woken up a lot terrible smell of pot very excessive not enough draw space no coffee maker or refrigerator!!!
50,Stayed here to see Metallica at the stadium. Plenty of things to do and was walking distance to the show. Rooms were clean and ready to go when we got there. Mobile Check in is the best thing ever invented. Got to park and walk right up to our room using our phone as a key.
50,Great stay at Park MGM. We stayed 5 nights in a Nightingale suite. The room was right off the elevator to the right. 24th floor room 202. Its about 700 square foot. Beds were comfortable and even the couch pulled out into a bed. We had a strip view. Also the room came with a refrigerator which was nice. Shower and bathroom were nice as well. The room is very spacious. We plan on staying again in one of these rooms in the near future.
30,Great room and restaurants. But boy does it get crowded!! Mornings are a zoo! Lines for coffee a mile long. Need coffee makers in rooms OR more coffee/breakfast options. Great location but it can get noisy at night.
50,Highly recommend this resort. Not too big and not too small with all of the amenities. The Dolby Live theater is awesome and Primrose has the best breakfast on the strip. Excellent experience every time we stay here.
50,I went to the spa this morning for a nice relaxing day. I was absolutely amazed by the care and treatment I received from my esthetician Kathy. The facial I received from her was impeccable she was professional gentle soothing and very personable. Hands down the best spa treatment I have ever received at any of the MGM resorts!!! If your on the strip and need to relax the park spa is highly recommend. Kathy is definitely the therapist you should make reservations with I promise you won’t regret it!!!!    Thank you Kathy for making my vacation so much better    Kyle
30,Was not impressed by the room i was put in while staying at the Park MGM. Especially for the price i paid. Probably would not stay again at this hotel. The building was in a nice location easily accessible to the strip.
50,My 2nd time of staying at the Park MGM and it’s even better than I was there the last time I stayed. I highly recommend it! Excellent service and lots of accommodations! Can’t wait to go back! Love Vegas!
50,The Park MGM is my favorite hotel/casino on the Strip. First it's location is perfect center Strip allowing you to walk north or south and easily reach your other favorite places. The Park MGM is newly remodeled with the rooms featuring newer amenities and large walk-in showers. The beds are comfortable unlike other Vegas hotels. The casino is busy but not overwhelming. Restaurants are excellent and the staff are all friendly and helpful throughout the property.
50,Room spotless well appointment very good customer service. Great place for wedding party to stay. Liked key only gets you to your own floor. Very polite and helpful staff. Overall it was a great stay .
50,Stayed here a few times and never had a problem. They have a great breakfast place and a nice variety for food for lunches and dinner. The pools were nice and the casino itself is smoke free which I enjoy. The location is nice too. My only complaint is they don't have a 24 hour food place which I usually just go next door to new york new york for late night food. Definitely would recommend staying at the Park Mgm.
50,I go to Vegas every year for a work meeting and usually stay at the MGM Grand. They are both great but I definitely prefer the Park MGM. The Park MGM is much smaller and I love the Eataly restaurant. it feels like you're walking the food markets in Italy. It's a bit pricy but what isn't now in Vegas. I really hope to stay there again next year.
50,Finally a smoke free casino in Vegas.  Rooms are very nice and clean. Pool area is very nice. Tree pools to choose from.  Great restaurants and entertainment. Definitely need to visit Eatily. Italian food and drinks all in one place.
50,1st time to Las Vegas. Park MGM was very clean non smoking and the entire staff was exceptional. Great location on the strip. Eatery had several food choices that made it easy every day . We will definitely choose the Park MGM again.
40,the hotel was clean and the staff were friendly I would recommend this resort to anyone looking for a place that is on the strip and at a fair price. I will be back sometime soon. I enjoyed the fact that there was a star bucks down stairs
40,Throughly enjoyed our stay at this hotel. The place is centrally located and it is non smoking establishment. Even the casino area is non-smoking which is a plus for us. They have a nice food court with an italian theme.
50,Our overall experience was excellent. Check-in was effortless with online check-in hotel and casino staff are friendly and helpful and at times quite humorous as well. The food is good and ample selection for all.
50,One of the best hotels on the strip! Great amenties. Great rooms. Great restaurants. Great access to the south side of the strip. Staff is always friendly and helpful. Great renovations from the old Monte Carlo. Always love to stay here!
50,The entire property was clean staff was friendly Best Friends was delicious and unique. We also took a visit to the spa which was divine! The entire property is smoke free and that makes such a difference! We would come back again!
40,Great hotel and casino. I found the food court not so easy to follow and understand exactly what is offered. Very confusing. Wish there were different options to choose from. Great hotel rooms and views. Employee's very nice and casino fun!
50,Room was clean and good. Used the App for checking in and out was excellent. Kiosks to get a physical key was very practical. I love the location of Park MGM as its close to other excellent Casinos.    I can't wait to book my next trip with M Life
50,Great location smoke free environment. Several locations to eat on site and next door. Ots of attractions close as well. Easy check in and check out using MGM rewards app. Clean updated rooms even the comped rooms.
30,I recently made Gold Member status. While I was able to waive the resort fees I wasn’t able to upgrade my room. It was a Sunday in February and the hotel didn’t seem packed. My room had a tub and sink that drained very slowly.maintenance took care of it right away but it just added to the frustration.
50,Great location and has some awesome food selections like eataly a noodle house roy chois best friend (yum!) and starbucks for the morning right outside the guest elevators. Casino is smoke free so its easier to breathe. Casino is a bit spread out but its nice thats it cozy.
50,Amazing environment and it was a great location. I enjoyed the fact that it was a smoke free environment. Next time I would like to upgrade to stay well room. The eataly restaurants were beyond fantastic!
40,Very convenient location and having a smoke free casino hotel in Vegas was a very nice experience. Getting in and out of the self park garage is a bit cumbersome especially on Fri/Sat night but it wasn't so bad I would avoid staying here. If you are attending an event at Dolby Live or T-Mobile it is perfect. Eatily and Best Friend we great get the Medjool Date Cake at Best Friend it is incredible.
40,We would definately go back to the Park MGM Las Vegas. Our sleep quality was only poor because there was a very loud fire alarm at midnight one night. Other than that the beds are okay. If you have a party-er next door you will hear the noise though. Staff is very friendly. Room Service was fast and tasty but served on take out container - kind of ruins the experience. The location is at the end of the strip so you have to walk far to get to the other hotels.
40,Great location on the strip. Expensive room for what it was. Room is as clean and beds were comfortable! Really thin walls! No upgrades for gold members even though I received an email. Strong smell of weed in many areas.
40,Clean hotel good customer service located on the south end of the Strip convenient to other hotels and shops several good places to eat on the property. One of the only smoke free casinos in Vegas!
50,very friendly staff to include people working parking garage. Smoke free casino is a big plus. Nice selection of restaurants on the property. The Primrose had an excellent breakfast. Would recommend this property over any on the strip.
40,The Park is a great totally non smoking casino and hotel. Great location right close to T-Mobile Arena too. The eatery is awesome with a nice buy what you like concept. The Park also has an easy online checkin avoiding all the long lines.
50,Our 1st time at this hotel and it was a great experience. A smoke free hotel friendly service lots of slot machines to choose from and and an overall great time period centrally located located made it convenient to all other casinos in the area.
50,Celebrating our 16th Anniversary. We got married here in Las Vegas and we are still together. We come back every year. Best place to celebrate. We love the wine bar in the front. We got our Grove back with Soul Sonic!
40,Stayed here for 3 nights (Fri-Mon) in February with my sister. Enjoyed our stay. Check-in front desk and bell service were great. The gentleman working the cab line on Sat and Mon night was AMAZING!  We ate in Eataly - it's a bit too crazy for me on the weekends very crowded.  Thought we could maybe sit by the pool mid-day but the pool at was open was in the shade mostly.
50,It located in the middle of strip.the room could have been cleaner but I always wipe and spray everything my self. It’s really quiet.I like that a non smoking casino. Its not to big like the grand MGM thank god.easy to get through the hotel
40,"Comparing it to the previous Monte Carlo I liked the MC better. Park MGM is fine but it is not as fun. Small sports book. Rectangle pools. Crowded Eataly that you had to dodge and weave through to exit out to the strip. Still a solid property that I would stay at if the price was right.    Also the rooms are a bit updated but don't feel ""new"". Standard rooms are pretty small and have no fridge or coffee.    Shower water pressure was the best feature. (Amazing how a desert town doesn't use water conserving shower heads.)"
40,While the rooms and casino leave a bit to be desired the non smoking aspect makes up for it in spades (pun intended). I’d give it a higher rating if I preferred vintage rooms and furniture over marble and “swank”.
50,The nightingale suite was wonderful and priced right. Staff was friendly helpful and our room was super clean. We will be back!! Close to excellent shopping. Parking was easy. I’d say it was an awesome good time.
40,If you are a non smoker this is your casino!! It is so nice not to have to smell cigarettes the entire time you are gambling. Rooms are fine. Beds are comfortable. Bathrooms have been updated. Great location between New York New York and Aria. There is a free tram that will take you to Bellagio behind the hotel. Only downside is the rooms and hallways are not as fancy as some of the other hotels. Just a little dated.
20,For the price you can stay in much nicer rooms. Stayed in a king room facing the valet area and they had music blasting 24/7. Had to use headphones to sleep. Not a fan of the bathroom. They use a slider door and have no fan in toilet area. Not great for couples or families. Was not greeted when we arrived and had to use self check in which took a long time even with a reservation code. Casino and restaurants are great here but stay elsewhere.
50,I love Park MGM because it is non-smoking and beautiful. The restaurants are great and in a type of food court area so eating is a breeze and very good. We think Eataly is just the best. And after dinner there is gelato or pastry or whatever you want. The rooms are comfortable and the bedding is too. It is quite convenient to the strip without walking everywhere in the heat.
50,Located on the strip near all arena's. Newer hotel with out being too expensive. Rooms and Casino are clean staff is friendly. Lots of dining options in or near hotel. Walking distance to most of the arenas and strip.
50,This was our second stay at the Park MGM and we really enjoyed it. First off the location center strip cant be beat. Fantastic food options...Eataly Bavettes Steak House and Best Friend to name a few. Housekeeping was excellent clean comfortable room and we scored a great rate on MLife which was the icing on the cake. The hotel and casino is non-smoking which was a nice change. All in all a wonderful stay...and we're going back in April to see Lady Gaga.
50,I booked a room here because of Silk Sonic’s opening weekend and Park MGM is attached to the Dolby Live where they performed. We didn’t have to walk far or take transportation. It was a simple walk downstairs from our room. The room service and breakfast was great too. Overall a great experience.
50,I was in Vegas for a conference. It was located in the hotel. Staff were very friendly. I took advantage of the gym and the restaurants located in the hotel. I really recommend this hotel. Very easy accessible to the tram to other hotels.
50,Love Park MGM very clean and the rooms and facility is smoke free. Gaming is great and the location is fantastic. Close enough to Allegiant Stadium to walk but tram just one casino away. Close to T Mobile Arena. Great part of strip for food and drink and shows. We will be back.
30,The place needs more variety of place to eat. Have a separate room if you want to smoke.Parking should be complimentary if you stay in Park MGM. Also they should bring back shuttling people from airport to hotel.
30,CONS: You can hear everything going on outside your door the connecting rooms door and inside your neighbors rooms. The hotel is small overall (compared to the mLife casinos) which means limited food casino area is small and no lobby bar with machines (think ‘MGM grand’).    PRO: only non smoking casino on the strip. The food options they have are phenomenal (Eataly and Primrose were SO good). Close walk to aria cosmo MGM Grand and NYNY.
50,The Dolby Live Theater is SUPERB! The NoMad rooms are classy sexy relaxing. Came to see Bruno and Anderson Paak (Silk Sonic Concert)... any spot in the Theater is like front row seats. The Dolby sound --out of this world!
50,First time I've been to the Park MGM since it was remodeled and it was an excellent experience. The room was clean and new additions like Eataly and Crack chicken made the stay great. Excellent location to other south Strip locations.
50,The hotel is clean. Rooms are unique. The feel takes you back in time. The couch is a velvet gem colored green I LOVED it. The casino is quiet and smoke free. The entire hotel and casino has a calmer vibe than others on the strip. EATILY was amazing desserts are delicious.
50,Central to everything Eataly was delicious! I even won some money!!! All in all the hotel was my absolute favorite I’ve ever stayed at in all the years I’ve been coming to Las Vegas. Whenever I come to Vegas this is my first choice!
50,This hotel is an amazing deal at the price point offered. Beautiful place with a great staff and location. I would stay there again in a heart beat. The only negative would be the loud speakers outside all night. Don't turn them OFF. Just turn them DOWN between 10pm and 10am. That would be my only critique and feedback. Thanks again.
50,The concierge was very helpful and super friendly. The check-in was super easy and took no time at all. The hotel was beautiful and felt like a very safe place to be. It's a great location and made the trip that much better!
50,Last minute trip to Vegas with my husband. Haven't been to visit for a few years so wasn't sure where to stay. Non-smoking hotel was what caught my eye first. Staff very friendly room clean and quiet food at hotel excellent. Walkable to anything you want to do. Will definitely stay here again!
50,Loved the stay at Park MGM. Would like to visit again the check-in and check out process with the MGM app was the best. Aside from few times it took a while to load the key due to connectivity issues had no issues at all. We got of the cab and straight into our room and on our way out straight into the cab with easy check out process.
20,I was really disappointed with the Park MGM room quality. The first room we had faced the arena and the freeway and even though we were on the 16th floor the street noise sounded like it was right outside our window. The room arrangement was bizarre - the bed faces the window and the TV is off to one side so you have to pull it out and swing the arm around and still look to the side to watch TV. The outside noise was so bad on a Thursday at 10pm that we asked to switch to another room. The request was accommodated which was nice but the next room was possibly even worse. It didn’t face the arena but there were people In the next room with an adjoining door that were talking all night and I could hear every word of their convo like they were talking right in my ear. I could maybe have put that aside if not for the fact that someone started power drilling in the hallway outside our room at 7:30am the next morning. Like how can that not wait until at least 9am? Or maybe happen on a Wednesday afternoon or something? When I called to ask to move the staff member said he would “investigate” and didn’t offer a different room. It was extremely disappointing. After explaining that investigating was not sufficient I finally gave up and asked to be connected to the Nomad hotel to see if we could switch there. It’s in the same building but the top floors. The staff member who offered to investigate the power drilling didn’t manage to successfully transfer me to the nomad desk so I had to call back again and I luckily got a different person who did transfer me. I was not immediately offered a room but after some back and forth they “found” one that I could pay $100/night extra to upgrade to. I’m disappointed that I had to pay so much to upgrade to a merely satisfactory room but at least the nomad wasn’t plagued with the noise and hospitality issues of the Park MGM. I am also glad that for $370/night the nomad at least offered complimentary q tips and cotton balls in the bath ok  which were not available at the Park MGM. The Park MGM bathrooms also didn’t have towel hooks for the hand towels so I guess you’re just supposed to leave them right on the sink?? I don’t know what’s going on with this place but for being one of the most recently renovated hotels in Vegas it’s a hot mess. Don’t waste your money or time at Park MGM.
10,We have stayed at numerous MGM properties and thought this one would be a good fit because it is smoke free. While it may be smoke free the rooms are also free of some rather standard every day items anyone would expect to have in a hotel room. There are no refrigerators or coffee makers in the room. As senior adults we depend on having a refrigerator for medication and a coffee maker for coffee or tea at our leisure.  The casino area is lacking a reasonable amount of restrooms for the amount of people that go through. It is very difficult to find a restroom leaving you to have to walk a great distance.  The dining options at this hotel are mediocre at best.  If you plan to have a great Vegas vacation you have to go outside of Park MGM.
50,I looked at numerous hotels and read a lot of reviews before booking a room at Park MGM. We were very impressed with the rooms staff location and everything they had to offer. I would highly recommend this place!
40,This is the place to go if you are going to ANY EVENT at T-Mobile Arena. Its literally a stones throw away. The pool is alright though if you are going for a tan you need to be prepared to move your chair around a bit because of the blockage of the buildings on the light. EATALY is excellent on site. The resort fee for anyone who does NOT have a car and in the winter months is a joke because you are not really doing anything that would constitute why you are actually paying it. Lastly STARBUCKS in the hotel is EXORBITANTLY expensive. Literally you should at least go to EATALY and get a hand crafted Italian drink for the prices that STARBUCKS charges you for an inferior product. Sports book doesn't always print the sheets you would normally read to make your bets like the other sports books in the city. Sort of lame if I am honest. Nice music club on-site that if you don't want to go off property its good for a night.
50,Close to everything Nonsmoking clean would definitely go there again! They had a tram to go to Bellagio. Taxi service right in front. Room service was a plus too! Silk Sonic is what draw us. Hope to come back again soon.
10,Don’t book a room facing the t-mobile arena. They play loud music until 1am (or even later some nights) that you can hear from your room. This music goes on well past any event or concert has ended. I was on the 14th floor and you can hear it in your room. Also the bedsheets feel like sandpaper very low quality. I was in town for a conference and this was the hotel where we got the group rate - very unfortunate.
50,We loved that it was completely smoke free. Loved the restaurants and the Italy area. The beds were extremely comfortable.  I am are going back in May with my husband and will stay at the Park MGM again.
30,I love that fact that the hotel is smoke free. The restaurants are very good. The rooms are not very good. the beds are to low to the ground and it seems that they need a little maintenance. Overall it's a great hotel just may stay somewhere else.
30,We were disappointed in the lack of usual amenities like a microwave coffee maker and especially a refrigerator. Walls we're to thin allowing us to hear our noisy neighbors. Bed was comfortable room was clean shower door leaked.
50,The hotel was great. Having silk sonic there performing was great because they made the trip a 11 out of 10. I was really a beautiful show. The restaurants were great! I had a top quality steak I forgot the name of the place but it was perfect!
40,Convenient location and friendly staff. Decent amenities and good cleanliness throughout. Overall very good experience although guests should be made aware that rooms that face the T-Mobile arena experience constant sounds from the speakers at all times. It's especially harder to sleep when there are public events like the Las Vegas Golden Knights hockey game concerts or UFC fights.
40,This hotel was one of the smaller ones we stayed at in Vegas. We came for a Girls Volleyball Tournament. I really enjoyed this smaller hotel and smoke free was a bonus. I enjoy gambling and walking around in the hotels but not with 2nd hand smoke this was awesome!
50,Central location and easy walk to other locations and stores on the strip. Everyone is super on the staff and very friendly. Highly recommend! Perks are nice too. I love the view from the top floors of the strip as well.
40,I really like Park MGM based on it's location size and amount of other guests in the lobby and halls. I had a problem this past visit due to very loud neighbors and a lack of hot water. I will return but I hope I don't have these same problems.
50,Came with a friend for 2 complimentary nights with MyVegas rewards did the mobile check in and check out was very fast and easy. But now I know when doing the mobile check in you will get the worst view available. The room had a modern look nice bathroom. The only problem i had was the blankets and towels were dirty we didn't mind it because we brought our own. Staff was VERY helpful and friendly.
50,My group and I had a lovely time at the Park MGM. The hotel is well kept and everyone was very friendly! They were Blessed to accommodate and rooms request and got everyone in our party on the same floor! The rooms are spacious and clean! There aren't a ton of dining options but Eataly was absolutely amazing! And just across the street there are so many dining options at New York New York. My absolute 100 percent favorite part of this hotel was that it is entirely smoke free. There is a free tram that is easy to get that goes between the Park MGM and the Bellagio a huge plus! Im not much of a gambler so I can't speak on that experience but there seems to be you standard options. Overall great hotel!
50,If you are finally looking for that smoke free casino hotel experience here it is. Very friendly and accommodating staff. Food choices were excellent. The price was great and it really truly is in a great location.
50,Park MGM is a very nice hotel. Everyone was friendly and eager to help. The room was clean and bed was comfortable. I especially loved it was a non-smoking hotel. It is low-key hotel and away from all the hustle and bustle of the strip.
50,Clean and comfortable rooms. Super friendly and attentive staff - especially the room technician Sylvestre. Everything you would ever need is within the property. If you happen to want something that isn’t within it’s definitely accessible or the staff will make it accessible for you.
50,Literally a breath of fresh air on the strip the only non smoking casino on the strip. I didn't stay here so can't comment on the rooms. We were shocked to find out casinos still allowed smoking we stayed at the luxor which claimed to have some sort of clean air system - not! We visited Park mgm on several occasions and also the Eately with good choice of food and the staff were amazing. Hopefully other casinos follow their smoke free example I would stay here if I come back to vegas.
20,Paper thin walls could here everything. There was music every night- so loud could not sleep. The room next to us had pot smoking which filled our room every day. It’s supposed to be non smoking hotel. Was charged for a charger and a water that fell over when checking out of room. Could not be resolved upon checkout. Will ge staying at another hotel next time.
40,We stayed here on a comp offer and everything was great! We even got $250 resort credit that we used for room service and $375 FREE play! It was an offer that was hard to turn down and we are extremely pleased with the hotel rooms and the offered amenities. Will definitely be visiting this property again soon.
30,Not a bad basic hotel but will stay else where next time. The floor I was on the music from outside was so loud it would keep me up. No refrigerator in the room which meant more money spent getting cold drinks.
40,Eataly is a great place for morning coffee and breakfast.NY NY is located across the street also a short walk indoors to the Aria. Plenty of options for food. Pools look nice but didn't get to try them out this time around.
50,A hotel and casino that are 100% smoke free beyond fantastic. All of the staff was professional and friendly and very helpful. location was perfect for what we had planned and I would easily stay there again.
20,we had a problem with check in room and parking garage...average at best. customer service was ok but when we spoke to hotel manager the issues were going to be fixed but unfortunately they were not resolved. this is the 2nd time we had issues at this hotel it won't happen again...
50,We stayed four nights. The hotel has a lot of places to eat and there are a lot of places nearby. The hotel is smoke free! And there is a tram that runs between park MGM and the Bellagio. The property is clean and fresh smelling when you walk in. We had connecting rooms and they were both nice and clean. Try the Hard Rock for breakfast. We ate there twice and the food and service was great.
50,There I said it. The entire property is smoke free and it’s located centrally along the strip. We recently went there over the long weekend with the entire family and had a blast.  The hotel was well renovated from what used to be the Monte Carlo and the rooms were spacious and very clean.  Their location is between NyNY and Aria and you have very close walking distance to everything on the strip. There’s also a huge CVS beside the resort to get snacks drinks alcohol and other Knick knacks.    Hotel and hotel rooms: 5/5  Very spacious and clean. Check in and checkout is very simple as long as you use the digital key.    Pool: 5/5  Open from 10am-4pm. Very easily accessible from the main lobby and guest elevators. They have a nice sized hot tub and also provide towels for your convenience.  Not the biggest pool but it’s cozy enough to relax and enjoy Vegas weather.    Gaming: 5/5  Their gaming floor has many slots and table games. Slots are fairly loose and they do carry the newest and latest games.  I wish that they would have more table games available but it’s okay for a small casino. It’s smoke free so I’m not complaining.    Restaurants: 3/5  To be quite honest we didn’t enjoy the restaurant options that this resort carried. Eately was okay but nothing special. The Eately pavilion only has Italian food options and you kind of expected more for the price. No buffets! Bummer.  But then again you’re very close to the buffets at Cosmopolitan Bellagio Excalibur and Luxor.  My favorite buffet that’s at an MGM property would still be the Buffet at Bellagio. Once the take over of Cosmopolitan is complete by MGM Wickedspoons would be my top choice.    Parking: 4/5  The parking lot is easily accessible from the strip and finding parking can be a task when it’s busy. But that’s common for Vegas. To get free parking just sign up for their MGM rewards card and it’s just that simple. From the parking lot to the hotel lobby and guest elevators only takes 5 minutes to walk to.    Staff: 5/5  Park MGM staff are very nice. I hope they keep it up.    Overall: 4.5/5  This is by far the most comfortable place that my family and I enjoyed staying at Las Vegas. Its in a perfect location and smoke free.
50,We’ve stayed at this resort ever since it opened in 1996 and will continue to stay there! You don’t have to go through the casino to get to the elevators to the rooms is a big plus. Casino is laid out nice and staff is great.
50,Great location! I loved being in such close vicinity to all things we needed and super cool being next to the arena. The clean and updated rooms had a great Vegas vibe and the amenities in the hotel were awesome. We loved Eataly! I would say the negative was the huge line at Starbucks in the mornings:)_
50,Had a great stay will be back looking forward to our next trip. the weather was great the staff was great could not ask for more. Went to see the Rat Pack is Back fantastic show RECOMMENT IT GO SEE IT.
50,We loved the smoke-free atmosphere. We really enjoyed the Primrose restaurant. The food was excellent. We enjoyed hanging out in Eataly. Thank you so much for the offers you send to us. We enjoy the MGM rewards program.
50,Brief trip to Vegas for a Super Bowl event. Wished we stayed longer! I enjoyed utilizing the app to check in with the key on my phone. However truth be told we ended up also getting a card key because if the wifi connection wasn't good (which happened at times throughout the hotel) it was a pain to pull up the key ont he phone.  Loved the room! The decor and view were stunning! Bed was very comfortable. Very clean as well! Staff was friendly too. Definitely recommend!
50,I haven't been on a vacation in a long time. This vacation was long over due and I had a great experience at the hotel. My room was nice and clean. The room was a great price. Its located right on the strip with access to other hotels and other attractions.
50,Best Hotel stay for us so far. Everything was convenient from mobile check in to mobile check out. Our room was ready very early once we checked in on the app. There was ample parking and our room was located close to elevator. I live that this is a no-smoking hotel. I didn’t have to smell the stinky cigarettes like other hotels.
50,I love be there I play and win and I drink walk in all Vegas I love Vegas because my kid and family get fun all the time I hope next time is going to be better . I love to eat in the buffet and end going the night
50,I enjoyed the room at Park mgm. I appreciated the style and decor of the hotel. Everything was very clean and stylish. I liked how quiet everything was. Very good value and nice stay. Highly recommend.
10,- Mold in the bathroom.  - Crumbs and stains on the carpet in my room.  - Incidentals hold was $400!!!  - No mini fridge.  - No response from management.  - Wasn’t allowed to speak with management.  - Zero replies from emails.
50,Perfect location on the Strip if you’re going to T-Mobile Arena or Allegiant Stadium. Newest MGM property in Vegas too. Might need to make this the new spot vs. MGM Grand! Already booked my next trip after this stay!
40,Good value and great location right next to T-Mobile arena and New York New York. Very convenient to have Eataly on the way into the casino. The rooms are basic but clean and well equipped. Very friendly staff.
50,I would highly recommend this casino to Non Smokers who want to have a great time! We celebrated our 35th wedding anniversary here and had an awesome time. We loved the gaming experience and the restaurants! The beds were so comfortable and staff were very friendly and helpful.
50,This place is packed full of great restaurants. The staff was amazing and real nice. Not to huge and just right to navigate around. Has a free tram to the neighboring casinos close by. Rooms were clean comfortable and access in and out was seamless. I'd definitely stay there again.
50,My spouse and I stayed at the park hotel casino and loved it better than the Bellagio and mirage because it’s non smoking. We stayed one week in a handicapped room and loved the room service for breakfast and lunch. We had a super view on the Streep. We will be back soon when we get back to LV .
50,After reading some of the reviews I was a little nervous to stay here but I had a really enjoyable stay. I loved that the casino was non-smoking. It sure makes a big difference! The bars and restaurants within the facility were also great. I love Eataly and visit every time I’m in NYC or Chicago and this one is much smaller in size but the quality of the food is great. By Las Vegas standards a standard room here is fairly small but still plenty of room. Anyone complaining about the size should try staying in a hotel in NYC and she how they feel then. Those rooms are true shoeboxes. I also read a lot of complaints about storage. There was a small set of drawers in our closet which was fine for a three night stay for two people but there is definitely space in the room for a full dresser or another set of drawers. I can also understand the noise factor from the hallways but fortunately my sound machines drowned out the noise and I don’t think the rooms on either side of us were occupied. We also stayed during the week which probably helps. The pressure in the shower was great and the room was kept really clean. We stayed on the 24th floor in a strip view suite and paid extra for the food and beverage package. Keep in mind the the credit is per day and is not cumulative over your stay. I didn’t know that so I didn’t get all of my money’s worth.
50,Staff service was some of the best I have had while ever being in Vegas. We stayed in a nighthawk suite. The suite size was perfect for us. The smokeless casino made a huge difference in our gaming experience. The Eataly is wonderful; overall ParkMGM had some of the better food options close by compared to some of the other Vegas properties where we have stayed. This will be our come to place in Vegas!
10,The music that plays outside the hotel in the t Mobil patio area plays 24/7. The walls and windows of the hotel aren’t ick enough to cancel the noise. You’d better be a heavy sleeper or no sleep 4 you
50,I really enjoyed my stay everything was above and beyond I will definitely be back for a longer stay. I loved gambling and they have a huge Starbucks which is my favorite coffee spot. The shops inside are nice
20,Don't get rooms facing the arena! Extremely loud especially the lower floors. Rooms are dated. I wish check-in staff was better trained to ask travelers if this would be acceptable before assigning rooms.
50,We had a very pleasant experience and stay at this smaller hotel. Loved the fact it was completely smoke free! We were here for a volleyball tourney and pleasantly surprised at the quality and central location.
50,We're there for a short trip. The hotel was stunning without the lingering smoke smell. It was a fun place to explore and the Eataly has some amazing Italian cuisine. Withing walking distance to Aria Cosmopolitan and Bellagio. If you are feeling tired from all the walking there's a tram connecting all those hotels.
40,Park MGM was in a great location with a convenient tram to the Bellagio. The restaurants at both Park MGM and the connected Aria were great and offered a lot of variety especially enjoyed Eataly at Park MGM and Julian Serrano Tapas at Aria. Especially love that the casion/hotel is smoke free. Loved the fragrance we smelled everytime we walked in. My only complaint is that there are no mini-refrigerators and microwaves in the room. Such a shame to not have a basic amenity.
50,Everything was perfect; however the walls in the rooms are entirely way too thin. I could hear my neighbors pulling the blinds up and down and could hear people casually walking in the hallway. The staff were helpful and kind. I enjoyed my stay and appreciated the late checkout.
40,We only stayed one night to catch a Golden Knights game. Great location as the arena is right behind the hotel. Great food options as well as being really close to NYNY if you don't want to pay Park MGM prices. Resort fee was high just like everywhere else at $44.75. For that much I'd like to see parking included but parking was an extra $15. I know it's a little thing to complain about. Overall our stay was great. Second time staying here and we'd stay again.
50,We chose Park MGM for our anniversary on Valentine's day. We got a free room upgrade to the 23rd floor with lovely pool views. We love this hotel/casino because it is smoke-free Eataly is inside Park just a great location near the strip and all the action! Looking forward to coming back soon.
50,Nice ambiance and smoke free property is a plus. Proximity to the strip is excellent. The room was nice and clean every day for our three night stay. Would definitely recommend to anyone going to Las Vegas.
50,No smoking clothes did not smell of smoke after being in casino. Great food. Eataly fun to see all the Italian foods and drinks. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Next to T mobile arena. Sports book is a great place to hang and watch your team. Good snacks also.
50,Our 1st stay at Park MGM. We met Bobby Tomas from security. We had a dozen questions about things and he was able to direct us and help us find everything we needed. Very personable. He's a great asset to Park MGM.
50,This is a great place to stay and play! My only negative is that most of their restaurants all have the Italian theme so there is not a whole lot of variety (this does not detract from the overall experience however).
50,I enjoy playing slots at the Park MGM Resort because it’s a non smoking casino and all staff are friendly and courteous. The rooms are nice and very clean; and the beds are super comfortable. The location is perfect as it is next to the T-Mobile arena; and no hassle to find the entrance of the self parking garage.
10,Management Leo made the experience the worse stay and room is not as nice as the other locations. Pictures are deceiving. The bell person was also rude standing there not helping load the luggage onto the cart & expected big tip.
10,If you have any medical needs as simple as extra pillows or cover this is the wrong place to stay. I have to prop my legs up temporarily due to a medical condition I'm dealing with. I requested a medical refrigerator extra towels / wash cloths 4 extra pillows and an extra cover.. I only received the refrigerator and towels! Had to use my luggage in the bed to prop my legs up overnight. Had to use the extra towels as a substitute for the cover. I've never had such a poor experience in my many years of extensive travels.
20,I understand that the hotels aren’t the draw of being in Vegas. Ideally the hotel would be sufficient to sleep in after enjoying the strip/city. This was my first time staying at Park MGM (typically we stay at Mandalay Bay and Bellagio). Unfortunately it was a terrible experience and we will not be back. While the location was great the room was dirty upon our arrival with long black hairs all over the bathroom sink and shower. The sink in the bathroom also did not drain and after 14 seconds of the water running the water was stagnant and quite gross. We called the front desk on our first night and they said there was no one available to service the issues. They still were not addressed the following day.    The walls are also paper thin and we could hear the people in the next room at all times but this is a minor issue because we totally understand the hotel cannot control other people.
50,This place is magical! Only thing they could do to make it perfect for me is ad a little mor bouge to the rooms! Did not like the table and minimalist bedding. Did not fit with the vibe. Influencers…bring props!!! Over all if that was tweaked the place would be 10/10. Amazing service vibe and location!!
40,The hotel is nice but my room came with a few problems electrical near bed didn't work but maintenance fixed it. Makeup on wall in the bathroom sink has a permanent ring around it and coffee or pop splatters on wall near couch. Not to mention the view was not good at all I was staring at the roof and parking structure. Also it's a non smoking hotel but a Mexican cowboy was smoking in the Starbucks line security did stop him though.
40,The Hotel is very nice the rooms are good the location is great  Hope they will bring the service to a higher level and a better quality standards and that will keep people wanted to comeback and leave with a big smile
40,I used to love the Monte Carlo years ago so have always been hesitant to stay at Park MGM. I really loved everything about it even though 2 of the 3 nights were comped. The location is great and we had a great view of TMobile Arena and Allegiant Stadium in the distance not a bad view even if it wasn't a Strip view. The casino is non smoking which is really nice especially if you are going to spend any time gambling or drinking in the casino. Its proximity to New York New York and The Park is nice. The only complaint I have is that if you are using your digital key to enter and exit the parking garage it didn't work and we had to call security to get cleared through each time.
50,Nice hotel with lots of great food. Best part by far is everything is nonsmoking. Great for families and those that don’t smoke. Spacious rooms with view of the strip. Only complaint is bed was very firm even though advertised as pillow top.
30,First got the ram into issue at the front desk. Male was rude once asked why each of my rooms was an additional  $400 charge. When I spoke with Rep over the phone I was not made aware of a additional deposit apart from  What I had already paid. This is something that a guess should know before starting.
10,This hotel rooms were so outdated and the decor made absolutely no rhyme or reason as to why it was even there to begin with .The furnishings looked as though it was purchased from a garage sale and not even the same garage sale but numerous garage sales I felt as though I was in the haunted mansion at Disney Land .The only positive o could say is that the whole casino is smoke free . So I would maybe do some gambling there but never to stay as I might suffer nightmares once again
40,Lovely property and casino. Exceptional Bell desk staff as we had to leave our bags at both check in and check out. The open pool was shaded the entire time it was open which was a bummer. Maybe this was due to the time of year but it was a beautiful sunny day so it would have been nice to have sun at the pool.
50,It was a great time while I was there staff was very helpful and easy to work with. It was very comfy in the room was able to comfortably sleep in the room. The service was also great they came right away.
50,Entire hotel is SMOKE FREE!!! I like not smelling like cigarette by walking to my room. Enjoy the hotel proximity to venues other hotels. Staff is friendly. In room dining has limited options but ok and prompt service.
50,First time staying at the Park MGM and it did not disappoint. No smoking at all on the property is a very great thing. Everything was very well kept and clean. The staff from booking went above and beyond to accommodate our group last minute. As soon as we checked in they were consistently asking if there was anything we need or could do to make our trip better. I will be staying at this place again. Great rates on rooms and they are clean you can’t beat it!
50,So glad we ended up choosing this hotel. It was smaller that many of the others and easier to get around. We had a very nice comfortable room. We loved that the casino is non-smoking. We enjoyed exploring Eataly. The other food options were great too. The location of this hotel was perfect for exploring Vegas. We will definitely stay here again.
50,First time visiting the park mgm and was very happy with the staff and cleanliness of not only the buildings but also the rooms. Definitely looking forward to our next trip to Las Vegas and our stay at the Park MGM.
50,This was my 1st time booking a hotel in Vegas but I had tickets to see the VGK at the T-Mobile Arena and chose Park MGM because it’s literally just across the street. Plus it’s great not having to pay extra for a smoke-free room and only $15 per day to park at any MGM owned property (majority of the strip has stopped offering free self-parking). A few other things to note: if you’re like me and start your day late because your night went well into the morning the rooms have blackout curtains that keep everything pitch black and even though you’re right across the arena the sounds from outside barely bleed in. I’ll definitely be coming back.
30,AC did not work. No accommodations or refund rebate. Pretty sure a few times it was ignored when I mentioned. My safe did not work either. Paper thin walls could here neighbors. Bar staff was very friendly.
30,Great staff and ideal location for the strip but my room wasn’t cleaned from the previous guest did not feel comfortable in my room. Bathroom was covered in hair I found food on my floor. I was impressed with the staff but wasn’t impressed by the cleanliness of the room.
50,Super fun clean smoke free casino. Hotel has great restaurants and is in a great location. It is close to the Aria tram t-mobile arena and walkable to the rest of the strip. Too cold for the pools but they look nice and clean as well.
30,We stood in front of him for 20 mins and this old white bartender and his asian partner at the casino floor bar ignored us the the whole time. Soon as a young pretty women walked up next to us all of a sudden they as her what they can get her.
50,Very clean rooms. Anyone we asked questions to was very helpful. The no smoking policy is great. Walked into a few other casinos and you could smell the difference. We would choose them again for our next trip.
50,We have been staying at Park MGM every since they opened and have been so pleased with this hotel every time. Rooms are clean they have the friendliest staff and rewards are good We Love the non-smoking casino. It’s the perfect sized casino with a great selection of slots. Also location is perfect- Close to everything.
20,Totally excited into the casino only to be told we would not be given the room reserved unapologetically. He made the excuse that it was Super Bowl Sunday. It was the same Sunday when i reserved the room. Then we get to the room only to be greeted by two bags of trash. Should have canceled and gotten a different hotel.
30,Location is not the greatest as it is on one end of the strip and getting in and out is horrible during Golden Knights games. Enjoyed having Eatlay in the lobby Best Friend is a great restaurant as well. Mattresses are not the greatest and sag to one side.
40,No smoking hotel and casino was great. I didn’t care for the color scheme of the suites the view was only a small window. The service was good and the food at the eatly was excellent. Really wish there was a coffee maker in room even if we had to pay for the coffee
50,great totally non-smoking casino and hotel located right in the middle of the strip between New York New York and Aria with easy access to Bellagio on the tram or a short trip to the tram to Mandalay Bay and Luxor
50,This was a great trip. The staff here has AWESOME customer skills!! From the front desk and on every staff member I ran into were VERY friendly and helpful no matter what time of day or night or how busy they were. I had a little problem with the shower and it was fixed quickly. I'll be staying here again.🙂
50,The Park is classy yet understated. They are clearly trying hard to please but it isn’t over the top or excessive. Great location friendly staff and you can’t beat having Eataly right downstairs especially for your early morning coffee and pastry needs!
50,Everything was good......except the parking on concert nights.......as guests of the hotel.........you should be able to access the parking garage with out the hassles and wait times......unbelievable........
40,We have stayed at the Park MGM over 20 times dated back to when it was the Monte Carlo. We checked in and received an old room that still had the Monte Carlo bathtub and shower instead of the walk in showers. Front desk was nice enough to put us in a new room.  The property is always clean and staff are somewhat friendly. We stayed at a different property for the first time the last half of our trip and was amazed at how every person that helped us asked if we had a rewards card! Never been asked that at the Park! Had one employee say they had never seen the players card! The new point system is harder to level up which is a shame. It’s a nice property to stay but you will find yourself walking to other properties to find places to eat because not many options at the park.
50,it was great. We enjoyed everything about the hotel. I would go there again  the hotel staff was great including housekeeping staff. we also enjoyed the quietness and restaurants were good as well. it was walkable.
50,This smoke free hotel made my trip to Vegas possible. Not only could I breathe easier but the scents in the hotel were reminiscent and not overpowering. The staff made our experience easier as well. Every staff member we encountered was friendly and asked how they could help make our trip better. Everything is decorated beautifully the beds are comfortable and the shower was heavenly. I can’t wait to bring my husband here.
50,Stayed for a Tuesday - Friday birthday trip and really enjoyed the experience. I had only stayed at NYNY prior to this and think Park MGM will be where I stay in the future. The size is great - not too big or small - and absolutely LOVED that the entire property is smoke free. We stayed in a Nightingale Suite and enjoyed the extra space. Because everything in the mini fridge is on weight sensors we couldn't use it but figured out we could fill the bar sink with ice and used that to keep drinks cool. The suites are very near the ice machine so that was super convenient. The suites have a water closet inside the bathroom for the toilet which helps with multiple people using the bathroom. The shower had awesome pressure and range of temperatures. Really the only issue we encountered was getting the room cool enough but once we dropped the thermostat low enough we got it where we needed. All of the staff were kind attentive and helpful. We ate at Eataly Bavette's and La La Noodle and I honestly hope we get to go back to all three. Can't wait for my next trip here!
40,Good location. Loved the eatly!!! Didn’t really see or talk to any hotel staff but bartenders and dealers in the casino were always super friendly! Eatly was the best part for me. It was super cute very clean and the food is AMAZING.
40,Aside from the above we loved the comfortable mattress and large shower. Expect loud music from T-Mobile arena during events if your room faces in that direction. Parking easy and close to hotel. Use your hotel key prepay for parking self parking perfect probably faster than valet. Casino is not very large not a big deal. Starbucks next to lobby open @6am.
30,We stayed during the week which we knew was going to have very little activity. If you like something off the beaten path this is ideal. I'm use to having 60 degree weather when sleeping and the thermostat/hvac wasn't cooperating. We wasted money buying a water/soda/beer to have in the room since we couldn't keep it cold.
50,We have stayed here 5 times and enjoyed it every time. Such a good location. Close to everything. Loved eating at Best Friends and Eataly. Love that the tram is close by to get to other MGM properties close by.
40,Great location check-in process is easy lots of food options with Eataly being connected (if fan of raisin bread they're a place that makes amazing raisin bread) and close to several other options on the Strip. Love the tram to the Bellagio. Room's are a great size too - beds are comfy. Love that it's a non-smoking casino.
10,We have stayed at Park MGM at least 6 times but this was the first time since the beginning of the pandemic. Wow what a change. The cleanliness of the hotel has really deteriorated! I will not stay here again.
30,Big disappointment in paying Resort fees. What is given to you for that daily $50 fee? Definitely not bottled water in your room. You are charged $8 per bottle. I don’t know if I could stay at this Hotel again paying for something I am not using.
30,The hotel was just OK it was close to the T-Mobile arena. It’s the hotel was very plain minimal hospitality services such as coffee no food to eat after 10 PM. Casino was nice and clean. it was not as clean as I would have liked it to be.
50,Lovely Hotel. This was a family trip and it was very nice. We will definitely come to Vegas again and stay in this hotel. I understand with covid and all the only thing missing was a fridge and microwave.
40,Park MGM has upgraded. With great new food venues and its non-smoking policy it is a much more enjoyable place to stay than the Monte Carlo which previously occupied that space. My one complaint is that the casino appears to have removed some tables which makes things more crowded during the time of COVID-19.
50,This is a PERFECT location if you’re going to an event at the T-Mobile Arena! It’s newer clean non-smoking casinos. The staff was friendly and helpful. A slight issue leaving the parking garage but it was addressed quickly and with no problem. By the way in the parking garage red lights mean the space is occupied and green means a space is open! So much easier to find a spot!! It was a great stay.
50,Loved everything about Park. Will stay again for sure. Great rooms restaurants. Only stayed 3 nights so no time for most amenities but loved Eately. Great food and drinks were had there. When thinking about your stay the Park is non-smoking which is huge if you're a non-smoker. Nothing worse than wreaking of smoke. Wonderful place!!
40,Rooms were clean and rates were excellent. Gym has ample machines and free weights though it was empty during my use. Make sure you book restaurants before your trip. Try Best Friend Korean bbq excellent food and service. Eataly has some nice choices but be prepared to pay. Crack Shack has really good chicken sandwiches entrance is on the strip outside the Eataly.
50,"Park MGM is a great location a great value and our new ""go-to"" resort in Las Vegas. The rooms are good - large showers a plus. But the common spaces are exceptional - and smoke-free. Best of all - Eataly! Through several visits we've now eaten everything from the best pastries and lattes for breakfast to fantastic pizza and pasta for lunch to a perfectly grilled porterhouse for dinner. Absolutely LOVE this place!"
40,We loved the fact that it is a smoke free hotel/casino. The rooms were good and it was a pleasure being able to sit down at a black jack table and not have to inhales someone else's second hand smoke!
40,forget about using cell phone for room key. too much trouble logging into cell phone when you're carrying luggages in elevator. need new towels and cleaner sofa covers. not family friendly. good only for 1-nighter. for a high-end hotel toilet paper is unsanitary! it's re-used and very thin paper. there should be brand new ones!
40,Area is great (we were there for a concert at T-Mobile arena). Check in was easy and the people at the desk were accomodating and pleasant  The room was small and not updated (no refrigerator in room either) but comfortable and good enough for what we needed a pleasure staying in a smoke free casino Eataly was really good and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Park MGM and would definitely stay again (but just ask for a larger room! Lol)
50,Room clean and comfy. EATALY was convenient and delicious! Easy walking from place to place. Tram was so easy to and from Belagio. Also Aria was connected to the hotel. Non-smoking made the place so fresh smelling!
50,Had a wonderful stay at Park MGM! Rooms were very nice and clean and the hotel staff is excellent. Also loved the Primrose for breakfast it was awesome and a convenient Starbucks when you come down from your room. Love the no smoking casino and will definitely stay here again!
50,It was a nice experience. Clean room. Great location. Smoke free environment. The lala Asian restaurant serve great food. I won some money on the roulette table. Overall I had a great time. I will stopping by again soon.
30,Park MGM was a very nice hotel. Many access points to the strip concert and entertainment. Rooms are minimalistic not so great for extented stay 5 days or more. Issues was the odor of marijuana very over powering in hallways of my rooom and the strip.
40,My first time visiting Las Vegas and i loved it. The hotel was exceptional the staff was very helpful and accommodating. You had everything either at the hotel or the surrounding areas. Very much excited to be back!
40,Love being able to play for hours in the casino and not smell like an ash tray. Also super friendly staff and room are nice. This is becoming a favorite place for me and the wife to stay. Also food and the sports bar is amazing.
50,The Park is the best small hotel casino in Vegas it’s smoke free and has great restaurants. Their employees are always helpful and friendly. The Italian market in front on the strip is a great place to eat.
50,Service and commitment at the check in. The room very clean and all accessories like towels soap shampoo; conditioner all set up. Room very quiet fast and secure check out. Parking structure very accessible .
40,A very end of hallway so view was very limited. Room furniture dinged up and needed a bit of care. Green couch did not appear very clean- felt a bit sticky.  Room in 2021 was better and room felt cleaner.
50,Loved the non smoking atmosphere. Basic room nice -great bed pillows black out curtains and shower water pressure. Nothing else in the room. Coffee maker would have been nice. Great location on strip.
50,The hotel remodel is gorgeous. Rooms are nice and beds were comfortable. Only negative is the lack of mini fridges in the room. Top seller for us is how AMAZING it was to have a smoke-free casino and hotel.
50,Very nice. Wish there was a coffee maker and refrigerator . Besides that the room was very nice. Nice size room as well with a couch. Very quite great location next to T-Mobile Arena. Went to concert
50,Loved the No Smoking … went to the Garth concert so very convenient. Went to the steakhouse had a very nice dinner. I look forward to coming back but will choose a different type of room. Drink prices where a little pricey.. $16 for a Jameson and Water !!
50,I found this hotel to be very convenient clean with great service. We were very comfortable and location was awesome close to the strip and other attractions. Will definitely recommend the Park MGM Las Vegas to business associates family and friends.
50,Stayed at ny Tuesday through Friday unfortunately our flight canceled till the following day so stayed one night at park mgm was really impressed with how nice the room was also loved tram to bellagio
50,"Convenient location on the Strip not fanciest most spectacular resort but the ONLY ONE I know of where you can pass through or spend a long time in the casino without your clothes smelling like you are a chain smoker yourself. Room was clean and comfy. Primrose Restaurant breakfast was a bit pricey but delicious! Park MGM gets a 10 as a perfect NON-SMOKING option in the Strip. If they didn't have that NS policy their rating would fall again because there are lots of newer ""I love my clothes smelling of stale cigarette smoke"" options. If you don't care about your laundry...go someplace else. But we will return to the Park MGM as long as they stay on course and give all of us non-smokers a place to enjoy!"
20,Checked in walked to room keys didnt work (maybe the batteries were dead on the lock). Had security escort us. Was told by the elevator they couldn't let us in if anything was wrong anyway. Was my idea to swap rooms. It was an hour for maintenance or a 4th floor or a handicap room. After waisting an hour at check in I ended up with a handicap room anyway. No-one took ownership and No-one seemed to care at all. Ended up gambling elsewhere because if customer service is this poor at this point it cNt get better.
50,My family and I enjoyed our entire stay in this hotel. I loved how clean this hotel was overall. Front desk was awesome and were able to meet my requests. Staff was friendly and very helpful. Non-smoking was definitely a plus. Planning to book here again in the summer!
50,Our stay at the Park MGM was great. All the staff was very friendly and helpful and our room exceeded our expectations in terms of comfort. The location of this hotel was great for our show at the tmobile arena and easy to get around to other parts on the strip. We would stay here again!
40,Comfortable hotel. Staff very nice especially front desk. Good restaurants but none open after midnight. Particularly liked Bavette’s and Eataly. Location on the Strip far South not the best but liked the tram to Bellagio.
50,This was such a beautiful hotel. The check in process was fast and everyone at the front desk was awesome! Everyone that works there was extremely friendly. There’s a lot of great restaurants and the mood is very romantic!! I love it
50,I had never heard of this hotel until I visited Vegas Super Bowl weekend. I booked my room from the hotel lobby after a nightmare online booking at a different hotel and I was pleasantly surprised with my stay at Park MGM. Great room great vibes and great stay for a reasonable price. Crystal at the front desk and supervisor Justin were superb. I definitely will return.
50,The rooms are nice and large. The staff is friendly and helpful. There are several restaurant choices including an excellent steak place. Access to free tram and convenient walking distance to many venues. Taxi stand is fast and efficient.
40,A truly quiet place but is a nice surpise for it's location. If you like Mandalay Bay but you find it too far from everything then the Park Mgm is the place to stay. It's smoke free so not for everyone. But it's clean and have a lot of places to eat and drink. A better alternative to the Cromwell with a way better location.
40,Love the location of Park MGM. Close to shopping great restaurants and bars. Staff are exceptional rooms are spacious and clean. NON SMOKING facility is key!!! Need to open the other two pools but that could be time of year factor. Overall highly recommend the Park! Can’t wait to come back!!
40,Just had another amazing experience at ParkMGM our goto spot when in Vegas. Great service clean rooms great staff. Hands down one of the best hotels on the strip! Only reason I gave 4 out of 5 stars is because no one is perfect and there is always room for improvement no matter how small the detail.
50,The Park MGM was a great hotel to stay at. It is a great location for the T-Mobile Arena and the Allegiant Stadium. It has a tram that will take you to the Bellagio as well to cut down on the walking. The rooms were clean and the staff was friendly!
40,Great location with access to the bus line just across the walk bridge.The smoke free casino is a huge deal and the comfy clean rooms make it a one of the best deals on the strip! Don’t forget they have the NoMad inside the Park as well and that is by far one of the best rooms on the strip!
50,Centrally located on the strip has good dining and a Starbucks inside. Easy walk to shopping on the Strip. The pool is small but we didn’t stay there to go swimming. Short walk to Aria for fine dining like Javier’s or little Italy. Also the T-Mobile arena is across the street.
10,Place has gone way downhill. No desk or dresser in room bed not worthy of a homeless shelter. Staff unengaged. Room price was good but $25 to park and $45 for resort fees are not worth it for a lousy product. $3500 buy-in on blackjack table barely gets a yawn from pit boss. MGM properties have left the hospitality business and are in the real estate business. We were supposed to stay for four nights but left after the first night.
50,Had a great time. Great service. Very clean. Love the smoke free casino. It felt cleaner and smelled cleaner because of it.  Great location close to other mgm locations. We will definitely be back next year.
20,I paid for this hotel in advance directly through Park MGM not a third party. This turned out to be a headache because no one seemed to understand this. They post your account balance on the television. Well i literally had to take time out of my day each day of my vacation to have my bill corrected. So frustrating. Secondly i arrived to a room that had not been properly cleaned. They did send someone to take care of the issues with the room and provided a $50 F&B credit. Using the credit was another headache. We spent exactly $50 at the Primrose restaurant but was still double charged to our room. I again had to spend time on the phone with guest services to get this corrected. The hotel rooms in this hotel were nothing special. The hallways are dark and dated. The rooms are dated. I don’t see anything remodeled. A plus was it’s a non smoking hotel and we had a nice view. I did like that but not enough to stay here again. Too much time on the phone with guest services. Long waits to get things resolved. Dirty room.
50,We recently stayed at Park MGM for a work trip. The whole experience was wonderful but the true highlight for us was a security guard named Hank Graae. After a long day we were wandering around the Eataly market looking for some chocolate and a bottle of wine. Hank was so quick to jump in and help us find the best wine. He has been studying Italian wine for a few years now and was very knowledgeable. He went above and beyond to make sure our time at Park MGM was truly a joy. Thanks Hank!
50,Nice view and very minimalist. Didn't have to interact with anyone to park check in and check out. The price wasn't bad for a mid week vacation in the middle of the strip tho the resort fees bumped the price up it still was affordable
50,Great to be back in Vegas after some tough times! Park mgm was great! Great room with an amazing view! Checked in online and it was super quick and easy! Highly recommend plus we love it a no smoking casino
50,We stayed at Park MGM while in town to see George Strait. We loved the convenient location. It was easy to navigate and nicely decorated.  Many options for dining. We enjoyed them all! Friendly staff and best of all- Smoke Free!
50,We have stayed at the Park MGM 3 times now and it is such a great place to stay. Always clean great location. Lots of options. Rooms are a good size. Restaurants are very good. No Smoking in this hotel/casino.
50,We stayed at Park MGM during Super Bowl weekend. It was not as busy which was a good thing. The hotel was pretty clean and love the non-smoking aspect. Check in was super easy and I never even had to talk to the front desk. My daughter had a great time at the pool. The only thing that was not great is the Starbucks line downstairs was long and took quite some time every day.    All in all we would return to this property.
50,How refreshing! Loved it here! First time staying here in 20+ trips to Vegas. Rooms nicely renovated with fresh clean feel. Sofa modern furnishings comfortable beds amazing bathrooms with make up mirror & convenient shelving outside shower excellent water pressure. Connected to Aria tram to Bellagio. Excellent location on Strip slightly South from centre Strip next to T-Mobile Arena & NYNY Casino. Eataly Italian Marketplace close to Target & CVS. Out of all the MGM hotels I've stayed at this is by far my favourite. Stayed in Oct.2021 & again in Jan.2022..staff very friendly & helpful & non-smoking which adds to it's fresh updated feel.
40,Hotel was lovely but no refrigerator or microwave all the rooms should have at least one. Hotel is clean and the service was awesome I felt like I was in Europe the entire time! I wish we had a better view
50,The hotel was great I had a great time I did not have any issues with nothing related to the hotel. I enjoy my state and everything was up to specs. The staff was very friendly and helpful to me and my family
10,Uncomfortable bed. Wifi did not work. Loud music was literally heard throughout the whole day and night coming from outside and we were on the 18th floor. Unreal. I've stayed here 3 of the last 4 superbowl weekends and this was by far the worse stay.
40,We have stayed here many of times in the past mainly because of the convenient location on the strip and to TMobile arena. The room we had this time was a 2 queen bed strip view. You really don't see much of the strip but do see roof tops and air conditioner units galore. Check in went smooth using the mobile app. The bathroom was gross and not cleaned until we went to the front desk and complained. Eataly was great once you figure it out. Bring your own water drinks snacks. Slots were not our friend during this visit but the smoke free casino always is.
50,A very good property! All you need is there just steps away. Right across the street from the T-Mobile Arena. Service was awesome. If there is one problem for me the bed was way to soft. I really like a firm mattress. Everything else was awesome!
40,Rooms are getting a little worn but very clean. The customer service is outstanding. Great value for where this hotel is on the strip. Will go back again. My husband loved the long couch for the super bowl
50,Everything was awesome. Only minor inconvenience was that our room was located near the arena and the arena has music playing 24/7 so it interrupted our sleep a couple times. Other than that the room was great.
50,Toshi amd lisa from the milder rewards department addressed our concerns and helped us out significantly - we were initially downgraded from gold status to sapphire despite spending significant monies over the years- we even went to the mgm casinos when they first reopened but due to Covid restrictions we could not get up there as much as usual - Instead of never going back again because of our frustration- Lisa and Toshi truly treated us fairly and we retained our gold status-
30,We were so excited for a smoke free experience and right next to the T-Mobile center. The staff were amazing and we had fun at the slots! The drinks were made strong! The only thing lacking was a good night sleep due to the worlds most uncomfortable bed.
20,The guest rooms need MAJOR renovations! We were very disappointed and fell short of our expectations for a 4.0 star resort (we were charge a ‘Resort’ fee) on the Las Vegas Strip! The lobby and common areas were updated but MGM skipped out on the guest rooms. We will not stay at this hotel again.
50,Love the hotel and eately room was exceptional. Restaurants were amazing the wait staff was friendly. Convenient location.so many options close by for food and beverage. Would definitely return. We had a great time
30,We were in town for the George Strait concert so the Park was very convenient to that location.  It was difficult to stay in our room for an extended period of time because of the sewer smell coming from the air vent in the restroom.  The room and bathroom itself were very clean.
20,We prefer a room with a few drawers and a mini fridge and a bathroom counter. Also like the bathroom cleaned daily although the clean towels every day was good but we like a clean bathroom floor too.
50,Being smoke free in a city that now allows pot smoking in public areas is huge for me. I really wish that all casinos would go to a smoke free environment for the sake of everyone's health. That being said I have stayed here before and love the central location on the Strip.
30,No room service! Had to go to the desk at 3PM to get more towels and have someone empty the trash. No one ever apologized either! Not a very good first impression. I expected more. The room was clean and the location convenient. Food at Eatley was yummy!
50,I stayed a few days at the Bellagio and then one day at MGM Park. Bellagio was high end clean great service but 2x the price and everything costs 2 x what it should. MGM Park had some great features - room was clean and large. Easy check in no smoking you dont have to walk through casino to get to elevator. great restaurants and bars connected to Eataly so you can get all kinds of great food next to NYNY so easy access to all the fun and good food there. Alot of outside eating choices at both NYNY and MGM Park  which is a big deal during covid! I think the pool was open in January. Also a tram that takes you to Bellagio and other hotels which is nice! So in the middle of the strip  without ALWAYS feeling like you are in the middle of vegas. Also a great casino and i liked the look of the sports betting sports bar restaurant. Also there were no events but i really like being next to the stadium and all that area has to offer. It was a great value  but i bet the price goes up when there is a hockey game there. One warning I was on a very high floor but still heard music until 3am from i think outside. You can hear noises from other rooms. But  your in Vegas.
30,1. It took four attempts to get my bill corrected  2. No coffee maker in the room... Had to overpay for coffee at Starbucks and Eataly every day.  3. No refrigerator in the room. $35 per day. Really?  4. Was part of a leadership team that had a company meeting at the Park MGM and felt we were overcharged for many BASIC items (AV related.. cables etc.)
50,My husband and I love to visit Las Vegas. We especially love to stay at Park MGM. We live the atmosphere location and we really love the food. Eataly has everything we could ever want. We also love LA LA Noodle… their food is amazing. Can not wait to visit again.
30,I love that the hotel is smoke free. It’s a very beautiful hotel and the eataly food court is amazing. The only problem I had was the cleanliness of the room. The hotel advertises “very clean” but upon inspection of the room I noticed a few things.. smears on walls and mirrors dusty nightstand food stains on lamp dusty curtains dirty carpets hair and lint on sheets (smelt clean maybe staff hair?) mold on the drain opening of kitchen sinks etc.great service and awesome online check in. Also walls were pretty thin I could hear neighbors opening doors all night.
40,Stayed here during our last family trip with kids. Love that it is a non-smoking hotel; definitely great for the little ones. Wish dining options were open later than 10pm - employees starting shutting down 15 minutes before closing so had to go elsewhere. Thankfully New York New York is right next door and had great late night selections.
50,Room was great and had air purifier adding to great white noise and a good sleep.  Service was really friendly quick and enthusiastic to help from the front desk to the servers on the casino floor.  Casino is clean and the air is fresh. We really like the Non Smoking aspect and had a great time with many games. We came for a concert at TMobile arena and the location was just across the street.
50,Great rooms that are reasonable. Gambling is always good and close to activities. We saw the Garth show at Dolby Live and Kane Brown at T-Mobile so the location was perfect for us. Rooms could use better bathroom storage but that's not a deal killer for me.
50,Stayed in vegas many times and this was our first at park mgm. Really enjoyed it - room was nice resultant and bars were well serviced and the staff very friendly. Special mention to the Primrose restaurant as it was superb. Great value hotel and will def return .
50,Great employees clean rooms and casino. Any issues are taken care of immediately. Thank you Dustin (front desk) for your help. Close to everything on the strip. Parking very convenient and easy and the spa is a great amenity.
20,Room was dated but clean. Casino gaming was very limited. One good thing that Eataly is there. Friendly and knowledgeable front desks. The vibe of the hotel is depressing and boring. Price is on the low end side
50,I had a great time at Park MGM. I’ve stayed here twice and enjoyed both stays. Easy to navigate and good location on the strip. Attached to Aria as well so plenty of great places to eat between the two. I’ll definitely be back!
50,Loved the location since we were there for a concert at T Mobile arena. It is right across the street! Check in was easy. Requested a high floor room and had a view of the strip. The casino is non smoking and clean! The restaurant choices were full of variety. Eataly is wonderful! Juniper lounge is a delight. It has the largest gin selection. The drinks taste great and the presentation stellar. If you are a beer drinker Beerhaus is right across the street . There is also a free tram to the Bellagio.
20,Digital key cards and spotty wifi make getting to your room difficult also can't go to other floors. ONLY your floor. Had to meet my friend at the casino & have her take me to her floor. Very inconvenient to bring coffee!
50,Park MGM and all the MGM properties are above top notch. I don't want to go anywhere else. Decided to do a honeymoon staycation for the Garth Brooks experience and we couldn't have had a better time. Would stay here and play here again!
50,The park is the best value on the strip. From the New York themed rooms to some of Las Vegas finest dining in a smoke free environment makes the park stand out above the rest. From Bavettes a Las Vegas institution to the Nomad restaurant and Eataly to Lala noodles the food selections are as diverse as they are delicious.    If you are looking for an upscale place to enjoy amazing drinks and incredible staff look no further than Juniper lounge. I have loved in Las Vegas for many years and was a regular guest here before moving. I am not sure how I missed this incredible spot but I did. When you are in Las Vegas this a place not to be missed and yet somehow I did until this visit. When you go do your self a favor and order the signature drinks. It is other worldly experience. They serve not only drinks that are exceptional but the presentation is something special.    I have to comment on the best service we have ever had in Las Vegas. Letie and the staff at juniper are exceptional. Letie is kind personable and very knowledgeable and helpful on the selections there. She has incredible skill at knowing what flavor profiles work together and seeks to understand your preferences and then makes drink recommendations that are spot on. We are frequent travelers and we found Letie to be not only an extraordinary host to our night but an incredible human being.    Thank you to Park and especially Letie for making this the most memorable stay ever in Las Vegas.    P.S. I have stayed on the strip over 50x
50,This was my first stay at the Park MGM after many years at Caesars' properties. The Park MGM is a great location very clean modern  and close to many other MGM properties all with many good food choices.  I highly recommend staying at the Park MGM.
50,"Came to Vegas to celebrate my 50th Birthday. Had a blast! Loved this hotel. The hotel is in the perfect location to have access to the rest of the strip. Staff was great ""Eatlay""was good rooms were clean. I would book there again"
50,Really nice and clean the staff is really friendly and very helpful. I had no big issues in the resort. The resort is located right in the middle of everything which was very convenient. Will stay there again.
50,We arrived early like 11 am because we transfered from Golden nugget and had out luggage as we spent the week in Vegas. They got me check in and in my room with haste. Room was very clean and comfortable. The bed and pillows provided were spectacular. The staff was always ready to render assistance when asked. Great stay thank you!
20,We checked into the Park MGM for two nights. The moment we stepped foot in the room I was displeased. We were on the fourth floor room 328 (right side of the right wing hallway) and you could hear music from the Beerhaus park across the street as if you were sitting on a park bench outside. That never stopped. I didn’t sleep at all. Because the entire night there was music blaring and the hotel had absolutely no sound proofing to mitigate that.    I could hear the upstairs occupant pulling the draw cord on their blinds and showering. And then to just top it off a family with a screaming kid was put in the room next to us and they had the tv on which you can hear through the wall like it’s on in your room.    I went down to the desk and asked to switch rooms and they did instantly apologize and move my husband and i into a room on the other side which was MUCH quieter. But the attendant who helped me knew exactly why I was complaining when I told him which room I was in so this is obviously a regular complaint. This interaction and our checkin process were magnificent the staff was extremely friendly and I want that well known. It’s the hotel itself that is the problem.    While the new room was much quieter the occupants next door turned the tv on and it was still audible through the wall as well as loud talking.    They need to invest in major soundproofing because this was unbearable. We will NEVER stay here again.    Oh and yes the hallways ARE reminiscent of The Shining and it turns out I am not the only guest to have that thought.
30,Shower head had really bad calcium lime build up and the water barely came out. The sink took forever to drain. The bench was infested with dog hair. The towels reeked of bleach. We really love this hotel but they missed the mark this time.
50,We really like staying at the Park MGM. It's a great location on the Strip...we like going to the other hotels/casinos nearby. We LOVE that it's smoke-free. I cannot say that enough! We also love that the casino is low-key and I actually find playing there to be relaxing. I also love that it's not too big so it doesn't take forever to get to our room. The food is amazing. We've loved everything we've tried. We will definitely be back!
40,Our suite was average a little run down but for the price it was what we expected. We really like that this hotel and casino are smaller. I can not get over the $18 room service coffee or 45 min wait at Starbucks and will take morning coffee availability in to account next trip. Service to the tables in the casino was terrible spent most of my gambling time downtown because of this.
40,The non-smoking throughout the entire hotel and casino is excellent. Very good food and selection.. roons were clean. Elevators were fast. Checkun was easy. Good choice of slots and table games.👍👍👍👍👍👍
50,I appreciated the non-smoking hotel in a great location on the strip. The hotel was well maintained and the dining on site was fabulous. We also appreciated the easy access to the aria tram allowing quick transportation to aria the crystals bellagio and everything in between.
30,Everything has changed. Like the smoke free environment! Missed the feel of the old Monte Carlo. Everything I liked about it is gone. The Italian themed food court was great but too many carbs for a person to eat.
20,The casino was fine. The hotel part was the issue. Yes it was clean but the hallways are dark- like “The Shining” dark. We expected two little girls to invite us to play with them… forever…  Also we had a fantastic view of…. Air conditioning units. For almost $600 for the two nights we expected far better. We spend as little time in the room as possible.
30,We like to stay a the the Park MGM when attending the Golden Knights Games due to the great location. We purposefully reserved rooms way in advance for the NHL All Star Weekend. We arrived and checked into our room. We walked in and found that the second bed was made but the sheets were dirty and their was hair still on the shower floor. We notified the front desk who sent housekeeping up right away but it was not the way to start a weekend that we had been looking forward to.
50,I Loved the rooms cozy and alot of space for. Casino is such a fun environment and food court is the best in my opinion. bell desk is super cool and fast service when it comes to room service aswell.
20,For some reason (i.e. profit) the Park MGM Grand has removed coffee machines refrigerators and microwaves from their room. You basically have to head to their lobby for a $8 coffee or $6 bottle of water if you want any refreshment at all. Additionally their staff seems like they would rather be anywhere else.
40,We won and had fun however it was hard to get cocktail service at slots. Best Friends Korean Restaurant is the bomb! Enjoyed the food alot. We didn't make a reservation we just did the front area...if you see empty table in front you can eat there no need to eat in main area.
40,Love the non-smoking casino and rooms! Would of liked a refrigerator but it doesn’t seem that’s a priority in Vegas! Clean room. Close to shopping and food. CVS right down the block of anything is needed. Overall great stay. Get the suite if you can.
50,Great Customer Service Very Clean and Great Staff. Didn't have to call to have room cleaned. Room was stocked with water and other items to eat. Staff was very nice with on time request. It was one call that all
50,I love Park MGM property ♥️. I've stayed here twice and love the service I've received and the accommodations. I love that Park MGM is smoke-free. I would definitely book my stay again and again when I visit Las Vegas!
50,Everything was very comfortable. Never left the Park over two days. Had a service dog and he was welcome in all areas. Good casino atmosphere; sports book a little small. Everyone was friendly in all areas.
50,Been to Vegas many times first time here property is great - check in & check out super simple staff is highly recommended and very friendly I will be back soon drinks- bars- casinos - all good!!
50,Great hotel Room was nice they waived my parking fee which is $15 a night which I think is ridiculous We only had to pay for the resort fee the room was free so that was nice but if I had to pay for the room the resort for you in the parking I wouldn’t be happy
50,Enjoyed my stay love the casino and room very clean and no smoking made it a nice place to stay.  Will stay here again cause the price was good and affordable the staff was helpful and friendly thank you
50,The room was clean and nice. Contactless check-in was very convenient our room key was electric through the app but it wouldn't work when trying to get out of the parking garage had to call the attendant each time. We only stayed one night but we enjoyed it.
50,All staff treated us like royalty. Our room was especially clean and the window view of the strip was fabulous. We especially enjoyed our meals in the primrose under Jeremy’s special care. We would love to return for another visit as the location on the strip was superb!!
40,The 3 0's on the roulette wheel change is a joke as is paying out 6-5 on a Blackjack. Horrible. And I'm always shown to have lost less or won more than what I really did (on the MLife website). The program isn't great about comps.
40,Shower door didn't close well so bathroom floor was always a puddle after shower.  Bathroom sink clogged up once I did not call anyone but maintenance fixed it the same day. Business partner's room had no water one day he called maintenance and they fixed it and gave him some credit for the room. I should have called maintenance.
40,Location is great close to lots of restaurant options and the TMobile arena. The room very comfortable and quiet. Mini fridge and coffee maker were not included but those are my only complaints. I plan on staying here again.
50,Love the Park MGM. Non-smoking casino. Friendly knowledgeable staff. Good location. Lots of good restaurants. The property is also home to Eataly which has lot of options for food and beverages. The Italian street food booth is my favorite.
40,Went for a concert at the T mobile arena and this hotel is perfectly located for that. It was clean also it’s smoke free which is amazing. Easy in and out of the hotel and casino. Priced at a fair price.
20,Non-smoking casino no refrigerator bad selection of dining options electronic key from the app almost never worked the water went in and out multiple times I actually left the hotel a day earlier because I was so dissatisfied with the room. Very clean tho but the pillows were large and bulky so the sleep was crappy.
50,ParkMGM is much better than it was when it reopened a few years ago. Its staff people and supervisors went above-and-beyond numerous times to fix room room account and rewards account issues. The bad news is they had to do that and I wasted a few hours over 5 days with this. Hotel badly needs wider food choices especially quick and casual options but for this location we would strongly consider staying there again. You have to figure out how to work the system.
50,This was a pleasure trip to get away from the East Coast for a couple of days. I was able to take full advantage of the rewards program. Check in Was no contact electronic key sent to phone room and floor assignments given before I arrived. I didn’t have to go to the counter at all I loved it rooms need clean modern enjoyed the visit
10,Worst hotel I’ve stayed at on the Strip. Rooms are not up to par a/c didn’t work shower broke on last day no sound proof at all!! Did not honor our $100 spa credit we booked thru Amex package. Manager never even came to speak to us.
50,"Very clean conveniently located and provided a great environment for our weekend trip to Las Vegas. It is a NON-SMOKING hotel and casino! The only one on the strip at the time of this review. That's the main reason we booked a room there. Everything is modern and clean especially compared to some of the ""older"" hotels on the strip that are in desperate need of an upgrade. Bring GOOD walking shoes if you want to fully experience the strip. We walked around 30 miles total...our biggest single day total was over 13 miles.    We loved that we were able to go to all of the different MGM properties located on the strip and charge dining back to our room at the Park."
50,So convenient to check in using the MGM app use our phones and the key to the room ease of adding guest to the room so that you can easily share the room key. Many restaurants and dining options to choose from on-site. Non-smoking facility was much appreciated. The place is kept so clean and smells clean.
50,The water pressure in my room was EXCELLENT i never wanted to get out of it haha the beds were very comfortable was well. i slept more peacefully there than i have in my own house the past few weeks. Book now you wont be disappointed.
40,With The Park being NON SMOKING facility in 100% of the hotel makes it the BEST and HOTTEST hotel in Vegas. Small and Quaint but plenty of action. great Location makes for many options. Do not miss this place!
40,Pros:  On the strip  Clean spacious room  No contact check in and check out  Mobile key available  Eataly on site.  Located in a good spot  Early check in and late check out available for a fee    Cons:  Resort fee  No extras in the room like a coffee maker  Water didn’t drain properly in shower  Towels were thin    Check in: arrived from the airport via lyft ($13-$15). Prior to even arriving I had already checked in online and they had sent me a confirmation that my room was ready. I opted for early check in since my flight arrived early. I went straight to my room thanks for my mobile key.    Room: I was on the 16th floor. The room was a two queen bedroom. Both beds were comfortable. The room also had a couch. I like that they had enough plugs and USB ports to accommodate both beds.    The bathroom was clean. Toiletries included bar soap shampoo conditioner and lotion. There was plenty of vanity space. The shower pressure was good but the the water didn’t drain fast enough so I was always in a pool of dirty water when showering.  The room is equipped with a safe. They also have an iron.  I do wish they at least had a coffee pot in the room.    Check out: easy. Checked out on the app.    Extra:  Each floor has an ice machine.  The property has Eataly on the first floor which has different stands where you can buy delicious pizza sandwiches and other items.  Starbucks is also on the first floor  Ride share picks you up on the north entrance.
20,Clean and decent but just not worth it. It was more expensive than Ny Ny high I feel has a better bang for the buck. We didn’t spend any time in that casino because it was so limited and the room was dated. However the water pressure was the best part. Wish I stayed in any other hotel.
20,Upon check in we found hair on the bathroom counters and floor. The toilet had used toilet paper stuck on the inside of the bowl. Our window gave us a view of a stucco wall. The carpet was old and stained. The casino is nice and the location is great. I was really disappointed with the room. I travel a lot and this is one of the worst rooms that I've ever stayed in.
20,Bright red room and shower…really? Also non smoking…didn’t see that advertised or wouldn’t have chosen it. Was there for activities at T-MOBILE arena so location was excellent for our needs…would not go back…overpriced food and not very many choices…
50,This hotel is just above average it was nice when it 1st opened but all the foot traffic they failed to keep up with the cleanliness of it. Its better than alot of hotels on the strip but would be better if they kept up with it. Rooms are small but the shower in the rooms are awesome. Wish the rooms matched the awesomeness.
10,terrible never again. pit bosses at 3 card poker where out of control with mask mandates!! i took a drink of my beer and Pit boss with ballistic. i explained that i was drinking! He didn't care and called cops. when cops got there they appoligized to us! They told us they have nothing but problems from those two pit bosses.
50,Ever get to your hotel only to find a line wrapping around the hotel lobby? not at Park mgm you can check in from the convenience of your cell phone and have a key card to your hotel room via the mgm mobile app. With this I can avoid the front desk and be assigned my room from anywhere on the strip
50,If you are traveling with kids check out this hotel. It has smoke-free casino and rooms. It’s less crowded than other hotels in strip. We had great comfy & cozy family time in Vegas staying at this hotel!
50,This was our third time staying at Park MGM and I absolutely love the location and the fact that it’s a non-smoking casino. Everybody is always so friendly and they really helped us out when I accidentally booked our stay for the wrong month. Also the bed was super comfortable and I got such great sleep which is difficult for me at most hotels.
30,It’s the only smoke free hotel on the strip. I appreciate this. My room was below average. I hope no one on that floor had to pay because then I would be really upset. Our room was comp and it felt that way. Our view was of what looked to be a service room on the roof on the 3rd floor. The only problem with this is that there is no natural light whatsoever. We were basically in a cave. The staff at the front desk (the phone front desk not the actual front desk - these are apparently 2 separate places) was unpleasant. MLife tier matching is a joke. Why advertise that if you don’t receive the perks of the tier you are matched with. Basically I stay here if it’s the cheapest option mostly because the location is good and I can appreciate not smelling like an ashtray by the end of the night. Otherwise go somewhere else.
50,The resort was nice and clean and the fact it’s a non smoking place is a huge plus. The artwork throughout the place was neat and quite eclectic. Primrose offered a great breakfast and Best Friend is a dinner place we will most definitely return to
50,The Park MGM is the only resort this smoke free!! The resort is clean and nice! The location is great too. I stay here every time I go to Las Vegas. Great options for dinning. Lots of new slot video games!
50,My trip to Vegas was to celebrate my Mother’s birthday and we were able to see a lot of cool things and eat great food! Overall the trip was a success! We all will return for another trip because our stay was super great!!!
40,Overall was a good experience. Hotel was in a prime location and easy access to a lot of areas. My room was available prior to hotel check in time which was great. A couple complimentary bottles of water in the room would’ve been appreciated.
50,We made the trip for the Garth brooks show. Mobile check in was smooth -room was clean staff friendly casino was clean could use a few more servers on the floor but other than that it was a great stay
30,Love that it’s non-smoking. Casio is cool. Rooms are bad. Hallway to the rooms are gross. All carpets needs to be changed ASAP. Nasty. Rooms desperately need upgrading. I can’t believe MGM can’t spend some money to upgrade this place.
50,Rooms and common area were very clean. We enjoyed the smoke free casino. A great location on the strip. Wide variety of games in the casino. Nice relaxed atmosphere. Great place to stay if you are attending a game or concert at T-Mobile arena. We will stay here again. If you like to bet on games... Park MGM does have a sports book and sports bar but it doesn't have large area to watch a large variety of sports at once.
20,Decent for the price. Arrived in our room to find poop/ and or throw up all over our toilet seat. At that point no upgrade was made to change our room. Then both our keys stopped working second day. Very updated and the staff tries but not recommended. There’s better places to stay in Vegas
40,Park MGM is a hidden gem right in the center of the action in Vegas! It is newly remodeled smoke free and right in the middle of the strip. The rooms are comfy the restaurants have a huge variety of things to choose from and you’re within a short walking distance to NY NY and Aria.
30,Rooms are not that great. Not much to look at or entertain guests. The Italian food court is the best thing there. Hotel overall needs a total remodel. Prices of everything is completely rediculous and the fact that you have to pay to use the jacuzzi is just absurd.
20,I wouldn’t recommend- there are so many amazing places to stay in Vegas. Go somewhere with a little more upscale a feel. Staff was great and location is convenient. Design is pretty bad everything still feels old and very dark/dingy. Very thin walls. Like zero sleep thin walls.
10,Hotel allows other customers to move your room next to theirs that aren’t even on your reservation and puts in notes that the person on the reservation is not to be allowed to move it away from theirs! This creates a huge safety concern!! Parking keys never worked there was a fight at front door where a customer picked up a huge rock and threw it at security and the doors. Rooms are not up to par. Very dark and unclean. First and last time staying here.
40,Hotel has a great atmosphere. The casino restaurants and stores inside make it so there’s always something to do. Rooms are kinda lackluster but clean and comfortable. AMAZING shower pressure/shower
20,First time at the Park MGM mynroom was not ready and I had to drop my bag at the luggage check. HAROLD the person taking your bags was extremely rude. Seemed Ilike he doesn't want to be there and expecting you will tip just for taking your bag.and put it in the back room. Be aware!!!
40,Nice property towards the end of the strip. Rooms were clean and affordable having Eately in the lobby provides some good eating choices without leaving. This hotel is right in front of the hockey arena which would be fun on a game night and easy.
40,This was my first trip to Vegas. We came to watch Michigan basketball in a tournament. The tournament was at T-Mobil Arena which was right next door to the Park MGM. Location was great for the basketball games and also for most things in the strip.    The hotel was vey nice. Things felt outdated in areas but our room had recently been updated. There were plenty of food options right in the hotel. The casino area was very clean and had anything you could want.    We did have an issue at the pool. Since it was cold for most people the pool areas were not busy. We wanted to sit in the sun but only a few areas around the pool were open. Many chairs that were in the sun were either by in closed areas or you had to pay to sit there.    We did enjoy the hotel but with so many options for somewhere to stay we would try somewhere else next time.
20,If you want a cup of coffee in the morning be prepared to wait for the stores to open and then wait in line forever. Zero perks at this hotel. No coffee or water in rooms. Disappointed at the amount of time wasted looking for things and waiting in line.
40,It really does live up to it’s non smoking policy. Clean atmosphere  great location mostly Italian food  could have a wider selection of dining. Actually got a good nights rest despite being a light sleeper. Would return knowing it’s minimum and consistent standard.
30,Tables are not in the player’s favor at all. 6/5 blackjack and 8 decks used on $15-$25 minimum tables. Staff demands for tips when playing even if you win a hand or two. It’s not what it used to be. Hard to want to go back.
30,All things considered this was a fairly good deal while still being on the strip. The live music across the park was a bit obnoxious and I only found out at checkout that the resort fee was unavoidable.
40,Spent a week here i enjoyed the location and atmosphere. Love Eataly. Service was excellent from the front desk to the Rewards desk and Housekeeping. I really liked the variety of restaurants. I liked that i could walk to Aria or New York New York and only a Tram away from Bellagio. I really like the Smoke free Casino because i get breathing issues being in it to long. Overall I will stay there again.
50,Spent most of the time on the casino floor playing Pai Gow poker. All staff is extremely friendly and helpful. Easy mobile check- notifying us of when our room is available. Restaurant staff is very knowledgeable and courteous and Eataly is the best place to eat.
50,Loved staying at the park Mgm I had a wonderful stay. The staff was wonderful and the room was extremely clean. Mgm always surprises me with their amazing staff and cleanliness. Thank you for being so wonderful.
50,Perfect spot very close to the middle of everything. Super easy to grab an Uber to get anywhere on town. Very helpful staff especially concierge and casino hosts. One minor thing I really liked was the speed of the elevators. Slow elevators can really mess up timing but these were sizzling fast
40,"Park MGM is a first class facility. You check all the boxes. Quality service cleanliness friendly and price.  If I have an issue it is the ""Resort Fee"". Candidly just a money grab. In essence it is an exorbitant price to pay for WiFi as we are there for meetings and use non of the other amenities."
50,Had a great time ! Casino staff was especially helpful and friendly! Steak restaurant was really and so was noodles. Front desk helped with a quick question about the nearest drug at 6 AM. Great stay!
40,The park mgm is a very nice hotel! Excellent staff! The only problem was I had to replace the room key multiple times during our 4 day stay! Eataly had very good food and was a decent price! Would stay here again!
30,Love to stay here but the shower head but the shower head was half clogged. Not sure if I will be coming back. The staff and check in are awesome tho. Self check in with mobile is great when the lobby is full.
50,Hotel has a great walking location to the concerts I attended that weekend. Across the street walking distance. Access to the parking was easy especially with the mgm rewards app. I didn't even need to use check inn at all. Keys were digital.
50,It was overall a great place to stay. Staff was really nice and informative. Rooms were clean and enough space. Best part is the location so close to the T-Mobile arena. MY friends and I were able to walk in heals with no problem...
50,Staff is excellent and environment is smoke free. Restaurants are very good and the rooms are very clean. Close to all properties and within walking distance to Allegiant Field. T-Mobile is located right outside the doors. Great place to stay!
50,We took several days away from home to visit Las Vegas. The Park is well maintained in all aspects. The smoke-free environment is also a plus for non-smokers. The check-in staff and waitresses are all very guest-focused.
50,It is always a pleasure to stay there. Very clean and the staff there are excellent. By far the best value on the strip. Eataly is superb and I enjoy the pools.. Being smoke free makes the casino much more enjoyable to play in.
50,Loved the non smoking casino!!! This was a girl's trip and we even got connecting rooms. Everything was great including food at Primrose and Best Friend. Everyone was friendly and helpful. Wish I had jotted down names of some particularly great people. Will definitely do so next time. Thanks for a wonderful and memorable trip.
30,I Had to go to another Hotel to relax and smoke a cigar if I knew that  I would have stayed at another Hotel so if your a non-smoker this hotel is for you room was nice Breakfast a little expensive two of us cost 80.00 for Eggs and sausage with coffee little much I think
50,Always love this hotel. No smoking smell… great choices of drinks and food… and can’t beat that it’s walkable to T-Mobile and has a great venue inside for shows/ concerts. This hotel has been my “go-to” place when I go to Vegas!
50,I like the hotel but this is the tenth time I have wrote this it keeps clearing it self so everything great with the casino this questionnaire is a pain if this one doesn’t go through I will not try again
40,Love Eately… love the casino… but the pot smoking in the rooms filled up the hallways…. It’s so profound that it can’t be ignored….. which is what the park is doing. Ignoring it. No one from the park would address…..min fact they pretty much ignored it.
50,Perfect place to stay when going to an event at T-Mobile Arena. With the MGM Resorts app I was able to enjoy all of my time without waiting in line to check in. Also the mobile room keys were amazing.
50,We had a wonderful time from start to finish. Friendly helpful efficient service at check in. Room was very nice retro classy style clean and everything we needed. Beds were extremely comfortable. The casino was very welcoming and smoke-free wonderful food options throughout and every single person we dealt with was great. Will definitely be staying here again and recommending to others.
10,The room was dingy. The heater did not work while we were sleeping because you “must be moving around the room” for the heater or AC to work. I can’t imagine the horrible heat I. The summer. There was no refrigerator in the room. There was no coffee pot in the room.
50,Check in was a breeze once I had my room key and got to my room I called the bellhop desk to bring my luggage and that was completed amazingly quickly. The location could not be better and the fact it is 100% nonsmoking will keep us coming back.
50,There is no reason NOT to stay in this hotel. It is just fine in every way. In general it is slightly less luxurious than the other strip hotels (Bellagio Aria Caesar) in terms of things like restaurants pool spa gym rooms but it also was much less expensive! Everything within walking distance. Strip view from the room badly blocked by the Waldorf Astoria but still beautiful. Clean new property. Needs a buffet and some good restaurants. Honestly I would stay again.
50,Never stayed at Park MGM before but it was great! Great location great rooms great casino and hotel overall. We were upgraded to a suite which was more accommodating than we expected or even needed but it was great. I’ll definitely be returning with family the casino is smoke free so even more kid friendly. And there Haus of Gaga is located there!
50,100% Recommended!  I stayed there with my family we had connected rooms and everything was clean and the all the services were just on point. Beds were super comfortable rooms super big and we had great views from each room.
50,This was our second time but longer stay and staff was very nice and accommodating. Was a pleasant experience. Location was great and easy access between park and aria. Easy access to bus stop and crossing bridges
50,I have been staying at this hotel for years and I love it. Location is perfect right in the middle of the strip and I can walk anywhere. The M&M store is across the street and the Aria and New York is right next to it.
40,I enjoyed the more relaxing vibe at the Park MGM. Restaurants are very nice! The Primrose brunch spot was on point I recommend asking for Shelly because I felt like she was attentive with our bottomless mimosa thirst; overall I felt the service there was perfection. CONS: The rooms have a shared closet/bathroom door and no mini fridge :(
50,Very nice and perfect location. We got this hotel because olee were going to 2 concerts at the T-Mobile arena and it was a 2 minute walk from the arena to this hotel. It was very clean and friendly staff
50,Lovely hotel and great casino. The staff was friendly and the atmosphere was great! I got a free comp night because of my previous stay decided to go with Park MGM and was not disappointed! Hotel had a great staff and daily room service was very convenient
50,Great stay at the only non smoking casino in Vegas. Only reason we left the hotel was to go to Santana and Styx. The casino is smaller than many but that is what makes it great for us. Best Friend is an awesome restaurant.
50,Service was all right your housekeeping stole a Watch from us it was there when we left and we came back it was gone and we called the front desk they said they would have to call security so we called security guy blatantly told me what do you want me to do that’s pretty sad.
50,We had an amazing time. We were attending a concert at T-Mobile Arena and Park MGM is literally across the street! Restaurants were amazing Casino was clean Club was so much fun. We will definitely stay here again.
50,I love this hotel/casino! It has everything you need (except for a live poker room): SMOKELESS HOTEL great restaurants nice casino good pool area and at a great value rate. It is connected by walkway to ARIA and by a tram to Bellagio which gives you access to two other world class casinos. I love the Primrose restaurant for breakfast or lunch and Bavette's Steakhouse is as good as any steakhouse in town. And the rates are half to two-thirds of ARIA and Bellagio!
50,The rooms were very clean and tidy. The property as a whole is easy to navigate and most importantly smoke free! Great location nice amenities! This is my favorite property to stay at when I travel to Vegas for work.
50,This hotel is beautiful! Check in was easy and the front desk was awesome! My stay got extended by two extra days due to a snow storm on the East Coast and the front desk did an excellent job of accommodating me so I didn't have to lug my luggage around while waiting check check out time to check in time. The shower water pressure is amazing lots of places to eat and drink. I only wish the pool was open later and that there was a mini fridge. I would definitely stay again.
50,Friendly staff great casino close to other attractions. One of the only resorts with a pool open during the winter months. Check in was a breeze. Partners inside the resort were convenient and provided great options
50,Stayed at this Hotel celebrating a birthday with family. The staff was friendly and very helpful from the front desk to housekeeping. Great location with Target ABC store for souvenirs Denny’s and an Outback Restaurants across the street.  Great Places to eat inside as well 3 pools.(too cold to go in on our visit)  Gambling wasn’t too bad some of our group won nice jackpots.  Would definitely stay there again.
50,Nice Hotel and very conveniently located across from Tmobile center for events!! and in the heart of the Las Vegas strip. Concierge Staff and Valet staff were very cordial and helpful with a friendly smile. Staff on the casino gaming floor were also very nice.
30,Vip desk needs to do bettet at providing solutions instead of just telling you it is what it and there is nothing they can do about about finding a solution to your problem and send you on your way to find ot on your own.
50,Good clean and nice hotel.  The view was nice. It was my first time  Staying there and I liked it. The room is small but comfy.  The restroom clean the showers 🚿 heaven water was warm.  I would stay again here
50,We had a great time. The mask police weren’t overly aggressive which was very nice! The room was clean. Great location within walking distance of most places along the strip. We would gladly stay here again and recommend it to our friends. The smoke free casino was great.
30,Because we used a 3 party i could not get no service  like internet  food service . and there was no coffee  or ice box in the room  and we had a nighthawk suite  the 2 tv were so close you could not watch one show with been side track by the other tv
40,I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at the Park MGM. The location is quite good and the strip view was wonderful. Amenities within the hotel are top notch. However the amenities within the rooms are fairly standard. Very good overall and would recommend for all types of guests.
10,Most hotels resorts and casinos do not charge your card upfront.. They also charged $200.00 additional hold on your card and full amount is charged at the park upon check in.. that’s rediculous and they also won’t give u $200 back until 14 days after checkout. I won’t be staying here again.
40,The location was great. Room was super clean. All the amenities. Everything was super close by. Rooms do not have a mini fridge which is odd for it being in Vegas. Super convenient for my trip since I went to the TMobile arena literally across the street.
50,The Park MGM is an amazing place. used to stay strictly at the Mandaly but after my last time there it was a horrible experience. Decided to try The Park and it is now my go to place. love that it is all non smoking
50,I really like how clean the casino and hotel are. No smoking anywhere in hotel/casino which I like. Very friendly staff. It has some of my favorite restaurants and Eatly is its own unique experience.
10,Dealers will do things to hurt your play. No one was winning even with slots and black jack along with craps. Room was not as clean as it should be especially during these times with covid. Restaurants were limited hours of operation made for frustration.
50,"This hotel provides serenity in the heart of the Las Vegas Strip. The recently (2018-2019) renovated hotel has a nature theme and is beautifully appointed. The rooms are decorated simply with a quirky modern ""lodge"" feel. Convenient to the Arena and many local off-site restaurants. Their garage is well lit and has round the clock security. Moderately priced compared to other MGM properties."
10,Talked to 2 staff members at different places and No one at the hotel gave me correct information. I was left with an extra charge on my bill at checkout. I called in to see what they can help with and was transferred and left with no help.
40,Overall I love this place for the value the no-smoking policy and the Eataly food court. However we had a terrible time sleeping due to abnormally loud music blasting outside our window near the T-Mobile Arena. I wish someone would coordinate with the food trucks/plaza people to monitor the sound levels so that people can sleep (it was blasting at 7AM).
30,Wasn’t the greatest suite. I rented it for my birthday thinking it was going to be big enough to entertain but it seemed small and very old - seemed very much like Monte Carlo still. Not sure if I’ll be back to stay
50,Loved it here the staff and food were delicious. The location was awesome and the rooms were always clean. The tiramisu in Eatly wow amazing ! The smoke free place made it very good to enjoy the smell everywhere.
50,I really enjoyed my stay here. The staff was extremely friendly and the casino is smoke free which is great for someone like me who has asthma and don’t like the smell of smoke. The restaurants were nice the food was delicious and the location is great.
10,Over priced high resort fees and daily parking fees. Wet dew restaurant and bar options. Over priced cocktails. ?22.99 for two draft beers served in onastic cups. The sheets and pillows were not comfortable. Would not recommend d this property to my family and friends.
50,Good quality rooms. The room are good value for your money and are clean. Good places to dine in as well. Good amount of slot machines. The marketing team helped with resort fees which was really helpful.
50,Location of the hotel was phenomenal! Friendliness at the hotel was exceptional. Eataly has great food and a variety of options that I never felt a need to go/visit another eatery. It’s a perfect quaint unpretentious and centralized hotel on the strip.
50,We always enjoy coming to the Park MGM and the Nomad so we brought friends along so they could experience the friendliness the service the food and the fun. The rooms are clean and quiet. The food was amazing!
50,Great experience everything was fast and efficient from check in to check out. The only thing that I could say was not Great was the traffic from the T Mobile arena but we were still able to get parking so even that wasn't so bad. Definitely staying here again.
40,Very clean room and the location is excellent. On the strip right away after exiting Eataly Las Vegas version of Italy dining experience. Nice price on the room but no microwave or fridge. They should mention that during the booking process.
50,Wonderful work trip turn play!!! Had a great time with friends! We loved the staff and service! And the fact they don’t allow smoking inside is priceless for me! The air was fresh and our overall experience was wonderful!
40,The Park is fairly new use to be The Monte Carlo. Next to the Arena and The New York New York Casino. Inside casino very nice and clean. The rooms are very nice. I stayed for three days never seen house keeping. They are very big on the COVID (which is a good thing). Very helpful people here the only thing was I never seen people winning. Stan
50,We had a great time at MGM Park. Staff is nice. Rooms were only ok but who stays in the room when you are in Vegas? If you are a light sleeper make sure your room doesn't face T-Mobile arena They apparently pipe in music to the area in front of the arena all night long. My wife wanted a room change and they accommodated us without question. Casino was nice and Eataly was fantastic. I will definitely make this a favorite place on the strip.
50,My family and I had a great time. Smoke free casino is the best. The tram makes it easy to access near by hotels. And theres several restaurant's near by. Everything within walking distance. Great time
40,If you’re tired of smelling like smoke after you visit a place you can be rest assured you will enjoy yourself here. They have room service and a Starbucks in the lobby. They do not have a coffee maker in the room. They don’t have a dresser in the hotel so if you’re staying for one day it shouldn’t be a problem. They have a few drawers tucked in the closet with very few areas to place things on top of. The Primrose Café for breakfast was good and reasonably priced but the juices at seven dollars a glass was a bit much. I ordered orange and cranberry and it should’ve been priced at three or four dollars not seven.
10,Carpet damp stained towels toilet seat broken and not clean yellow at the back hair on blanket. It wasn’t worth the money I paid. I definitely can’t send a client there to stay. I was very disappointed
40,We just spent two nights here. The location is very convenient staff is helpful and there are some good restaurants and bars. The pools are very nice. The rooms are fairly large and well appointed. The bathrooms are a nice size and light.
50,This is the only non-smoking hotel on the strip and is very clean compared to MGM Grand and NYNY next door. The location is perfect right next to Aria and Cosmopolitan and is an easy 10-min walk to Planet Hollywood or Bellagio. The self parking lot is clean and easily accessible from the ground or casino. This is the only hotel we’ll stay at from now on because of how clean it was and the fact that you don’t have to breathe 2nd hand smoke and leave smelling like an ash tray. Also the casino wasn’t very busy (January 2022) and the free drinks were great - I had the Cabernet Sauvignon and I could tell it was a good quality wine and not just Barefoot or Woodbridge cheap wine that everyone else serves. 10/10 would recommend.
50,Within walking distance to T-Mobile Area and great rooms for the price. Love the Eataly as a place to grab a quick snack coffee or drink. Also if you want to do some shopping or have a change of scenery (or luck) there is an indoor walkway between Park MGM and Aria. Overall had a great stay and will return.
50,I must say it feels like a high end hotel with all the features but still has the gaming options. Just an awesome property. I will definitely come back. The view of the T-mobile stadium was a plus too.
40,Incredible visit to MGM Park Las Vegas this was a business trip that just happened to have my birthday within that same week the ability to be able to enjoy all of the entertainment of Vegas and still get all of the business done with being in a great location it was able to get back and forth to our business conference locations overall a great experience and an amazing trip thank you so much Las Vegas and especially Park MGM
40,I stayed at the park MGM for 2 nights for a family and business stay and I must say everything was exceptional on this visit would have to say this was the first visit I actually had fun the last 2 visits to vegas were not great at all but this visit was awesome the customer service and guest check in and cocktail waitress services were excellent at the park MGM the room was nice had a good strip view the gaming was fun for the first time on the strip considering everytime I went to gamble on the strip prior was an epic fail i did manage to break even this time with a small loss but that's the reality of gambling would hope to win a hand pay one day for the first time ever on the strip overall park MGM was great and a good choice to stay at.
50,Had a great time at this smoke free hotel and casino! Great food and service at primrose! Must try the cannolis in Eataly! Rooms are comfortable quite and the shower is amazing. Hats off to the staff at the Park MGM! Will be back for sure!!
40,Room and staff were great. Room location  was not good. Loud music from t-mobile arena ALL night. I stayed for my birthday weekend and got next to no sleep. Really need to consider contacting t-mobile arena to eliminate music during nighttime hours
30,There are way better options on the strip. I’ve heard good things about Park but wasn’t amazed by the property or rooms. Also there was weird stains on our wall and one lamp shade that almost looked like blood so most likely won’t stay here again.
40,Clean simple room and smoke free. Great value and we would stay again. Location on the strip was perfect to do many things. Parking was simple with signage. Eataly food court is wonderful quality bit $$$ for non-resturaunt.
50,Came to Vegas for fun. One of my favorite hotels and casinos. Super affordable and great quality stay for the price. Friendly staff and super clean rooms. Everything went super smooth. Would come back again.
40,Everything was great we did not get a chance to see the show which was fine only thing I’m very very upset with was the price of parking each day while staying I’m born and raise Vegas so it’s very hard to wrap my mind around paying for parking then I was charged $30 for valet even though I was staying in the hotel
40,Traveled to Las Vegas for a special birthday. Room was nice with a good view of the strip. Close to airport. Easy access to entertainment other hotels restaurants bars bus. Staff is very friendly and helpful.
50,Great location to other MGM properties. Clean rooms friendly staff.....Eataly is a definite if you like Italian food or even if you don't. Very impressed with the quality of food. Highly recommend Park MGM.
50,Excellent stay. Staff was amazing. Casino was very nice and clean. The room was clean and had plenty of room for us and our daughter. All around an excellent value for the price. We will be staying again.
40,I agree with the reviews. Hotel has a good vibe. I think the rooms might be smaller. My 1st room did not have a tub so I think they might have been removed it to make space. The resort fee is the only thing that will keep me away. Only I can see is the gym benefit for $42.00 per day.
50,This was my 3rd stay at Park MGM and it was just as nice as the 2 before. I enjoyed all 3 hotel stays and will certainly let stay again for my next market visit. When visiting during the warmer months the pool area was so inviting!!!!
50,Easy self check in and check out. Clean rooms smoke free casino was amazing best on the strip. Great food and very accessible to anywhere you want to go. The staff was very polite and courteous. Ate at Best Friends and Primerose in the lobby both tasty and amazing.
30,No coffee pot or fridge in the room. I couldn’t take my leftovers to warm them up :/ other than that it was okay. I liked that we were across the street from the Hello Kitty Cafe. Don’t think I would stay there again.
40,The perfect description for this resort was definitely Goldilocks! Not too big not too small but just right. It was my first time staying at the Park MGM and it didn’t take me very long to get my bearings. Hopefully I can come back too stay and watch the Wild beat the Golden Knights next door.
50,We took a group of friends for my wife's birthday and we had an amazing experience at Park MGM. We will definitely stay again soon. We loved the non-smoking aspect of the hotel as well as the cool little eating area at the front of the hotel. It was close to the arena and the rideshare area was conveniently located for ease of access.
50,I had the best time at Park MGM. This was one of the few stays at any Las Vegas property during which I had not one complaint. The staff members were friendly and professional. I feel they went above and beyond to make sure I enjoyed my stay. The property is right in the middle of everything. There is even a 24-hour CVS within walking distance. Contactless check-in and check-out options were great. I likely return to Park MGM later on this year.
50,Our sales team stayed here on our annual visit to LV for a tradeshow that typically takes place in late January / early February. The difference PARK MGM makes in that it is smoke free is amazing compared to other hotels I have stayed at in the past. My eyes stayed red-free and my voice was in tact after 5 days thanks to no smoke. Clean and easy to use this hotel is a fine and affordable option for even the most discerning customer. Eataly is blast!
50,We celebrated the big 21st birthday in Las Vegas. Great service and dining. Nice rooms a lot of employees on staff to assist your every need. The hotel was full due to events but we were able to enjoy great meals and gaming.
50,The hotel was very clean The casino is awesome because of non smoking is our preference. I would recommend this Hotel for following safety protocols with Covid. We never felt worried about Covid. Because the machine are clean and spread out. The food court has good food. Our only issues is it’s all Italian food. It’s good but would like more variety.  Overall the MGM Grand is a very nice place to be on the Las Vegas strip. Very close to many awesome hotel.
50,It was a great stay I love the food options in the hotel. The bakery its a must try also breakfast at the hotel restaurant in the lobby. They have to many options you really dont need to leave the hotel if you do not want to. Eataly is a must try def!!!!
50,Park MGM is smoke free clean and easy to find your way around. It’s also located in a great spot on the strip. Closest to T Mobile Arena. The food choices are really great too. My favorite is Eataly.
20,Outdated room. not even a clock on the nightstand. When we requested a mini fridge we were told it'd be an additional $35 dollars a night! Housekeeping staff was nice. Eataly food wasn't edible. 2 drinks and 2 meals $85. Carpets in the halls were dirty. Paper thin motel type walls.
50,I stay at Park MGM often and have not been disappointed. The hotel is clean and in the middle of the strip with close access to all the other main hotels. Rooms are nice and beds are comfy. Already booked my NYE 2022 stay!!!
10,front desk worker told me “rooms are requested not guaranteed” when i asked why the room i booked for over a month in advance was “sold out” of upon checking in. highly dissatisfied with my stay. would not recommend
50,Enjoyed our stay with friends. We were able to get our rooms at a great price. The rooms were nice and clean. We slept comfortably. The staff was helpful at check-in and we will definitely be returning soon.
40,We loved being in a non-smoking casino and hotel. The staff were good. There are a lot of food choices at the hotel. The location is good. You can grab the tram across the way at the MGM which is very helpful if going down towards the Venetian. Rooms in the wing by the arena are loud as music plays outside all night long (wing with rooms in the 300s).
50,This was my second time to this particular hotel and was satisfied in every aspect. Easy to access clean smoke free for my pregnant girlfriend and unlike other places it doesnt take long to get access to the elevator.
50,The enjoyed my stay. I stayed in a suite and found the very spacious. There was a long ‘L’ shaped couch in the living area with a separate room with a king size bed. The bed was extremely comfortable too. The shower was my favorite feature. Plenty of room and excellent water pressure.
40,I arrived at the hotel at 8pm and check in was quick and easy. After putting bag in room I went for something to eat. Casino floor was very busy grabbed some chicken tenders at the sports bar.  Room was clean with a wall length couch a dining table and a couple of chairs.  Various eateries and I can recommend 'best friends' the Korean bbq place. Mobile checkout was easy
50,Nice place to stay. Close to shopping and food. T-Mobile arena next door. The room was spacious. Also had a couch which was nice. Our room faced the strip so we could look out. The strip view never interfered with us sleeping at night.
30,The best thing about Park MGM is the location on the Strip and the fact that the entire facility is Smoke Free. Lots of food choices with Eataly La La Noodle Bavettes but nothings open past 10pm. Rooms need updating looks like they partially tried but did it on the cheap.
50,I had a good stay at the hotel. Everything was clean and in good condition. The lobby is nice and the staff are friendly. The room just seemed to be lacking the Wow factor that many other hotels on the strip have. Not unhappy with the room though. Again it was clean and comfortable. And I have to note that the water pressure in the shower is much better than other hotels I have stayed at on the strip. A pleasant surprise.
40,Price was decent. Room was not what I consider a suite since it was just one large room with beds couch and table. Only thing was everything was extra ie not included in the room rate. We paid extra for a fridge if we wanted a coffee pot that was extra. A third person would have been extra. The room was nice staff was excellent. and the beds were comfy. Very clean casino.
40,My stay at park MGM. Was good. Very clean short walk from parking structure to casino. Good views from the hotel room. Close to other casinos and places to eat. I will stay again there in the future.
50,King room has no microwave or fridge and the bed and pillows were not the comfiest but who is ever in Vegas to get a good nights sleep? Overall the hotel is super nice and clean. There is also a tram that connects to the Aria and Vdara and the crystal shops in between!
50,Great experience. Team was amazing at reception and accomodations were made on my behalf for a few minor inconveniences like not having a King size bed for me as I paid for the lady helped me sort through. A free night would have been amazing though! anyways great team there stayed there often.
30,Hotel was fine but I was expecting a bigger upgrade from when it was the Monte Carlo. Nice new strip entrance but inside it felt like it was a fresh coat of paint for the Monte Carlo. Rooms were a bit small and not well appointed. Food at Eatery over-priced and mediocre quality which was disappointing.
50,Always a great stay mobile check-in was great but the digital key only worked 10% of the time which required a physical key and defeated the purpose of the mobile check-in. Other than that everything else was 10/10
50,Decor could use some updating for sure very friendly and helpful staff good location and no smoking allowed a HUGE plus! All you need on location food convenience store casino etc. Eataly is everything Italian you could want for a bite to eat!!
40,it was a great value and good experience.  Nothing exceptional but then again it's not supposed to be.  bed was very comfortable and the room was clean.  i didn't find the glasses until the last day because they were in the closet.  Basics were covered but the amenities were few
30,The room never cooled down was too hot no mini fridge and got bit by something in the night and could feel a hard object under the carpet that hurt my foot. Overall the rooms are meh much better experience at the Luxor but the smoke free is a large benefit.
30,The room was not as clean as it could of been. They didn’t have a fridge in the room besides the mini bar. They charged us for putting our drinks on the fridge. Went downstairs to discuss the charge and didn’t seem interested and said it was taken care of but then showed on my credit card.
30,"My girlfriends and I stayed here in December because we were excited to try out the rebrand of this property. The main grounds are incredible. Eataly Best Friend Juniper Lounge were all stand outs! The free Lady Gaga costume display was fun. Very hip and trendy hotel. But the rooms were so incredibly lackluster that it felt like they ran out of money when they refurbished this hotel by the time they got to the hotel rooms. Small rooms horrible lighting fuzzy windows that were hard to see out of and paper thin walls made this a one-and-done hotel for our group. We also were ""upgraded"" to the Stay Well rooms and I would tell you not to waste your money on these amenities. They were laughable. Some worked most didn't. We visit twice a year to Vegas and we've stayed just about everywhere. We were hoping for more with Park MGM."
50,MGM Park is a very nice casino. When we arrived the bel  l person was very helpful . He gave suggestions where to get breakfast until our room was ready. Once we got into our room it took no time for our luggage to arrive. The staff was very friendly and it is a smoke free environment .
40,Eataly restaurant and Starbucks inside the casino clear and safe uber/ lyft/ride share area walking distance to Excalibur which is pick-up and drop-off location for many tour and excursions A cheaper food court right across the street
50,This location has awesome views it is right in the middle of all the action on the Strip. There are many restaurants to choose from and the casinos are great. There is also a nightclub that is pretty fun as well.
40,Great location on the strip which provides plenty of variety in dining options without having to walk too far. Rooms are a little small but adequate. Be aware of rooms facing the Arena music plays all night long.
40,We went for pre birthday couple getaway. Encountered a few minor problems with digital  Room key not working and having to change rooms but staff was very friendly and accommodating and we were comp’d for the inconvenience. Would have given a higher rating but we got sick after eating room service twice! Thought it was covid or virus related but we tested negative for everything as soon as we left-room service food was only culprit left. Would definitely stay again-great location clean rooms friendly staff. Not the loosest slots but still had fun. If it weren’t for the room service food I would give it 5! Completely smoke free was great and we smoke! Designated smoking areas clean and convenient. Give it a try you won’t be disappointed-just don’t order room service until they address food issues.
40,We took a nice trip to the MGM Park a non-smoking hotel and casino. It is a lovely place can't say enough about having a non-smoking casino option. We enjoyed our stay no smoking meant no people smoking weed in the hotel as well which has become a huge problem. It was nice not to deal with these issues. Will go back again.
40,GREAT NO SMOKING hotel the only place to stay!! The only problems we had were no room service after 2 pm and no coffee machine in the room. Don't let the cheap rooms fool you they make it up on the food prices!
50,Love that the entire building is smoke free. Ate at Primrose a couple of mornings for breakfast- delicious! Also at a couple of time in the Eataly area- also delicious. The rooms are comfortable and modern.
50,stay was great no complaints great view would 100% stay here again i liked the location and parking walk around was the only problem i thought i’d have but they had plenty of signs everywhere pointing for directions it was great
50,This was our first stay at Park MGM. Wonderful experience. From check-in to check-out the service was great. Very friendly staff spacious comfortable room and super casino. The location provided easy access to the Strip and it’s many venues. Plan to make this a go to hotel in the future.
50,"This hotel is centrally located and it has a very clean and easy to navigate casino. There could be better advertising for its restaurants but it does have an ""Eat-aly"" restaurant / food court that is upscale Italian and a wonderful contribution from Lidia Bastianich."
50,So much fun clean and great restaurants. We kept going back to Eataly the Italian marketplace downstairs. Delicous wine espresso bakery and everything else! Can't wait to go back.    Casino floor is non-smoking which is great to walk up and down a strip casino without the smell of smoke
50,Staff for super friendly And very helpful. The rooms were clean and comfortable the hotel was quiet and calm and very clean. I would definitely stay there again because of how less crowded and how serious they took the cleanliness during Covid
50,We had the best time at The Park MGM. We were there for a surprise birthday! I loved the atmosphere (non smoking too!) the fact that we could get around so easily using the tram and Uber! Great experience! We will be back!
40,Came for a hockey game. Hotel right across the street from the arena. Room was clean and large lots of places to eat. Friendly staff. Enjoyed the sportsbook except for the loud music in the evening after the football games.
50,Everybody’s very friendly and if you need help they can help you ask for anything if they don’t know they tell you how or where to go they are nice I love this hotel is my favorite. Plus is very well located.
30,A good location on the strip - but so close to the arena means they now add daily parking fee - on top of resort fee. And for the prices they charge for daily resort fee (wi-fi etc) it should be a secure network for checking emails etc.
50,Great location not crowded like MGM Grand; people were nice and friendly bar in Casino was good but gambling was a disappointment. Table staff could have been more supportive and could have educated first time gamblers (my son who's Bday it was) better.
50,I was a bit apprehensive booking here  I was looking to book mgm tower but I couldn't get in for 5 consecutive days  so they were able to get me in here.It was Great very nice clean  and convenient to everything. Thanks for having me  I am looking forward to coming back.
50,This was an amazing place. Reasonably priced great staff great location and great property. I think that the rooms should be a little cooler but other than that it was very comfortable for my wife and I.
30,I have stayed at a number of properties on the strip. The room itself in the Park isn't great. The walls are thin and the wifi is extremely unstable to the point there are dead spots and you'll have to resign in repeatedly. We could hear the people in the neighboring room constantly during our trip. If this was a discount hotel I'd understand and although it's not the most expensive stay on the strip over $700 for 4 days (Not including resort fees) isn't discount either. We opted for this hotel since we mainly went to watch the VGK Penguins game and the location of the hotel for that purpose is spectacular! The staff was amazing and the casino is good. All that being said my wife and I have decided we won't be staying here again.
50,We enjoyed our stay here. 2nd time I've been to the Park MGM. Plenty of restaurants and entertainment within walking distance. Super clean and No Smoking was a big plus. Only thing I would have preferred is a little lower minimums at the craps and blackjack tables. $25 min was steep for me!
40,Nice central location right off the Strip across from the Aria and NY/NY. Relatively smaller & calmer compared to giant beehives like Caesar's & The Venetian and if you want it even quieter and classier stay on the isolated NoMad floors with adjoining lobby & bar. By far the best asset however is the presence of Eataly occupying half of the ground floor otherwise occupied by the casino. Makes it ideal for grabbing dinner whether you are with a group couple or travelling alone as there are several dining choices representing a variety of Italian foods and seating options.
40,I was visiting Las Vegas with some family members. All of the staff were nice friendly and helpful. I had to have my room switch to another room because the strip side music was just too loud for me. Overall my stay was great the rooms were clean and I will stay there again.
40,Park MGM is one of our favorite hotels because of the location smoke free hotel and pretty clean most of the time we are there. Staffs are friendly and knowledgeable. The only issue we have was the beds were not comfortable. We got back pain and didn’t have good sleep during our stay. Hope they some how upgrades the mattress quality.
50,Very clean and quiet for the most part. People with kids showed up on the weekend. Nice non-smoking gaming floor too. The rooms all seemed to have connected doors I didn’t like that. The HAUS of Gaga was cool
30,Room was clean and nice. The Italian food court area is very nice. Service on the casino was poor at times it would take close to an hour to get a drink… check in and check out was very good…. No wait and professional….
50,We had a great stay at the Park MGM. The casino was fun clean and had awesome game selection! Our room was very comfortable with a beautiful view of the strip. We will definitely continue to stay here!
50,Room was nice and clean! Our room request to be a little close to the elevator was fulfilled. A plus to be at a non smoking casino. Casino has all the amenities we needed including a nice bar (on the record) which they played 80s and 90s music.
40,Hotel is in a great location. The free tram was very handy and convenient. We felt very safe in the hotel. It was very clean and aesthetically pleasing. Housekeeping did an excellent job. Eataly was great. The smoke-free casino was the cherry on top.
50,The park MGM was a very nice place to stay. Very friendly and professional staff. Very clean. Fun casino to play at anice variety of gaming machines. I would highly recommend this hotel and casino to stay at.
20,This is a pig with bad lipstick on it. The rooms are dark and dingy. The ceilings are super low and the elevators require a key card to get to your floor. This is a pain in the butt when you have friends on different floors. They also make the gaming tables bad odds. There are three greens on roulette black Jack does not pay the traditional 1.5 times and the crapless craps don’t pay the normal odds.
50,Truly special property if you are looking for somewhere away from the fray. Very quiet with access to excitement as you want it. Great food options and super staff service. Good location with access to the tram through aria.
50,Good experience at the Park MGM will definitely stay again. Just wished there was more options for food for late hours 12am-2am. I will always recommend family and friends to stay here at the Park MGM it's also close to everything walking distance to bars and strip.
40,I’ve stayed at this hotel 3x’s now. We typically travel with our dogs. This place is pet friendly. They have a designated pet station. That’s very helpful!    As for the rooms: They’re nice. Clean. Very comfortable bedding. I’ve always been pleased with my room.    The last stay I had issues with the A/C. It was still technically working so I didn’t call the hotel or inform them because I didn’t want to bother with waiting on maintenance.    My previous stays I was very happy with the staff during check in. This time it was done through the MGM app. Very easy but that means I didn’t interact with the staff.
40,We came to Vegas for a youth soccer tournament. The Park MGM was in a great location. Staff was friendly and the rooms were clean. There was no complimentary coffee maker in the room which was disappointing but other than that I would stay again. Enjoyed the App which allowed us to check in and out keep updated on charges and had our self-park pass on it. This made everything a breeze.
40,MGM did a great job of remodeling the old Monte Carlo. Rooms were clean and beds were comfortable. More than enough room in the bathroom. Loved the non-smoking aspect. All the staff was very helpful and friendly.
50,Really enjoyed the smoke free casino. Friendly staff and excellent service. The hotel is very conveniently located in the middle of the strip so I found it very easy to walk to many other attractions. Easy self check in and free parking with Mlife Rewards.
50,We stayed at the Park MGM in January. Our room was awesome. It was very clean and the view was great. The tram from Park MGM to Bellagio was so nice. Restaurants were a bit pricey.Will definitely stay here again.
50,This was our first stay at the Park MGM. The location is awesome the rooms are beautiful and clean. The restaurant options are great the the slot machines were a blast. It's a great location if you're going to football or hockey games!
20,We booked a Nightingale Strip View Suite at the Park.  When we walked into the room it looked like something I would expect at a Red Roof or an Econolodge not at a Vegas property like the Park.  The furnishings were run down there were water stains on the ceiling the lamp shades at the bedside were falling a part and there appeared to be a larger picture missing off the wall. I assue this because there were two large brackets sticking out of the wall with their screws partiall pulled from the wall and a pile of drywall on the floor below them. I think they may have been going for some kind of Retro-Chic look with the red accent walls red velvet window seating area and brown/green carpets... but it just looked cheap. I spoke to the front desk about my disappointment in the room and their solution was to give me a single $50 food voucher.
40,This whole surrounding and entrance area has been redeveloped now that the arena is close by the casino is pretty much the same from the previous Monte Carlo.  I wish they would reconsider the name though as its too close to MGM Grand.
50,The hotel staff made this trip so comfortable I felt I was at home! The security house cleaning bell and front desk waitress and all the other hotel staff was so friendly and helpful! that I felt secured and safe. I would highly recommend this hotel as one of the Best and Safest hotel!
50,I enjoyed my recent stay. The hotel was clean always being attended to by janitorial staff. It smelled clean which is huge during this Covid-19 pandemic. I love the fact that the casino is smoke free which to me draws a different crowd. The people there were friendly fun and kind. The On the Record club was so much fun great music and I loved the dancers. The hotel is located right in the heart of the strip conveniently located to almost everything on the strip.
10,I wanted to at least give this hotel a two star but the level of service that we received was unacceptable. The first room had a foul odor and visible stains on both double bedding. The staff transferred us to another room; however it didn’t rectify the disgust and disappointment from the first room. When I followed up with the receptionist at checkout she didn’t seem concerned. In fact she didn’t apologize and did not further inquire about my complaint. She insisted on charging a resort fee and made me fill out an incidental form regarding a snack that I did not remove.
50,The stay was great! Room was clean and with a great view of the pools. The location cannot be beat! It was perfectly located in the middle of the strip. I will definitely book here again. It was a perfect weekend gateway.
50,Park MGM is the best! The location is the first thing you notice but not only is this hotel in the best location on the Strip it also is smoke free! The staff are friendly professional and helpful the facility is easy to access easy to navigate in addition to being clean bright and well laid-out. I particularly appreciated the ease of getting picked up and dropped off by Uber/Lyft/taxi out of the traffic flow of guests checking in. Thank you for giving everyone exactly what was needed for our grown-up family trip!
10,Horrible hotel very depressing the design is horrible the window is tiny the colors are too dark. They placed us on a floor where there seemed to be a children soccer tournament teams on as well and kids were slamming doors and screaming and running all weekend
50,Staying here over the holidays seemed a bit odd to me at first but it turned out to be a great experience. The location is fantastic! And the room was beautiful and well appointed (Nighthawk Suite). Check-in was easy and seamless via the MGM app where you can access your room keys and room pholio on the fly. The restaurant scene here is great with Primrose Best Friend and Eataly anchoring down the various dinning experiences. As an aside most MGM properties seem to be located in close proximity to one another and easily accessed via pedestrian bridges and walkways with the Mirage being the only exception. If you're looking for a nice clean resort and casino you really cant go wrong with Park MGM. There are too many positives with this property to list so do yourself a favor and check out a place you might have over looked.
40,This was a great hotel good location the only issue I had was I wished it had a refrigerator in the room. It is right next to New York New York so you can go to the park MGM restaurants or you can go to New York New York both have great food
30,Complained about a stained couch response was more or less too bad when calling up to request a room relocation. Called and asked how much the room water was and was told $20 per bottle this seems to be very high
40,We loved our stay at the Park aside from the lack of amenities in the hotel room especially for the price ($219/night). Note that there is not a fridge in the room nor is there a coffee maker. They provide shampoo and conditioner but only one bar of soap which was needed for the sink but we were able to get a second for the shower upon request.    Great pillows though! And the bench seat was a nice touch to watch the strip.
50,The check-in process was wonderfully easy using the MGM app. We walked in and went straight to our room which was spacious and comfortable.  Non-smoking made the already nice atmosphere even better. It was very clean everywhere.  Every staff member we came in contact with was friendly and helpful.  It was ideally located on the strip with the free tram to Bellagio practically outside the door.  Would definitely like to stay here again.
40,My stay at Park MGM was excellent. The location and the cleanliness of the room were excellent. It was near many great places to eat. Furthermore all the staff were friendly and approachable. I was very pleased that it is a no smoking property. I had a great time at Park MGM.
50,I wanted to offer a huge thank you and shout out to Hank Graae. His guidance on meals and places to drink on site were awesome and led to us discovering some beautiful amenities at the Park MGM.  Appreciate Hank going way above his job description as a security guard and offering us some exemplary customer service.
40,We didn't care to much for the red accents in our room but the blue and green accents in the other rooms were pretty. The white tile on the bathroom floor was not a good choice.... don't wear your shoes into the bathroom.
40,It was nice and clean rooms were good.  My only complaints are there's no coffee  maker/supplies in the rooms We only had four coat hangers and probably should have eight to 10 and the hours at the outdoor spa were the same as the pool hours which is not appropriate and it closed at 4pm!!! Spa should be open much longer!!
20,Was given a room that had people in it. They had a broken escalator that made it really hard to navigate with luggage. Was offered some comps that was never applied more just word of mouth to make a person feel good to not burst out with anger.
50,One of the best hotels on the strip. Nice fresh updated hotel very clean staff is friendly and go the extra mile. The Eataly food court provides amazing food in a casual upscale atmosphere. Would hghly recommend to anyone traveling to Las Vegas.
50,Very pleased with location of the resort friendly staff clean rooms easy check in and was a safe environment will be staying here again in the future my girlfriend and I really enjoyed or stay thank you
50,Love coming to park mgm 3rd time around. I will come back and stay there. Love there Mlife rewards. Fast around drinks tight and clean. Quiet room for the little time i sleep..lol kids friendly resort
40,First stay back in 2 years due to the pandemic. As always the location is good. Rooms are noisy so use ear plugs if that's an issue for you. Room wasn't the cleanest and we had to make a note with housekeeping as when we checked in there was long black hair all over the bathroom. yuck. They did clean it well after that. Disappointing thing about this hotel and anything really nearby is that there isn't any really quick food. Years ago when it was the Monte Carlo there was a McDonald's on the main floor. I'm telling you that after a long night sometimes all you want is a $2 cheeseburger and not a $30 piece of pizza (which is what we ended up getting from Eataly). Also nothing really like that around except for the food court next to MGM Grand which is sketchy as heck and not a place you want to be at night.    But overall the best part of this casino is that it is smoke free and we really spent the majority of our time in this casino simply because we could breathe. It's hard enough wearing a mask all the time but couple that with severe smoke inhalation and that's just too hard on the body. As well we had fantastic service with the waitresses.    Slots are tight but I still can't wait to return to Vegas!
50,We stayed here mostly because we were going to the Leafs Knights game and wanted to stay close to the arena. Once we checked in we came to realize the Park was a great casino to stay at. Great mix of slots and tables and also has a non-smoking policy which we loved. Will definitely stay here again in the future.
50,We knew the rooms were smoke free. Didn't realize the casino was too. Could use more late night food options or really ANY late food options. We had a late check in and no food available at 11pm in a hotel with several restaurants. Disappointing start but everything else was great.
20,I think my reviews summed it up for the most part. I’d only add it was more disappointing that I use the sports bet app and have the account basic or something but I didn’t know how to get some sort of points or something to the account. I attempted to ask at check in but the registrar wasn’t really following what I was asking. Just really a disappointing experience for my daughter and I while traveling through Vegas. Disappointing really….
50,Major upgrades from old Monte Carlo. Probably best shower i have ever had. Make sure to ask for room NOT facing T-Mobile arena very loud throughout the night. Staff were all great and helpful. I was disappointed had to pay for parking (didn't before) Eataly was very impressive Expensive as was everything in Vegas nowadays.
40,We enjoyed our two night stay here in a nighthawk suite. Love the mobile checkin and digital room  Key never had an issue. Smoke free casino has a lot of nice machines and great drink service at slots. I do wish there was more video poker.
50,I truly enjoyed my stay from the calming wellness room accomodations to the great central Strip location. There are numerous exciting food options nearby. The Eataly wine bar also has a $10 wine flight happy hour that was an added bonus.
40,I really enjoyed my stay. Clean nice hotel overall. Great restaurants. My one big gripe is room service is very limited. Limited hours (7am-10pm) Small menu very expensive no water no coffee pot. That staple is a big part of vegas and an absolutely missing piece.
10,The room was nice with a wonderful view. Unfortunately our two year old son found an open condom wrapper on the floor near the side of the bed. There was also a used ear plug found near the headboard. The most disappointing part was that when it was brought to the attention of the management he simply said “That’s why we already talked to housekeeping to look into it.” I had to ask if anything else would be done. At that point is when the supervisor offered to refund the resort fee. There was no apology.
50,Definitely be back . The best hotel in the middle of the strip. Everything is reasonable walking distance.Very friendly and helpful staff. Clean rooms and casino. Eataly is just amazing place to eat and relax.
50,The hotel was very clean and the staff was friendly and inviting. We traveled with our dog and there is a small facility out front for the dogs to handle their business. The parking lot was close by the hotel and easy to access.
50,If you're looking for a smoke free casino that combines being able to get closer access to other casinos look no further. The restaurants have great food the staff are courteous friendly and helpful. It's very clean and I feel secure staying in this hotel.
50,The hotel is the only one on the strip that is smoke free which was beyond refreshing. I found myself only staying within the park because of that. It was very clean and was being maintained regularly by staff that just made the stay that much more enjoyable. The food at eatery was SO DELICIOUS and the restaurant Best Friends was such a great time with the most amazing food. I did not want to leave the park and would’ve extended my stay if it wasn’t for work!! The casino was also Top Tier no hotel on the strip can compare to how great the park is and I have stayed at Caesar’s Venetian palazzo Bellagio and other lesser hotels on the strip.
30,The heat wasn’t working in the room. Didn’t have the maintenance come repair due to Covid concerns. Other than that it was a good time experience. The staff was friendly and welcoming. Housekeeping is as exceptional.
50,Very much enjoy the Park MGM. Rooms are very clean the staff is very friendly and the location is excellent for access to many Las Vegas events. In addition it is non-smoking so the air throughout the property is clean.
40,Food is good safety of guests is ensured by maintaining heath protocol. Rooms are clean and staff are very responsive. Elevators and other amenities are well maintained. Tranquility and solitude is felt.
20,Sydney from Hawaii with the blonde curly hair was not friendly. She had an attitude and could use some customer service training. She made my last day extremely unpleasant by giving me a hard time trying to get in my room even though my credit card with my name was on file my id matched the mailing address and I showed her the email confirmations.
50,Park MGM was a great time from the food location entertainment inside and the friendly staff. Room was clean. Highly recommend! 10/10. Rose was a great blackjack dealer and I highly recommend learning the game from her.
40,No smoking. That’s what I need. Clean air. Convenient self parking. Easy check in and check out. Eataly was great but need more variety if you stay longer. Very good location to entertainment for sporting events and concerts.
50,Took the family for new years. Great location staff and rooms. We had a strip view right accross from the MGM and had a perfect view of the fireworks! Loved all the shops and food places within walking distance. Made it perfect while traveling with the kiddos. Our new favorite location!
50,Room clean. Beautiful view bed comfortable. Elevators slow. Love the mask wearing and No smoking. Went to concert at Park Theater and didn’t have to leave hotel. Gambling fun not over crowded. Felt safe in hotel gamble until early morning hours and went back to room alone. Will stay again
50,Great location - great service. Loved the bartenders at the main video poker bar. Primrose was also a nice restaurant for breakfast. Convenient to T-Mobil arena and connected to the Aria. Rooms are small but clean and recently remodled
50,Great non -smoking casino. Only thing I could ask for is more places to eat other than the Eataly area. Employee's were friendly and the room was clean. Bigger than most rooms in the same price range. Oh and the bed was dope too.
50,Best staff made the stay great. No request was an issue. Best customer service I’ve had. Definitely there to make sure your visit is the best on the strip. Great rooms great casino great location. Our first choice every time we visit.
40,This was our first time staying at the Park MGM since it was renovated from the old Monte Carlo. We loved the Eataly Food Court / Restaurant area. It had a wide variety of options for meals and snacks. The property was easy to navigate and the staff was friendly and polite. The lone downside was the room. They installed barn door style sliders for the bathroom/closet. The problem is that if someone is in the closet/safe it prohibits entry or exit of the bathroom. Not a wise layout decision. Other than that we loved how accessible it was to T Mobile Arena and the Beerhaus courtyard tailgating experience before the Golden Knights game was so much fun! Definitely coming back for another game and definitely booking at Park MGM again!
10,I’m not going to get into details… lets be honest nobody cares. But honestly the WORST SERVICE & EMPLOYEES I’ve ever had the misfortune to experience and room was covered in DUST. Bartenders seem to be agitated just doing their jobs. I’ve never felt more UNWELCOME in LAS VEGAS. From check in to departure (where luckily I CHECKED THE BILL) TRUST ME! Stay somewhere else YOU will thank me!
20,I booked this room to celebrate my 40th birthday. From check in to check out there is an issue every day. My main concern was the cleanliness of the rooms especially the bathroom and the bed areas. My secondary guess took it upon themselves to reclaim the bathroom. During a covid climate at the least I would expect cleanliness. The room was so dusty that it aggravated my allergies.    Based on the website and the MGM brand what I experienced was very disheartening for me for my 40th birthday vacation.
40,The rooms weren't impressive and being Gold didn't seem to matter to people. It's a cool spot if you don't want to be crammed with people and smell like an ashtray and it's easy enough to get anywhere.
40,Stayed 3 nights (Sun-Wed) at the smoke free Park MGM during a 7-night solo Vegas trip this month. The hotel was very busy on Sunday with Raiders football fans but it calmed down Monday and Tuesday. I checked in using the MGM app and received a message at 10 a.m. that my room on the 25th floor was ready. The room overlooked the closed pools Vdara Cosmo and the many hotels to the north and west. It was not a strip view but pleasant anyway.    Except for the dirty carpeting the room was clean and being at the end of the hall it was quiet. I did not hear any noise from other rooms or in the hallway. They did an awesome job with the Monte Carlo remodel. The bed was comfortable and linens soft. The 50” TV was a nice touch with lots of channels and streaming capability. Shower pressure good lots of hot water towels fluffy. A large round beat up table took up a lot of floor space by a long window couch. Desk and chair would make more sense. There were a few small drawers in the closet so not much room to unpack if you are staying several days.    The high resort fee -- $44.22 a night -- is ridiculous in the winter when the pools are closed. Not sure what it covers....no bottled water or in room coffee or refrigerator provided for the hefty fee. Quite a rip off.    Other than taking Lyft to Resorts World Monday night I gambled and spent most of my time at Park MGM or Aria. There was a good mix of slot machines with many of the newer ones and they were kept clean. Loved the center video poker bar and started each day there with a bloody mary. ALL of the staff I encountered except for one dealer were pleasant and friendly.    RESTAURANTS: Primrose had good ambiance and decor with exceptional service but pricey. Fresh fruit and cobb salad with a hot tea was over $40. I was not impressed with Eataly and 2 items purchased there on 2 different days were cold dried out overpriced and not worth eating. A small (4 oz) ravioli portion was $22. Crack Shack had decent fried chicken.    COMPLAINTS? Just a few. The high resort fee mentioned above. Also I was disappointed there was no $25 two deck BJ. All blackjack was from an 8 deck shoe...even the $25 minimum table. The masking policy is not enforced. Many were in elevators and walking around unmasked. They need to do better policing this with covid running rampant.
50,Everything went as planned if not better. The parking garage attendant was actually helpful & the check in process was expedited with help. Our stay was awesome & the vitamin C shower definitely lived up to the hype. Lots of food variety and easily accessible. Was worth staying the entire weekend.
10,The rooms were dirty. With covid being what it is you would think the rooms would have been spotless. We never wound up staying and they still charged us for the room. Still trying to get our money back
50,The hotel and casino are very nice no smoking on the property is amazing and an outlier in Vegas. Worth it just for that. Everything is centrally located and easy to find. Much more pleasant that your usual casino where you walk around for an hour just find anything. The hotel is also pet friendly for a price. Best Friend right in the entryway is one of the best meals you’ll have in Vegas without spending a fortune but it is easy to get carried away and order too much! The fried chicken and kimchi fried rice are a must and the mango cheesecake is incredible.
10,We come to :as Vegas a lot to catch hockey games. Usually we stay at the New York New York. We thought we would try the park out. Big mistake from the start. The first room was so moldy smelling and the bathroom looked straight out of Motel 6. They moved us to another room which was better than mold room. Still the set up was bad. No desk for business travel. Just a large table wasting room space. No dresser but 4 little drawers in closet Tiny closet with 6 hangers. There was 2 of us for 4 nights so not really convenient. If you want coffee before you am you have to leave the hotel. There is no coffee maker in room. There’s no mini fridge so lots of trips to ice machine. The staff at front desk weren’t overly friendly. The only pluses are location strong water pressure in shower and the housekeeping were very friendly.
50,We traveled to Vegas for my son's 21st birthday. The Park MGM is in a great location. We had 3 rooms a King a Queen and a Suite. All 3 rooms were clean and comfortable. When leaving our hotel and entering other hotels I could really notice how much cleaner the Park MGM was. Other hotels were very smoky. When returning to Park MGM I could smell how clean the hotel was!
50,Clean beautiful and upscale hotel and casino. Loved the music service and variety offered. Food is spendy but that’s expected these days. Enjoyed the convenience of having my room key on my phone. Smoke free kept me from smelling like an ashtray after playing in the casino!
50,Lots of great places to eat in the hotel and nearby we will be staying here again. The bests were not the best but they have great pillows staff was very friendly great service and it’s great that it is non smoking if you plan on taking your kids.
40,Nice place to stay with reasonable weekday rates. Good strip location to restaurants and shopping. Super close to T-Mobile Arena which is perfect for attending event at Arena. It was remodeled a few years ago and is much nicer now.
40,I love that the property is smoke-free as well as the proximity to top venues and dining. Additionally Park MGM's location means that other top properties such as the Cosmo Aria and Bellagio are all an easy walk.
40,Loved the resort because of the non-smoking policy. The only hotel I will stay at when visiting Las Vegas.The resort fee is unfair and illegal.  The Casino was excellent with friendly dealers. Eataly our favorite dining option. Need more non-smoking resorts in Vegas.
40,Overall a good place for the value. It is excellent that this is a non-smoking casino. The rooms seemed a little dated compared to other locations but overall was good place to stay and sleep. Food was all good!
30,Very inconvenient for late nighters. If you are the type of person who likes to get late night snacks or meals this is not a good place to stay. Staff will direct you across the street to New York New York.
50,Love this place  good restaurants all delicious. Quite not crowded like other big hotels. If you want a chill hotel great restaurants gaming and comfortable rooms Park MGM is it. Italy is also located there.
30,The remodel of the old Monte Carlo was nice even though sad to see it leave. Awesome that it’s a smoke free casino especially if you take kids. Here’s the bad the mattress’ feel bad already. The showers weren’t level and your feet are in your same dirty water not good.
50,This is the only non-smoking hotel in Vegas and we loved staying here.The staff were all so friendly and helpful. Dustin at the front desk was so accomodating as we had several requests. The rooms were lovely and had everything we needed. The only issue we had the entire time was that the heat was hard to regulate. We could never get it just right. The rooms do not have a fridge or microwave. This hotel is extremely quiet when you're in your room. The casino is nice too but the tables have a high minimum. I would definitely stay here again.
40,If you're sleeping in a room near the T-Mobile there is 24/7 music coming from possibly New York New York that keeps you awake at night. The location was nice and very close to T-Mobile arena and convenient to get to the elevators and to ride shares without having to walk too far.
50,The room was just a room nothing special about it but the hotel as a whole was great! Great location to easily get down or across the strip. Would definitely recommend Park MGM and would stay there again.
50,I’m not much of a gambler but the rooms were clean and comfortable and I loved the 20’s vibe! Eataly was so fun and and lala noodle was so delicious! Everywhere we went the staff was attentive and friendly. The only negative was we could not get the room cool. It was January so not much of an issue but I would imagine in the summer that might be a problem. Overall though it was a great first trip to Las Vegas!
40,Location of hotel is very central which makes it within easy walking distance. The La La Noodle and Shake Shack restaurants were good. Didn't care for the Pasta and Pizza place in the Eataly. The park area is nice to stroll and have a picnic.    Black out Roman Shades are perfect for sleeping in. The walls are quite thin so if you have noisy neighbors good luck. The rooms could use a makeover but other than that a decent place.
50,We stayed in the Nighthawk Suite which I totally recommend. It’s not fancy with tons of amenities but it’s clean spacious and has a newness that a lot of other hotels lack. Beds were comfy and room was quiet. Room service was quick and surprisingly fantastic. The hotel lobby vibe was mellow with not a huge party scene and the hotel is non-smoking which is fantastic. There are some great restaurants in the lobby including Best Friend lala noodle and Eataly. I would recommend this hotel for a family but if possible stay in the suite because I’ve heard the standard rooms are small.
50,The next time you are considering a trip with a young family and looking to stay in one of the Mlife properties then consider the Park MGM. I think this property is ideal specially during the winter season. I've taken the family to the non-gaming hotels within the Mlife (Signature Vdara Delano) but this one is great for the kids because it is non-smoking and centrally located. The Eataly food options are great for young and old. If they kids need pizza arcade etc. it is just a short walk across bridge or street. Give the Park MGM a try.
50,Excellent Stay for CES EDGE Conference. Enjoyed every aspect of my stay. I enjoyed all aspects including staff location and amenities. I also enjoyed the food options at Park MGM. I also enjoyed the casino aspects of the location and staff was phenomenal.
40,Wound up being very sick and stuck in my room. Very small room with little to no amenity. Basic standard hotel room. If you're looking for standard this is what you'll get. It wasn't bad but it sure wasn't a 4star hotel.
40,"The Park MGM was outstanding in its hosting of the EDGE 22 conference for the GBEF / CES event - great service from staff and great facilities that were cleaned and courteous reminders to ""Please put your mask on."""
50,Love the size of hotel and casino. Good location and trams are close by to get around. Standard 2 bedroom is small but okay. Employees are friendly and personable. Didn't use pool but maybe next time when it's warmer. Love the Italian venue Eataly. There isn't too many eating venues here but there are many places to eat at the surrounding areas and hotels (NY Ny Aria). The one thing I love the most Park MGM is completely Non Smoking. They need to change more hotels to non smoking.
30,bavette's is probably my favorite steakhouse in vegas. top marks across the board. the hotel common areas are all fine. but they don't seem to have fixed the major complaint about the old monte carlo when they remodeled: the rooms have paper thin walls. there are just some things you can't un-hear. :(
50,Came to watch Vegas Knights vs NY Rangers the arena was located next door to the hotel. Plenty of things to do and eat nearby. Short rib tacos at the eatery called Best Friends was delicious! Casino wasn’t too packed and plenty of tables to play at. Would stay here again!
40,Park MGM is great in that no one can some inside. However you will also be thirsty playing games. Otherwise this is a good location with plenty to do around. I would end you night here with your final game and go to other casinos first.
40,nice hotel casino and eatery facility; room was clean; carpets are outdated; lacking coffee machine & ability to make hot water; parking was very convenient - park at level 2 to have walk way access to hotel
10,Don’t stay here. Disgusting and they moved me without my knowledge into the Nomad. Was dark smelled like weed. Low ceilings at ~8ft makes it feel like a cave. I will not return even though I enjoy the casino.
40,We had a nice stay here. Our room was large and generally quiet. The one exception was during the hockey game at the adjacent arena. Apparently whenever the Golden Knights score a goal they blow a mind numbing foghorn! It took us a moment to figure out what was happening when it blew.    We enjoyed the casino though it would have been more enjoyable had we won...😆    Dining was terrific at Eataly a collection of Italian cafes bakeries and pizzarias. We also had a wonderful meal at Lola Noodles onsite.    There's also a convenient tram station that connects to the Aria and Bellagio casinos that saves a lot of walking for those wanting to explore and shop.
50,My wife love this hotel because of the no smoking policy and also the easy walking distance to the main Las Vegas strip. The only thing next time we stay here is to get the room with the microwave. Other than that the all the staffs were friendly.
40,My wife and I were in town for a Knights/Rangers game at T-Mobile arena. We chose the Park MGM due to its proximity to the arena and were very pleased. The service provided by the front desk on check-in was great as was the service in Primrose. The hotel was clean and we enjoyed several of the amenities. We would recommend the Park MGM and will likely stay again during future stays in Las Vegas.
20,Rooms didn’t appear to be remodeled more than paint. Tub showers and such a small sink room to get ready at. Not to mention the small room. Not badly located on the strip and the Eatery had good food.
40,Overall hotel was very good. Food service and casino was great. Location for the conference was ok but great location for the strip. Best Friend restaurant was very good and the Primose restaurant for breakfast was very good. Good value for the money
40,Can't have a hotel that stops room service at 7pm. The price of the food and the small array of choices for room service doesn't make it a romantic night at all.  The room was spacious and the mattress was comfy.
30,Outdated and creepy hallways. Needs remodeling. Poor lighting and looks very old. Very expensive. The only reason we stayed was the Bruno Mars concert otherwise we would have chosen a much newer hotel. StafF was nice tHough
50,Conveniently located next to the T Mobile center and The Shops at Crystals.  Clean and spacious rooms with comfortable beds4 pillows plenty of plugs and USB outlets.  Great dining at Eataly Crack Shack and Best Friend Korean BBQ.
10,Rooms not up to standard considering it’s a MGM property  Very thin room walls hard to sleep at night  No phone jack in the room and no closet door  Slow moving water in the shower tub  Do not stay in this hotel
10,We had an absolutely terrible experience while here and also in the aftermath. The hotel itself was lovely but on our first night in the city someone stole a hotel room key from my guest's purse along with unfortunately the room number envelope. Using this information and key they went to the Park MGM while we were out and completely robbed the hotel room of everything of value-- thousands of dollars worth of belongings. We reported this theft to the hotel and they took an incident report and were in communication with the police who ultimately came and took a report for felony burglary and we spent our one full day in Las Vegas inside our hotel room. The hotel did at least let us move rooms as we no longer felt safe there but it was a room that technically was a downgrade from the room we had previously. At that point it didn't really matter.  My largest complaint is regarding the lack of communication we have received regarding the incident from the hotel management and corporate offices despite my emails to them. The security office called once after I sent a followup and offered me some information though the hotel frequently told us it was against policy to discuss what was on the security videos and took no liability leaving us with little information and little hope we might get our belongings back. We have been incredibly put-out by the experience and have received SO little communication or assistance.  Despite the size of our loss all we were offered was 'free' EMPTY champagne glasses-- which they would normally charge $30+ for-- and a night of valet parking was covered for my guest's car as they had stolen her car keys as well and didn't want them returning to take that too. That is the only relief we were offered still paying extra at check out for resort fees for a resort we did not enjoy and an extra thousand for the room on top of what we had stolen. We were victims of felony burglary at their hotel and the hotel gave us free empty glasses and a night of parking. Even if not liable I expected something helpful or some acknowledgement of how awful this experience has been. Since then there has been no communication regarding the case besides a call from the security office. I emailed corporate and management about this and they never called or contacted us regarding our experience or this incident.  Communication really goes a long way with guests and the feeling that the hotel didn't care that this happened simply because they were not 'responsible' really only made the experience worse. I had held off on writing reviews expressing this as I was hoping to hear something from the hotel but at this point it is clear that isn't going to happen. My frustration with the hotel and MGM corporate extends far beyond just 'we were robbed'-- they frankly do not care about their guests.
50,Hotel room was super clean staff was super friendly and helpful food choice was excellent. Will recommend to friends and family for future visits. Location is almost center strip not far from Bellagio.
50,We had a great experience at The Park and were extremely thrilled that is was smoke free! All of the staff was extremely helpful and kind ensuring our experience was incredible. With access to other great casinos staying with MGM is an awesome way to experience Vegas. As a veteran it was nice to see they offer discounts through their MLife service! MGM definitely gained a loyal customer with this experience!!
20,I would never stay at this property again. I found the bed very uncomfortable and the rooms to be very small. Not at all what I remember from when I stayed here while it was the Monte Carlo resort and casino
50,We arrived at the MGM late due to flightas soon as we arrived our room key was on my phone didn’t have to wait in line the room and view was spectacular clean and a bit more of a room than I thought we were getting thanks for the great accommodations we’ll be back real soon
10,Hotel was terrible. Room dirty and far below what I have come to expect from MGM. Worst “new” property I’ve ever stayed in. No functional vent in restroom open steel conduit running from wall to ceiling lights dust caked on vents in room furniture looked like it was purchased at Gargage sell.
20,I booked a suite to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday. I spoke at length with the concierge the front desk and even the spa to make sure everything was in order before we arrived. We did get in late - around 11:45pm/midnight - so I understand front desk staff being tired but we just received no kindness no effort nothing to make us feel welcome. It was a silent 15 min process with not even an indication of how to get to the elevators. When we arrived at the suite none of the balloons gift basket or amenities I ordered were in the room and we were close to the elevator (the one thing I had requested for the room was to not be near the elevator - that's a nightmare in vegas if you want to sleep). The room was not what i thought it was going to be. It truly felt like false advertising after seeing it in person compared to the photos online. The towels gave me the creeps and the room feels like someone's afterthought. I went back to the front desk immediately after check in and was again disappointed with the lack of customer service or concern. I decided to start fresh the next day and see if I could move rooms be refunded for my gift money and just call it a wash on all the time I lost and am currently losing in this endeavor. I had a similar experience at the front desk again. Essentially there wasn't a real solution to getting me in to a new room. They were wanting to charge me upgrade fees for rooms that cost half what I already paid and that just didn't make sense to me. I am supposedly getting my money back for all the gifts that didn't arrive and the concierge gave me a voucher for $50 to apologize for the bad service which was the only light in this dark tunnel. All in all it's been a disappointing and underwhelming experience. I would recommend finding an alternative location if you're considering staying here.
50,Stayed at the Park MGM Hotel first week of January 2022. Check in was pretty easy and we were able to get adjoined rooms. Hotel is very clean the staff is wonderful. Restaurants and bars are solid. Primrose is very good for breakfast and lunch - highly recommend. Hotel is the perfect size and glad to see they don't allow smoking. Also the casino staff was enforcing mask wearing especially at gambling tables. This is a nice property if you aren't looking for anything over the top. No complaints at all!
50,Came for my grandsons wedding and had a great stay at the Park MGM. Beautiful hotel with nice people and great service by all employees. Had never been before will definitely be back. I have a nephew that lives in Vegas.
50,The Park MGM is one of favorite casinos on the Strip! It's in a good location that is close to many of the more popular casinos (Cosmopolitan Bellagio MGM Grand etc.) and is just a short walk from the T-Mobile Arena. The rooms are nicely done and we thought the beds were comfortable. Eataly is a fun touch that makes it easy to get a quick bite for a cheaper price if not wanting a large meal. Park MGM also has one of our favorite restaurants in the entire strip: Best Friend by Roy Choi . We highly recommend it if you have never been there!
50,This hotel is the perfect size. Not too big not too small. It's designed perfectly with all points easy to find. It is clean and well kept. The only disappointment was the fact that they don't enforce their own mask mandate. There were a lot of people in the casino without masks.
50,Great way to end the year! Entire staff at Park MGM were professional and helpful. Hotel itself is very clean. Great that this a Smoke-free hotel. Great restaurants and lounges!  Bruno Mars concert was GREAT!!!
50,Love the no smoking policy in the casino. The sports book and sports bar are great!! Very close to the neighboring casinos I like. Aria Bellagio Cosmopolitan… Also can catch a Knights game. see you in a couple months.
50,I have over 20 years of history with this Property…as the Monte Carlo and now the Park. Staff is friendly Casino is clean amd smoke free! I like the addition of Eataly and the sportsbook. I think the rooms are spacious comfortable and clean and finally the bathroom shower was fantastic!
40,The room was beautiful and clean. I love that the Casino is non smoking and my favorite part was that they have a Starbucks in the property. They have a variety of games to play also on the high limit area. The one thing I was unhappy about that the employee gave us incorrect I formation constantly and we were waiting on the wrong lines for nothing.
20,My wife and I arrived at 4am on Friday morning. We stood in line for about 3 minutes before being greeted by Daniel. He said they weren’t able to locate our room/stay. He had to make some phone calls to see what was going on. After about 15 minutes we were given 2 room keys for room 28-116. We got up to the room and both key card did not work. We kept it in the folder that was handed to us as we understand keeping it elsewhere can mess up the card key. Both keys did not work so we went back down stairs I asked Daniel if he can help us out after he was done with the customer he was with and he said okay. Then his co worker working the other kiosk right next to him yelled across that I had to stand in line. I told her I was just down here and waited in line already she said you still have to stand in line. So I got in line 4 ahead of me and I was upset since we already stayed in line and was issued 2 cards that did not work. After waiting in line again I went up and got 2 more new cards for the same room from Daniel. Again we went up to the same room and both keys did not work AGAIN. Also heard a mans voice behind the door. At this point my wife’s feet were tired as she’s pregnant and after a 6 hour drive just wanted to relax in bed. We went back down stairs and told them it didn’t work and that we heard voice in the room and I told him I think he gave us a room that was already occupied. He issued me another room on the 8th floor and was escorted by security and we were able to get right in! Super excited to just relax. Security left and we grabbed the phone for bell desk to bring up on bags. (12 bags) when I reached for the phone I noticed there wasn’t a tone to it and it was plugged. I tried to trouble shoot but still didn’t work. We was extremely disappointed angry sad all the above. We then went back down stairs and was issued a different room which everything worked to what we expect out of a place like park mgm. I was having a conversation with my wife while we waited for bell service to bring up our bags and we decided that it was going to be our last time staying there. Angel from bell service came up and asked about my experience. And I stated all the above and she was so understanding. She empathized and even gave us 2 vouchers to bettys to help improve our experience! Even though we we felt like what was given to us wasn’t worth the experience I felt that Angel went above and beyond to attempt to try and make us happy. Epitome of greatness!
50,We loved our stay at the Park MGM! Checking in was very efficient the staff very friendly.  Rooms were clean and updated. Good choice of restaurants. The gaming was fun and the cocktail service prompt! Overall an exceptional experience! We highly recommend and will stay there again.
50,Park MGM hotel is one of the best place in Las Vegas if you want to unwind . Their staff are friendly courteous and warm . The place is huge and clean and highly accessible to different places in the strip . Highly recommended
50,Great location. Lots of places to eat nearby. Room was comfortable and nicely decorated. We ate at Eataly a couple of times. Bruno Mars concert was one of the best we’ve attended. I highly recommend this casino. We look forward to staying there again
50,This property is very clean. The staff was polite. The room was spacious and very clean. I liked the fact that this casino was smoke free. Had a great time. Over all great stay and will definitely go back.
40,The smoke free casino cozy lobby Eataly and location of Park MGM made our NYE celebration enjoyable. My husband and I celebrated his birthday at the Bruno Mars concert next door at the Park MGM Theatre and then fireworks on Las Vegas Blvd. just a few steps away from the hotel lobby. Hotel service was excellent with consideration of the pandemic still in place. The only underwhelming thing was the furnishing aesthetics of the room environment which made you feel more like you were a motel than at a MGM hotel.
50,Went to Vegas for CES 2022 and stopped in to Eataly for a drink. Great service excellent ambience and great wine. There was a super nice security guard (Hank) who took time to talk wine with us and just be friendly. Looking forward to coming back!
50,We were strolling the strip and wandered into Eataly to look around. We were looking for a place to grab a glass of wine but all of the bars looked full. We noticed the wine shop and were perusing the aisles when Hank Graae a security guard informed us of wine tasting flight available nearby. We happened to be here around happy hour too and were absolutely delighted to have a nice peaceful area to enjoy and try some new wines. We are so glad he helped us find something better than what we were looking for! A lovely relaxed evening for two.
50,I loved staying at the Park MGM. One of the cleanest hotels I've seen on the Strip (being recently remodeled certainly helps) my room was spacious the bedding was very comfortable -- a rarity in hotels these days! -- the blackout curtains worked TOO well (light leaks from the Strip were certainly not a problem!) I loved the walk-in shower and the shower also had great water pressure. Park MGM also has an excellent selection of bars and restaurants so you never really have to leave (Eataly Best Friend Bavette's Juniper -- all excellent). The entirely digital key is genius -- no waiting in line to check in even at a kiosk (which tends to make the process even longer) you just do it all from your phone even the night before and then send you your room info and digital key when it's ready. Parking was $15/night which compared to overnight parking in any other major city in America is still a steal. They get you with the $60/night resort fee but you get a lot more at Park MGM than you do at far lower-quality resorts that still charge $45/night resort fees. I loved it!
20,you can hear snoring sound from next room and they can wake you up with their alarm and romantic sound. every moments that you want to use the parking lot you have to request to open the bar via emergency call
40,The hotel was honestly wonderful. However I cannot get past the fact that there were no coffee pots. Vegas is a nightlife city and at 33 years old I essentially need an IV of coffee to function so this was a huge negative for me. There is a Starbucks in the lobby but because no one has a coffee pot in their room the lines were always SOOOO long. Waiting in line while uncaffeinated is not ideal. Additionally no mini fridge but you can rent one for a daily fee. My friend was staying at the hotel at the same time and was storing her breast milk in a bucket of ice. That being said these are my only qualms everything else was great. The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful the dining options were plentiful and delicious comfy beds great location on the strip--all around it's a great spot I just really really wish they had coffee pots.
50,I've never stayed here but I really like the Park MGM. I love MGM properties but this hotel was smaller and I could find everything. Friendly staff and I loved checking in through an app and using the digital key. The room was nice and spacious and I got plenty of rest in between the fun. I loved the casino and ate at Primrose for breakfast and the food was delicious. I would definitely go back.
50,Great location with spacious well-designed rooms and casino fabulous restaurants (some of which are very foody-oriented and affordable e.g. in the Eataly area). Also this casino is less overwhelming than other casinos- very easy to navigate. Excellent spa.
50,So much about this hotel is great and made our Vegas trip awesome. It is a smaller hotel so you don’t feel like you are walking for miles to get across it. Yet the location is perfect and even has a tram stop accessible without leaving the property. The staff is friendly and goes out of their way to be kind. They have amazing food right in the hotel; an upscale cafeteria with lots of options and Primrose for breakfast which has the most amazing salmon avocado toast. Everything was clean and nice and comfortable. We came for a special NYE trip and brought our 50 pound dog. Everyone was so nice to her and the room was so great for her. Of all the resorts I have experienced on the strip this is the easiest to have a dog. Even when she woke me up in the middle of the night we were able to make it outside in 2 minutes flat. There is an astroturf spot right past the valet stand out the front doors with bags provided and a lot of landscaped areas of sand rock or dirt dotted with bushes and plants to stretch puppy legs and explore. She even surprised a couple of little bunnies 🐰 in the bushes. We had a view of the MGM Grand so on NYE we were able to sit on our plush red velvet couch in our room just us and our puppy and watch the countdown and fireworks out the window. It was a magical trip and the Park MGM was the perfect place to stay.
50,I was there for a venue next door. Staff was great room was very impressive. Very peaceful for a hotel/casino. Great stores and restaurants.  I thoroughly enjoyed my stay. I will definitely stay there again.
50,Stayed a few nights at Park MGM for the New Years Eve Bruno Mars concert. We’ll definitely be back! The check in process was quick and very smooth the staff were all friendly the room was beautiful the strip view was awesome and the bed and pillows were super comfortable! The location is also very convenient to restaurants and shops at the south end of the strip. There’s a foot bridge right in front of the hotel for easy access to cross the street. Loved every minute of our stay.
10,Not pet friendly as I would say. Got a rude phone call from front desk regarding my dogs barking left them for few minutes to go to parking garage. Lady was yelling at me and threatening to charge me more if I didn't make my dogs stop barking when I came down the hall I didnt hear any barking.
30,Was only there overnight so just needed a place to sleep. The music from T-Mobile center was blaring and shaking my room. You can hear everything your neighbors are doing. Seems to be a gap in the wall against the windows to where you can hear everything. The bathrooms look like something from a motel6 in the 80s. Who uses bathtub showers anymore? The only saving grace is the entire hotel is smoke free.
20,We had a bad check-in and dirty room upon entering. We truly wanted to love this place however we have not had the best experiences staying at MGM properties. We loved the Aria but even had our fair share of issues there w/ our lock box not working and then the battery pad for our door was dead and had to wait a couple of hours not sure why us.
30,food very expensive buffet closed no microwave to reheat leftover food no fridge to store your own drinks 1 pepsi 5.00. hamburger 28.00 hotel room average have stayed in nicer for less Bruno Mars show disappointing for the price. 930pm til 1115pm show over
40,I love this hotel for so many reasons. It is non-smoking for one so the air is fresh and you don't have to choose a slot machine based on who's smoking around you. I've had such good pay-back on the machines so entertainment value is great. There are terrific shows right at the Park too (ex: Lady Gaga!) The recent Eataly area provides so many dining options. it's in such a convenient location and easy walk to shops arenas restaurants and the strip. Staff here are really helpful and professional. It is my experience that guests and staff here respect the health requirements for keeping everyone safe. I'll definitely be back.
40,This is our second time staying at Park MGM. I really like the location and the restaurants inside this hotel. Best Friend and Mama Rabbit are both amazing and super fun atmospheres. The fact that the entire casino is smoke-free is great and they now have a mobile check-in you can do from your phone that is crazy convenient and smart. The rooms are just alright. They're styled cute beds are decent and pillows are so soft (which for me is the worst but for some may be great). The room was super warm (in December) and turning the AC down to 65 didn't really help. We stayed over New Years so the rooms were priced very high but I think they're more reasonably priced for what you get not over a holiday. Our last stay was in May and we had access to the pool. The pool is more lowkey and not a crazy Vegas party pool which is what we were looking for at the time. All in all if you're looking for great food convenient location mid-priced and a smoke-free casino I would recommend this hotel.
20,AC is eco friendly so when there is no movement there is no air. It sucks waking up sweating and you have to get up and move for the ac to come back on. I have never been in a hotel where ac does this
30,The hotel is nice and nicely located in the centre of the strip. We appreciated the tram that connected us to up to the Bellagio. The casino area is not as big as some of the other hotels. Our only dissatisfaction was the room which was not very clean. There was dust everywhere a big white stain on the sofa that made us not want to go near it and the worst was the sink which was clogged up during our entire stay there. Fortunately the shower was nice and big.
20,First thing when we get to a hotel is to always check the room for any broken or missing things and the room was missing a fridge. I believe I read in the description of the room that one would be provided but nope! The room itself was decent with nice décor but the walls are fairly thin that you can hear when your neighbor coughs or talks loudly. I wouldn't recommend this hotel if you are looking for some peace and quiet.
50,Great value for what you get. The room was clean and cozy. The staff was friendly and efficient. The property is clean and convenient for attending events at allegient stadium. The barn door for the bathroom is a little weird but that’s my only “complaint” about the stay. I used the app to check in and out and also used it for the digital key. Super convenient!
50,Children friendly as the whole casino is non-smoking not exposing your children to cigarette smoke as you make your way to your room or the strip. Easy access from parking garage to hotel lobby and rooms. Eataly has some of the best Italian food and dessert items around.
20,Paid 3000.00 for a package that was not worth it because of room being terrible and out of date only thing good was concert but I just think for that amount it should be more to offer besides a room that was just not up to par for a person paying top dollar.
50,Stayed 4 nights at Park MGM in early Dec/21 and came across the nicest man in Las Vegas Hank Graae. He's dressed as a security guard in Early but actually doubles as a wine connoisseur and an amazing host. I hope Park MGM realizes what they have with a gentleman like this employed there. A guy that goes above and beyond from helping to choose a wine within my price range to inviting you to Eatly's amazing happy hour with a private table for dinner. Had one of my best trips in Vegas that week and will defiantly be coming back in 2022 and hopefully will be able too hake hands with Mr. Graae once again.
40,MGM Park is very good hotel  it is a great place to stay and its staff is very friendly and helpful Room Dining service I experienced issue in getting plates etc but overall very good Its a good place for playing slotting machine in casino
50,Really reasonable great location fabulous restaurants and great night life all tucked away inside this hotel. My husband and I enjoyed our room and view of the strip. Rooms are clean and a nice size.
50,Friendly staff except if you smoke. No tolerance for smokers anywhere. Great restaurants. Great bell service and front desk. No smoking in the casino area or anywhere. I transferred from the New York New York because smokers in the casino trashed it.
40,Park MGM is perfect non-smoking hotel to stay at. Tables are a little high priced but most major casino's are now a days. Nothing was under $20 on a Tue & Wed!!! Rooms are super clean and NEW!!! Loved the Self Check in and keyless room entry(phone)!
50,Great overall experience at the hotel. The neighbors were a little loud at times... that's ok they were probably on their honeymoon. Bruno Mars was great that little guy has a ton of energy and he is probably one of the most talented individuals in the music industry.
40,The property is clean. Also there are a variety of restaurant choices and clothing shops to enjoy at the property. The property is situated in a good location with access to other stores and hotels on the Las Vegas strip.
20,My 3 day stay at Park MGM was not a good experience as far as getting a good night sleep. There was loud music outside the hotel and i could hear it at ALL hours of the night and into the early morning hours. I think there was a park across the street that plays music 24/7 which ruined any chance of getting sleep. No fridge no dresser in main room small tv and all at a high price point that was leaving my convinced to stay somewhere else on my next trip.
10,Very poor value for what was suppose to be a deluxe king with view. Small. No counter space. No room for toiletries. TV placed on wall opposite another wall. Closet very small. No refrigerator. No amenities. Glasses were always dirty.
30,No cleaning service on first night and asked fresh towels…  Smells like little smoked at very first get in the room so I reported front desk by room phone…  Even no clock in the room weird….  Very dirty hallway floor…
50,We stayed 4 nights and enjoyed it. The beds and pillows were especially comfortable. The bathroom was clean large and nice. We especially appreciated the smoke free environment it was really nice compared to other smelly casinos.
10,Called the front desk about this issue and they mentioned that the housekeeping department was short-staffed. Our family was gone for at least 8 hours/day and purposely removed the Do Not Disturb tag each time for the purpose of getting our room cleaned and we would come back to our room in the evening the room was exactly how it was before we left earlier that day.
50,We’ve stayed at the Park MGM 4 times now. We love the location (right across from the Arena). The amenities are awesome and the staff are all friendly and helpful. Check in was simple. Download the app and get a digital key.
50,Love that Park is a smaller non smoking hotel. All the staff was friendly and helpful. Room was better than expected. Nice selection of restaurants. I only wish the slots were looser. Will definitely stay here again.
50,This hotel has a very nice old world atmosphere and feels very different from the other hotel casinos on the strip. Dinner at Eataly Pizza was fun too. We loved our stay and we will be back! I will be recommending this to friends and family
40,Everybody are satisfied and happy for wonderful services they got all my friends and family got their rooms in Park MGM so that we can easily each other and the parking are no so hard to get sometimes we do the self or valey parking
50,We went to vegas in a business trip and had some fun in new years eve also. Was a nice little vacation. We definitely will be doing it again soon. First time going to las vegas. All the staff was very friendly.
30,Loved that the park mgm was a non smoking casino. The room was very clean the electronic check in and electronic key was great. Park MGM is located very close to other casinos and eating establishments. Bed seemed to have a dip in the middle.
50,Didn’t get my feee play it was a disappointment visit. I would stay some where else at a different casino to get my free play. I didn’t know that to can’t get free play within the month. I have stayed at Moe age and NYNY and got my free play within the month. Please inform me if it’s not true.
50,You will never be disappointed when it comes to MGM and if anything happens they’re actually here for you. The staff is amazing the restaurants are fantastic and if you need anything they have your back. No matter where you go just choose MGM.
50,We had a Nightingale Suite with a strip view / the setup was nice with comfortable furniture plenty of room and a nice wet bar area. The beds were a bit firm for me but didn't prevent me from sleeping. The bathroom was nice with a nice powerful shower and separate toilet area. All employees were quite courteous and having the Eataly area downstairs was a perk - very convenient and went back several times. We had a slight issue with the upstairs neighbors and a (really) late party with loud music but the hotel responded quickly and resolved that. The overall location of the resort was great and I would stay here again.
50,The Park MGM is a totally smoke free hotel -- unusual and welcome in Las Vegas! Its newer clean well appointed excellent services outstanding staff. And the concert venue is convenient and excellent (we saw Bruno Mars). Etaly is a treasure! The beds are sooo comfy!
10,the room was dated and didn't even have a dresser colors sceme was a depressing drab green color sink in room was clogged stores were mostly closed casino had limited selection beers was $8.50 in the gift shop no amenities in the room. i heard someone next to me say it was the worst hotel he has stayed at and i thought you know what you are tight.
20,Very loud rooms and we were unable to sleep well. We had previously spent the last 10 days in the Strip and this was the loudest hotel by far. The hotel needs to upgrade the windows for better sound proofing. The rooms are older but clean.
40,Trip to attend the Bowl game and spend time with friends. Stayed solo at the hotel. Experience was nice except for loud music coming from The T-mobile stadium at all crazy hours (1-5am 8a-8p) testing of emergency system without warning during the day was also annoying
50,Nice newly remodeled hotel friendly staff and wonderful meal options. Loved the Italy eatery. It’s A nice food court which I really liked because my wife can pick out food she wants and I can get the food I like
40,Room was clean. The shower next-door was super loud. It sounded like the water was on in our room. Aside from that everything else was good. I can’t imagine writing 200 letters as a minimumI didn’t appreciate that
50,Staff was friendly. The smoke free casino floor was a definite plus. Room was clean. The proximity to the other casinos New York New York MGM Excalibur along with the tram to the Aria and Bellagio definitely cut back a lot of the walking we would normally do.
50,The Park MGM is the best casino/resort on the strip. This is our second stay there. Non smoking is the best attribute. The rooms are nice and modern. A good view from the rooms. All of the staff is friendly and helpful. The casino host is responsive and helpful. Great stay.
40,My first time visiting Park MGM and found it to be a very enjoyable visit. The Park MGM is a fully smoke free casino rooms are large well laid out and comfortable. For food options the highlight of the Park MGM would be the Eatery a marketplace with various restaurants with an Italian theme. Also within walking distance of T-Mobile arena.
40,Good location for us. Rooms were ok clean comfortable beds not much storage for clothes no refrigerator. Hallways were really dim made it seem old. Casino was small and slot games were pretty limited.
30,Not a “resort” type of hotel for the price you pay in resort fees. This hotel is just the MGM masquerading as something new and hip. This hotel is a 3 star at best when compared to other MGM properties like the Bellagio.
10,The hotel lobby is great. The non smoking casino is even better. However the rooms are horrible. Worst room I have ever stayed in. The hotel claims to be a 4 star hotel. I have never been in a 4 star hotel that had such horrible tiny rooms. Walls are so thin that you can hear everything that is happening in rooms that are next door to yours. Will never ever stay at this property again.
50,The shower was amazing the water pressure was awesome and the water was hot. The bed was so comfortable and soft. To top it off we had view of strip. I would definitely stay again. Bruno Mars was excellent on New Years Eve!!!
50,This resort is the best I've experienced for a complete non-smoking stay in Las Vegas. Fresh air is everywhere. The staff are always friendly and ready to assist you with any needs. Using the MGM resort app for digital parking room key and check-out was easy.
40,The suite was like the photos online  the only bad thing is the delay on the elevators to get to and from your room to the casino other than that very pleased with our stay there  love going to Vegas and do plan to return to Park Mgm
50,Easily get to many major strip locations. Great restaurants and shops. The smoke free room actually felt like there was no smoking thank you. We really like the contactless check in it was easy and saved us a lot of time. Check out was even easier.
40,Resort felt new and refreshed. Checking in and paying for parking on the app and using the app as a room key was seamless. The room was nice we were upgraded to the nomad part of the hotel without asking. Room lacked a fridge.
30,We used to stay in this hotel when it was Monte Carlo. There was so much hype about remodeling this place so decided to check it out after the newly renovated hotel was finished with new name. Not sure where all the spending went to definitely not the hotel room for sure. The room is plain the barn style bathroom door makes it uneasy for privacy if you are sharing with just casual friend. It you open the bathroom door it close off the drawers and closet next to it. They do not give enough toiletries either.
50,This was our first stay at the Park MGM. We did stay at this property a few times when it was the Monte Carlo. The only thing different in this property is that it no longer has a lazy river and I believe a wave pool. Other than that the property is pretty much the same. I would recommend this hotel. Also my son won at the Blackjack tables on this trip so we will be staying here on our next trip for him.
50,In November 2021 I went to a Vegas Golden Knights hockey game and I wanted to stay near the T-Mobile Arena and after reading the reviews on the many options in Las Vegas I chose the Park MGM and I was not disappointed. Here is my experience:    Arrival: After arriving at about 8:45 pm from Honolulu and picking up the rental car I arrived at the Park MGM. Since I am a Hyatt Hotel Discoverist member I took advantage of the free parking. After parking in the self parking garage making sure I parked near the elevator I walked to the check in area.    Checking In: The check in area was fairly close to the entrance from the parking garage. I was a little surprise to notice the check in area is a little small considering how big the hotel is. The check n area is not as big as the Bellagio hotel. Since I arrived at the hotel at about 10:00 pm the check in area was not the busy. After waiting in line for about 5 minutes the staff member checked me in and I was directed to my room. The check in process took about 10 minutes after the person told me some details of the hotel.    Hyatt Hotel Program: Another reason I stayed at the Park MGM is I was able to earn points on my Hyatt Hotel program. The one benefit was I was able to receive free parking at any MGM hotel since you automatically are a Pearl Member for MGM. Other than that I don't recall any other benefits.    Room: I was assigned a king size bedroom which had a view of the T-Mobile Arena and off to the distance Allegiant Stadium. The room was very spacious for one person and I am sure it would be great for two people. I did request a mini refrigerator which was delivered after I called it in when I got to the room. The bathroom was also spacious. Overall the room was great no major complaints.    Hotel: As others have mentioned the Park MGM is a smoke free hotel and I have to say it is a big difference for a non-smoker to walk throughout the hotel and not smell like smoke after.    Restaurants: There is an Italian market/food court called Eataly (it is the same concept as in other cities) and I enjoyed it. Like a food court you can choose various items and pay at each vendor stall. I had the slice of pizza which I took back to the room and it was excellent.  During breakfast I saw there was one restaurant (Primrose) available. It seems it was the only one open for breakfast and if a person did not have reservations the wait was over 30 minutes. It was suggested to make reservations if you plan to go.  I did see other restaurants at the hotel which I did not go due to my short visit. Hopefully in the future I would be able to go.    Location: Since the hotel is right next to T-Mobile Arena going to the game was very easy. Just be aware that people that drive to the T-Mobile Arena uses the same parking garage as the Park MGM so if you leave the parking garage around the same time a game or concert ends you might be stuck in the traffic.    Checking Out: Checking out was very quick since I used the kiosk.    Overall I was very pleased with the Park MGM. Yes you do pay a resort fee on top of the hotel rate and it is on the strip. But the fact the hotel is nonsmoking and next to the arena are big pluses for me.
30,having no refrigerator was a huge bummer for us. out of 6 hotels we stayed this is the only one without a refrigerator for regular suite. having a smoke free environment was super nice for our family though
50,Loved the clean non smoking hotel and casino. Close access to the tram and monorail. So many food options along with the MGM sports book. The gaming was simply the best. From the slots to the table games. Definitely making another reservation soon!
20,Paid for early check in and there was no room available until 240pm (I was supposed to be able to check in at 11am) No coffee in room very spendy drinksgarage kiosks was broken causing us to back up the traffic and get honked at. Only positive was that it was smoke free.
30,The rooms where not sound proof and you could hear everything from next door rooms. Also parking was a nightmare because our key card wouldn't work so we had to pay at the gate which was find BUT because I selected to pay the $15 a day in the app I was double charged and was only given a credit after I dug out receipts showing I paid for 2 out of the 3 nights I was there. The only up side was being able to attend the concert and walk back to the room afterwards.
20,Staff were excellent. Smoke free entire property. Excellent location. The rooms are not quiet. This was the former Monte Carlo renovated to ParkMGM. You can't renovate the walls (paper thin) and the plumbing.
40,Nicely located on Strip. Friendly staff and good food. Enjoyable entertainment Easy access to taxi. Comfortable room and hot water! Definitely would go back and recommend to family and friends. Looking forward to next time.
50,Great place no smoking. Clean and the place is manage by risk management experts. But the day before check out no one came to clean our room. All we needed was a fresh set of towels. Other than that our stay was great.
30,Stayed here during Christmas 2021. Room is decent with nice decor however walls are thin so if you are a light sleeper or prefer complete silence at night this might not be a great place. The casino is smoke free and has a beautiful food court bars and access to the tram.
50,We were really surprised about the stay. Room was excellent. Great shower and bathroom. We would definitely stay again. Casino was surprisingly nice and was not as crowded as MGM grand which made it nice in the evenings.
50,EXCELLENT service throughout the property! A+++ to Checkin Beautiful Rooms cocktail service when gambling Winning on slots variety of games choice of restaurants!! Easy if garage parking and access to come & go on the property.
30,When I check in to our room  I notice my bathroom sink wasn't draining so well the dirty clog water still on the sink and even the next day when we ask the cleaner to clean our room and bathroom we thought that they notice that clog in the sink and to tell them to maintainace. But instead i wait for 2days. Just imagine how disgusting is that  anyway I had to call them and tell them which is more easy for them to fix it in obviously the cleaners saw it .. but when i call the guy respond quickly that the good thing (but they should double check all the bathroom and room before they let any other guest come in)  and also one thing since we stay for 5days the clearners only changed our sheet only once we had 3 kids with us in connecting rooms obviously the sheets gets mess sometimes but they to lazy to changed our sheet they just making in and tak in the sheet even i have note plus tip for it to changed it'.. Imagine i need to keep on asking for them instead they do what they supposed to do for the guest.
40,Overall experience was good. I like the no smoking game area. Rooms were upkept but could have used a microwave and refrigerator. Staff were professional and courteous. Would be staying here again if the price us right.
40,Hotel is in a great location. Had an issue with the AC not working properly. Room was warm and smelled like cigarettes. Other than that no issues. Great hotel overall and would come back again in the future.
30,The view and the floor we stayed on was great the bathroom towels were tough and had stains on one of them. The hand towel look like it was used because a hand print was there. It look like snacks and water were sitting up there forever.
50,Great trip with the kids. Eataly was very yummy and catered to our food allergies. Skip Starbucks and go to the coffee shop In Eataly instead! Check-In was also a breeze with the app! We were able to go straight to our room after a long drive instead of waiting in a check in line!
30,We were excited about the 700 square foot Nightingale Suite but there was a lot of wasted space in the foyer when you first enter. The soap was small and the shower ceiling was too low. No room service for dinner on the weekdays and the breakfast was served with plastic and styrofoam. One restaurant ran out of what I thought was the best meal there fried shrimp and fish by 8pm even though they didn't close until 10pm The other restaurant Bettys Grille had such bad reviews we were afraid to go. We did peek in but not a sole was eating there so we decided against it. The line for the elevator on the higher floors was at least 30 people deep at night. The escalator at check out broke down and we had to carry our bags to the garage during checkout. The room did have two sitting areas and two tvs and was comfortable all in all and even though we didn't get the room view we wanted it was still pretty decent. The room was directly across from the elevator which we didn't like but we were so tired each night I don't think that was really a problem.
40,This is a solid hotel and a decent value. Very well located versus the other ends of the strip. Got a great rate so expectations were low. Chose the Nightingale Suite vs. the Atelier Suite at the NoMad. The NoMad was 50% more so this was a no brainer. Big room plenty of space decent bed. Definitely download the MGM Resorts app which you can use and completely avoid the lines for check in and out. Also you’ll have an electronic key which as long as your phone has service is helpful. Bathrooms were spacious but spare. Definitely don’t expect Wynn or Venetian kind of accoutrements.    I’d stay here again for convenience or simply value. Also it’s right next to the T Mobile Arena and walking distance to Allegiant Stadium.
50,"We popped in for a drink and to check out the advert ""nothing smokin' except the dice"". The smoke free casino was a very welcome change. We asked a security guard a out a nice bar. Hank Graae was so pleasant and showed us to a nice relatively quiet bar along the casino floor. We enjoyed his info on the cadino offerings. The bar was busy and bartenders likewise but ours took time to show us different bourbon selections. We'd go back if we weren't leaving tomorrow."
20,Our room could hear constant music playing from outside. Can also hear doors closing in the hall. Room was very basic and not as expected. TV setup was awkward to the side. Bathroom was small and nowhere to hang towels or washcloths.
40,Clean rooms. Non smoking is plus. Location is great  with tram access from the casino getting to middle of the strip is much easy. Didn’t need to take the car. Good food options. Rooms are clean and nice smelling.
20,The check in was awful I needed to change rooms 4 times before we found a room that wasn’t already occupied or had not been cleaned. The 3rd room was a king room and we needed 2 queens so I slept on a small pull out mattress.
10,Rooms are too high for small rooms with no microwave or refrigerator. They also need to be updated with phones and television to allow guests to watch different apps. Ex: Netflix Disney or HBO MAX. They didn't even have cable.
10,Was given a filthy room..No apology from the MLife Front Desk..gave me a key that doesn’t work ..again no apology …Room was given to me has a very foul odor ended up me coughing and was transferred again to another room and the safe was not working..EATALY staff were rude..
50,Extremely fun dealers are great food was fantastic. I went by myself to get away for about a day and a half and it was worth every second of it. I was very comfortable staff was amazing and put bosses were on top of everything.
30,The room corridors are dark the carpets are worn out. The room keys don't work most of the time had to go back to get new keys 4 times during the 2 nights we stayed there. Service fees are expensive for providing hardly any value.
50,I love this location. Very clean so many food options and located near a lot of shopping options. I was able to take tram to a few hotels. The tram ran until early morning which was so convenient. Will come back.
40,If you need to just unwind and taste good authentic Italian food this is the hotel. Amazing location as it is in the middle of the Strip and accessible to all stores. Plus side is you don't breathe all the smoke associated with most high end hotels. I will stay here again. Only thing is they should fix their parking card as every time we use it does not work.
50,We've stayed at the Park MGM several times. The hotel is new and everything works in the room. The white room walls look like they have been freshly painted and the artwork is creative and makes me think I'm at a private resort. Also it's near many great restaurants!
50,Rewards stay at Park MGM. First time at this property. Rooms are well appointed and comfortable. Could have used more bathroom counter space. Hotel was very busy but never experienced any delays other than Starbucks. Casino is excellent.
10,Given a handicap room even though we reserved room a month before. Was switched to 25th floor last room at the end of the hall to have to wait for 2 functioning elevators over 30 minutes each time. Rooms are subpar and ver noisy. Heard the window blinds open from both neighbors everyday. Next door people can be heard walls are paper thin.
40,Celebrated our twin sons turning 21 and I’ve stayed in most of the major hotels on the strip over the last 25 years. By far my most enjoyable trip to Vegas because I didn’t smell like smoke all day and all night didn’t inhale a casino full of smoke all night and my kids and wife were all able to get the gambling experience of Vegas in a clean air environment and not sitting next to someone blowing smoke in their face.    Rooms are adequate ..nothing over the top..but adequate. The Italian “Eataly” is also a very cool place for food and wine.
20,4 night stay to see a Raiders game. The hotel being smoke free is the only good thing about this place. Room was old carpet stained and reeked of old cigarettes blinds covered in a thick coat of dust. I was placed in an accessible room the bathroom floor flooded with water from the shower. Could hear every word from the folks in the room next to us. House keeping never showed up even after having called the front desk. Surely you can find better accommodation in Vegas.
40,Great hotel. Room very clean and great view of the strip. Don't recommend using virtual key on phone as it's not very effective for elevator use. Restaurants very good as well. Didn't visit pool but looked very appealing. Casino very small but smoke free is nice
30,If you’re unlucky you get someone in the room next to you (and if really unlucky you get both sides of you occupied) and then you get to listen to them all night. The walls are that thin!  Was a bit surprised there wasn’t coffee in the room. They also don’t have mini fridges in the rooms unless you order one for $35/nt.
30,Good location and smoke free was great! Food choices weren’t great. Front desk check in sub-par! Customer service so so. Front desk never gave any info about parking or resort amenities such as gym or wifi! Never told me that I can use my room key to get in and out and just pay $15 all night for in and out. I think I paid twice for parking in one day! Don’t know what the $39 resort fee per nights per room consist of. Front was not helpful or gave any efforts to accommodate my request for joining rooms! Rooms were very dusty! Shower was good cuz water pressure was great! Room noisy especially when the next room takes a shower I can hear the water thru the pipes!
50,This was a great get away brought my son who was very pleased with the service that game him I would recommend park MGM to everyone. The fact it is a smoke free place is great. Walking in the resort and not smelling cigarette was awesome.
50,Beautiful hotel will definitely come again the staff and the service was amazing and everyone was extremely helpful. The hotel was well managed and not to crowded and the Primrose restaurant was amazing
50,Room was close to the concert place so i chose it. Great staff. Too expensive as everything is now. Atleast parking was free for guests. Place was clean. You could hear the neighbors super easy. My friend complained about the configuration of wires on the wall. I was cool with everything. Nice shower
40,Great Hotel bathroom service and restaurants closed too early for me. I love the size of my room and the view. The staff was great. Everyone was helpful and friendly. Great location close to a lot of attractions in the strip.
20,The check in was not good the help next day was very poor the persons I talked to over the phone acted as if it was my fault I didn't get the correct room so after the phone calls to the desk I had to walk to the front desk and finally it was resolved
40,Nice place. Clean but needs more food options. Pay to park and 3 dollar vending machine water was the downside. Room was clean bathroom was nice. Decor a lil dated but was still nice hall was a lil dim though more lights would be good.
50,This was our first time staying at the Park MGM since it has been redone. We had stayed multiple times when it was Monte Carlo. We absolutely loved the atmosphere and the staff was incredibly friendly. The location is fantastic. I highly recommend Eataly especially the breakfast sandwiches and the coffee. We will definitely stay there again.
50,My first experience with Vegas security was fantastic. Thank you Brewster for helping to solve my problem and turn the night around. Also big thank you to the guy at the bell desk for helping me figure out options before approaching security. Y‘all are great.
40,The Park MGM is a great hotel. The rooms are newly renovated and very clean. Shower pressure was excellent! My room had a great strip view. Lots of different eating options. Primrose is fantastic and provided GREAT service. Have the bottomless mimosas if your plan on having more than two. The location is great not in the middle of the strip but close enough to get to everything.  Cons: the gym is small and could use an upgrade. Also if you are with a group in multiple rooms request staying on the same floor. If not you won't be able to go back and forth between each other's rooms.
40,It is our second stay at this resort comped to prevues stay tot is definitely went down.  If you prefer non smoking property this is the first one on the strip completely smoking free. Rooms clean enough but beds r not comfortable. Not enough storage space for clothing. Bathrooms very clean and water pressure is very good.
20,Experienced various issues from dirty and shower to insensitive staff.    On the day of arrival shower floor was visibly stained and shampoo tube was moldy.    After housekeeping came to clean up we found that the moldy shampoo tube was placed back into the shower.    When we were leaving after check out the parking attendant refused to allow us to contact the concierge and refused to have our reservation looked up and insisted we would have to pay via credit card in order to leave the structure. We explained that we had already paid in advance for parking when we checked in to the hotel. Attendant was unyielding refused to let us contact the concierge to look up our booking/payment and took our credit card.    Very dissatisfied.
50,Definitely will go back - it was wonderful not to smell smoke when walking thru the casino and no where else throughout the hotel. It was the first non-smoking casino I have ever been to and it was refreshing. The Eataly was awesome
30,Rooms are on the small side felt a little cramped. Odd use of the bathroom door as a closet door as well. Be aware that house keeping has set hours. This was not mentioned to me when I tried to order towels past 8 pm and the front desk was closed as well. It was an okay stay good location. Will I be back probably not.
50,I stayed here for 4 days. The hotel and casino were both spotless. The staff were all very friendly and made the stay a pleasure.    The fact that the entire property is non-smoking is a huge plus.    Best Friend BBQ and Primrose were both very delicious.
40,Very satisfactory room non smoking hotel I would have given 5 stars if not for the coffee shop at Eataly called Lavazza. Horrible service not caring crew behind the counter. Go to Starbucks across the street to New York New York.
50,Love the smoke free environment. Rooms are very clean and organized. We always stay at the Park MGM when we visit. Highly recommend it.  The room felt very clean I felt very comfortable and safe. Masks were provided all over the hotel as well as hand sanitizer and Clorox wipes. Is it access to the free tram going to the Aria and Bellagio. After going out we would just hop on the tram and end up close to our room.
30,It was a very small hotel room. There were noisy partyers next door and we were the ones that had to be inconvenienced and moved rooms at our expense. The were was no upgrade no complimentary offer of any sort for the inconvenience. The elevator waiting times to the rooms were super long as well. There was always a wait for the elevator.
40,We got away for a weekend and had a good time. We love that the casino is smoke-free it really makes everything much more pleasant. Rooms were clean and staff was friendly. Someone forgot to turn off their room's alarm so unfortunately we had to endure 30 min of an alarm at like 5AM before security came to shut it off. Nice proximity to the strip and other good hotels could do with another breakfast place that's not Starbucks or Eataly.    It did take a long time to ride the elevator each time. It seems like all the guests were on our set of floors so everyone had to wait to ride in the same elevator suite. I think Park should do a better job managing guest density. It was kinda absurd we had to wait 10 minutes once for an elevator!    Could also do with some 10 dollar tables too. Starting at 15? I'm going to have to start gambling elsewhere.
30,Rooms were nice. Wish there were fridges microwaves coffee makers etc. Electronic snack bar when accidentally knocked will be a charge to room. Cleaning Staff extremely nice and friendly. Slots odds were not friendly. Not enough Pai Gow tables. Food was meh but expensive.
30,I love that the property is smoke free. The Wi-Fi is pretty horrible. Justin at the front desk is great. The room was filled with dust and the shower/tub was tiny. When I booked I called and they said it was a shower separate from a soaking tub which was not accurate
50,The hotel room is very clean and spacious. I liked the fact that this is a no smoking environment and I am able to get fresh air without the smell of cigarettes. I enjoyed by stay here and I would definitely come back.
10,We decided to give a try going there for the holiday. But the room is dirty and even the tissue box was all wet. Unless you think the lotion fit your need...or I will suggest you choosing other hotels.. especially when they charged $40 for the resort fee
50,This is our first time staying at Park MGM it is a very clean and nice casino. We like the fact that it is smoke-free all the bars and restaurants on site are exceptional we thoroughly enjoyed our experience and will definitely come back
40,I Came and stayed at this casino for weekend of Christmas lots of restaurants and few stores. Pool and spa as well  Staff is great and friendly. Restaurants a bit pricey but great food and Starbucks also
40,This is a great hotel/casino if you are looking for smoke free. It’s so nice to breathe in the fresh clean air.  The rooms are updated and functional.  Housekeeping did an amazing job keeping our room clean & tidy.  The negative…if you are on the T-Mobile arena side you will hear music that is played in the courtyard 24/7. And if you are here when there is a Vegas Knights hockey game expect A LOT of noise that night. There was a loud DJ & a fog horn blowing.  Overall….we loved our stay here and will definitely be returning!!
50,The Park MGM is central on the strip and great walking to other hotels. Yummy new places to eat and the rooms are clean. Plus one of the only Casinos that does not allow smoking great perk! Parking was easy too.
50,We stayed at the Park MGM for the first time. Loved the rooms and the Casino was non-smoking. That is awesome. It was great to just go upstairs to our very nice room after the concert. We also had to check out a day early and there were no issues with payment.
40,Great comfy beds amenities should be better like coffee machine clocks at bedside. Rooms are average in size. Friendly staff. Was able to extend checkout for another hour. But otherwise okay stay. Add some extra stuff w the room
50,Highly recommend. Fun and very clean. The casino is the best. We love the location because we can get to anywhere on the strip. Restaurants are very nice would be betting they were all open in the early days if the week.
30,Room was cool for a short stay very basic outdated almost . Hallway is so dark and creepy but it’s manageable if you like basic rooms . I would stay again if doing 3 days anything longer I need the room with nice bathroom lol
40,A very pleasant stay! Very surprised of cleanliness and overall professionalism of all the staff. We always use the mobile application which was great! Room was very clean spacious and chic style. Casio was great and non smoking was awesome.
40,Nice location / not much food choice and they all closed early and coffee opened late when your on Fl time but overall nice place  3rd time staying there because we need multiple rooms and can't beat pricing or casino perks - location is where I can access multiple casino floors as well
30,Well situated on the Strip and with under advertised tram to Bellagio. Rooms are ok but no microwave mini fridge or coffee maker. Front desk not helpful in getting adjoining rooms (can't do in advance wasn't available at check in). Very limited cable package for down time in the morning with the kids.
50,Park MGM is a good place to stay when in Vegas. The staffs are helpful and treat customers with respect. I like Part MGM because the price is reasonable and the location is close to the strip. Also the casino is clean and offers various of drink. The overall service is excellent.
40,The park mgm was nice. I feel like the accessible nighthawk suite was a little dated. I don’t think I would stay in the accessible suite again. It was offered as an upgrade at check in. We did enjoy the eatly it had a great food options. The cream puffs were amazing. Overall a nice experience.
50,Park MGM was very clean with friendly staff. It is also a non-smoking casino / hotel which a bonus to us. Our standard room with one king-size bed is roomy. Eatalay is a cute area with Italian street flare. Aria is a 7 min short walk via inside walkway. We have a good stay.
50,We enjoy staying at this hotel. It is no-smoking and that makes a difference. Also the Co-Vid protocols are strictly followed. Felt very safe. We attended the Bruno Mars concert. The venue was great from every seat.
50,"Fantastic location . Easy access to the t mobile arena and other resorts. Very friendly and to top it off was completely smoke free. Found my new ""go to"" resort when in Vegas. You don't even have to wait in line to check in. Just download the mlife app and your room and key will be found"
40,Loved everything about this place except that you cannot smoke anywhere on the premise. The Eataly section has some extremely good Italian good. Highly recommend if your a non smoker. We just went to hotel next door to gamble.
50,My Christmas Vacation at Park MGM was absolutely wonderful as always. Friendly staff great customer service and major wins on the slots. Bavette’s Steakhouse was elegant and delicious. We love staying here and the biggest reason we come here is because it is smoke free.
10,The room we booked was not yet ready at our 9:30 pm check in. We were put in two different dirty rooms before finally sleeping in a third room for the night at going on midnight and moving hotels the next morning. Carpet in the rooms was dirty. Hallway carpets are puckered and dirty looking. One of our rooms had a dirty face mask left behind used soap at the sink/shower and urine/toilet paper in the toilet unflushed. I would not recommend this property at all.
40,Overall Park MGM is a solid location to stay. The rooms are fine for the stay in between Luxor and Bellagio bedding standards. Needs a fridge or something in the rooms. The Casino was so so not a large one and didn't pay out enough to make the gambling fun to stick around.
40,It was good. Not as good as other hotels I have stayed at in Vegas but I did appreciate it that it was smoke free. The restaurants were ok with the exception of their steak house. That was amazing! Thanks
50,Had a great stay at the Park MGM. The room was clean with all essentials. It had a cute and cozy feel. I really like the acces to the parking lot and how easily I was able to find parking and get out. It's very close to the t-mobile arena..
50,We had an awesome stay at Park MGM! All the restaurants were delicious!! On The Record had great DJs and we partied til it closed! We especially loved that the casino was smokeless! We would definitely stay here again!
50,If you're visiting Las Vegas for a sporting event or concert at T-Mobile Arena Park MGM is the place to be. Right across the street from the arena tons of restaurants things to see/do etc. Great place to stay! We also saw Bruno Mars at the in-house Dolby Theater which is an awesome venue. Intimate but not small. That show was the best concert I've ever been to and we couldn't have phones so we just enjoyed the concert and lived in the moment. This is my second stay at Park MGM (whenever UNC plays in Vegas I stay there).
50,Had a 3-night stay. Room was comfortable if not slightly ordinary with all the basic amenities you expect. Loved that the hotel and casino were smoke-free and there were several food options surrounding the casino. Also a direct walkway to Aria. Friendly staff at the check-in desk.  The only negative encounter I had was during an event at the nearby T-Mobile Arena; while I was attempting to drive into the ParkMGM self-parking garage I encountered some very hostile traffic conductors who assumed everyone entering the parking lot was there for the event when all I wanted was to park and get to my hotel room for the night.  Otherwise this is a solid hotel and casino.
50,We decided to take a very short vacation and choose to stay at the Park MGM. It was a GREAT decision. Clean room great strip view and very friendly staff. Will definitely be booking again next year. 100% recommend!
50,It was a mother-daughter birthday trip to see Bruno Mars. We stayed because the theater was there and didn't know anything about the hotel but will now stay there in the future. Loved the place - so classy. Dark wood classy speakeasy vibe. Friendly staff.
30,We have stayed here times before but this time majority of what we experienced was a huge struggle and a challenge. We couldn’t sleep due to loud noises. The room was hot no matter how much we tried to turn the ac on. The parking situation was always a mess going in & out of the structure. We felt harassed by security about mask mandates & we felt like we couldn’t even enjoy our drinks because they would come up to us to tell us to put the mask back on when we would finish sipping out drinks when we know the rules. The pizza in Eataly was not good either and we loved that place. When I asked for a new piece they gave me pretty much bread and was really annoyed. I don’t know what happened but this is the not the Park MGM I remembered coming to
50,We were in Vegas for a basketball game. Perfect location. Clean and comfortable room. Friendly and helpful staff. Had great meals and saw David Copperfield show which was awesome! Hope to come back again.
30,I got the nightingale suite for my birthday. The size of the room was nice and it fit 8 people nicely. However there were some flaws about the room. There was previous trash in the trash can from the last guest and the parking situation was a nightmare. The pull out couch mattress also kept sinking in the middle. Other than that the room was just average.
50,The best service and very clean staff always friendly and smiles and the best things is no smoking inside the hotel and I like the shopping place who ever is working very good people I like there service and the restaurant the best food and clean
40,We enjoyed our stay. We stayed 4nights and would have liked a little storage for our clothes. We liked the smoke free environment. The casino is nice. The location is very good. Plenty of access to other MGM properties. We would not hesitate to stay there again .
40,I enjoyed the smoke free environment and the hotel is cute and mostly clean they also have comfortable beds but beyond that there is nothing too special. No in room mini bar simple showers and vanity spaces simple décor. Overall I would stay again because it's well located and has great food options.
50,If you dislike cigarette smoke this is your new favorite Vegas hotel. Absolutely beautiful decor. Great casino. Friendly friendly staff. Gorgeous rooms. Wonderful restaurants. This place has it all. And their fantastic security makes you feel safe and they keep out the riff raff. All this and reasonably priced. Try it out. We loved it.
50,"We stayed for my daughter's 30th birthday trip. The staff was very helpful and friendly. The location was good - not the ""center"" of the strip but very convenient to all. Bruno Mars was playing so it was packed! We had a great time."
50,This inexpensive hotel had the amenities of a 5 star resort. The rooms were pretty bare bones but who goes to Vegas to stay in the room. With all of the amenities in the hotel no need to walk the strip.
50,If you are a non smoker this is the only place to stay in Vegas  Not only that the entire staff was excellent  Love Love this property it is well maintained with lots of food options when you have Eataly on site yum
50,Great Rooms Comfy & Clean. Awesome Gambling !! Amazing food at Eataly !!! Perfect location on the Las Vegas Strip. Very Close to T Mobile Arena and economical prices. We loved this place !!! Won lots of money too…. The best time here. I only wish they had a refrigerator in the room for the leftover food that we devoured at Eataly and at Bavetts steak House. Keep up the great work!!
50,Great place to stay with air you can breathe. The room was comfortable and the service was great. Clean room great shower comfortable bed. Who could ask for anything more. Easy to get to other casinos using the tram.
50,Nice hotel good location and a smoke free environment. Most important is the smoke free casino. We will definitely be back. Plenty of good eating options such as Eatlaly - on premises. And just across the street is Nacho Daddy's for a fantastic breakfast.
50,My sisters and i enjoyed the rooms we were in. I loved the large shower and the comfort of the beds. I love the location of the hotel walking distance to a lot if the strip attractions. I will most definitely return.
30,The location is good if you want to attend an event at T Mobile Arena or Dolby Theater. The Eatily food court is amazing. But…the rooms are small and have no drawers! None. You are left having yo place your clothes on the couch. The bathrooms are very small.
20,Room was small very noisy poor layout many better options on the strip. Casino and Eataly were great. Non-smoking was great. Casino just the right size inviting non-intimidating atmosphere. Not likely to stay in hotel again. Very likely to return to casino and Eataly.
50,We just returned from our 3rd stay at the Park MGM. We really like the hotel; it is close to lots of shopping and restaurants. You really don't need to leave the property for good food though. We could have spent every day in Eataly! It's so fun to walk around and visit the various vendors. We also enjoyed Primrose Lala Noodle and Bavette's. The rooms are clean and spacious staff is helpful and friendly. We love that we can just walk downstairs through the casino to see our show at the Dolby Live Theater. Can't wait to go again!
50,Right in the center of the Las Vegas Strip. The tram to Bellagio is very helpful and Eataly is a nice choice for meals and snacks. Everyone at the resort was exceptionally friendly and I felt my business was appreciated.
50,If you are looking for a great place to visit in Las Vegas with great staff and excellent rooms stay at the Park MGM. The casino is non smoking and makes for a more comfortable experience and easy on the eyes. Starbucks is great sometimes busy but good. Intertainment is top shelf (Bruno Mars).
40,This is my second stay at the Park. Previous stay was during remodeling of the building approximately 2 1/2 yrs ago. The hotel lobby and restaurant areas especially the italian eatery area have a lot of choices to eat. With the ez access to the strip it is very convenient. I would recommend this hotel due to its central location.
50,I've been in Vegas several times this particular one was very good experience  Excelente pays off for the slots. Kind personal. My friends 4 of them was their first time visiting are agreed about the excellent service.  No to exited about the rooms very little no coffee maker or fridge.
40,Great Location  Non-smoking Casino  Great Restaurants  Great variety of food and clubs  Rooms are a bit small and closet door and bathroom share same door which means one is always open; there are no refrigerators microwaves or Keurig coffee machines; but other than that you cannot beat location especially if you’re attending an event in the arena.
50,My friends and I stayed at Park MGM to attend basketball games and hockey at T-Mobile. The rooms were very modern updated and clean. The casino smelled great and there was no smoke. The hotel is very close to everything and the staff were very friendly and helpful.
50,I had initially booked my stay at The Mirage but after one night I checked out because of the smoking. A waitress at The Mirage told me about this place and immediately fell in LOVE that this hotel and casino is NON-SMOKING! Should I come back to Vegas I will only stay here.
10,Sadly disappointed at the quality of this hotel. We love MGM but it's the Grand the park is at the quality of Motel 6. No cups in room no coffee pot cheap makeup mirror on wall not usable blow dryer the cheapest made. Room smelled funky and was very drab. The pictures on the wall were just weird and odd for a hotel room. Almost forgot the bed was like sleeping on a pull out sofa I give them two thumbs down 👎 👎 . And again I'm an MGM FAN but say your money and go elsewhere. We were here December 17-20th 2021  Also note: alcohol and food prices have either doubled or tripled due to COVID so a small can of beer is $15 a simple Coke is $7 so anywhere you go everything has went way up in cost and we go yearly so very noticeable
50,Clean spacious well appointed room very quiet except if you have an adjoining room. I recommend getting a room without the passage door to next door unless of course it’s shared with friends or family. Great location and attentive staff.
50,This hotel is not only a great value but has many great options for restaurants pet friendly clean and fantastic location. I will stay here 9 times out of 10 when I travel to Vegas. The theatre has top billing acts like Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars.It never disappoints!
10,The room looked nothing like how it was portrayed on the website. The site shows a chic room with a green and white design throughout. My room was blood red. It truly looked awful and disgusting. The room was dirty and missing basic amenities that should have been there. I brought this attention to hotel staff including a manager the night of my arrival. Their response was one of indifference. Really disappointing stay.
30,Room was dirty. Toilet seat was not cleaned. Coffee table was dirty and sticky. There was also a broken plastic piece that was just sitting in the room. Didn’t know where it went. Just a broken part laying around on the counter ledge.
50,I have stayed at 3 different properties in Vegas and Park MGM is my favorite. Great food good video poker and great casino hosts. The free play and comps are great and keep me coming back. I highly recommend this hotel/casino.
50,MGM park was perfect! Everything from check in check out the easiness of everything the housekeeper casino the dealers sports book everything was easy and perfect. I’ve been coming to Vegas for 24 years. Can’t wait to come back and stay at MGM park!
50,I loved staying at Park MGM. They have clean rooms very vice staff and great food venues. I especially loved the Eataly an Italian venue with food and wine. Very nice place. I will definately stay here again!
40,If you get a room that over looks the t-mobile area and park area be advised that the music will be left on overnight and may be an issue for you to sleep. View was amazing people great hotel room comfy - beds and pillows!    Oh - we were Charged $45 / night service fee so that was not fun.
50,Nice hotel. Stringent with mask mandate which I appreciated. Not all restaurants were open. They are very very dog friendly. Casino was decent.our favorite restaurant was the only one open for breakfast. Starbucks always has a long line but moved quickly.
40,If you are looking for the bare basics this is the room for you. Clean and has what you need if you are not spending much time in your room which honestly that’s the point of coming to Las Vegas right? But wait no frig? Ok. Nice bathroom with great water pressure. No separate tub. Plenty of towels. Decent mattress to sleep on. I love that you can check in online and use a digital key on your phone. It worked great on my room door—not so much in the elevator. I did not like the lighting in the hallways to the rooms. Dark and a little creepy for a long hallway. Casino was as expected. Be sure and browse through Eataly particularly the pastry and coffee shop. Amazing!
10,Awful. The room needs a deep cleaning. And don't put someone who is not handicap in a handicap room. I have stayed at some places in vegas that weren't the nicest but the rooms were clean. I shod of stayed somewhere else but I was going to t mobile arena. I would never stay here again. I love mgm properties but this one was disappointing.
50,Any issues were resolved immediately. Front desk personnel were great.  Moblie key needs a closer look.  Good value  Best Friends Eataly and LaLa Noodle were great . Non smoking a bonus. Gambling area great
40,We like the hotel and it’s location. Our King room had a walk in shower which we greatly liked and appreciated. Mattress felt lumpy and didn’t provide the best of sleep. Staff was helpful when needed but signs about checking in and printing keys could be a bit larger.
50,I have stayed here twice and really enjoy the modern and comfortable room. Great bed and bathroom offer excellent value for money comfort-wise. Being a smoke-free hotel is an attraction as well. The hotel has good but not great food options. However you are a short walk to the Aria as well as being adjacent to the strip where there are plenty of other options if you like. I will stay here again for sure.
50,What a great hotel this is smoke free and very clean and easy to navigate. The restaurants were very easy to make reservations and the guest rooms are extremely clean and inviting. I would highly recommend this property.
50,Had a 3-day stay at the Park MGM. Had been wanting to stay here for awhile for the central location clean casino and proximity to the ABC store for supplies. Check-in experience was extremely efficient at the desk (just wish MGM could figure out the smartphone keys to make it that much quicker). Self check-out worked great.
50,Location Eataly Friendly Staff in the Casino (worker from the Bronx assisting me on the Slots pool hostess & Bartenders and the instructor teaching us how to play craps)! An amazing experience had by all!
10,The walls were paper thin. We asked for a quiet room and there was constant music from the outside. I would never stay there again and I am going to tell everyone I know not to stay here. Also the receptionist Lashonda was very unhelpful when we asked for help with noisy neighbors. The people next door were yelling and playing music very loud from midnight to past 1am. I asked for a supervisor and I never heard from one. Terrible service.
50,Great property for the price. Being in a smoke-free environment is wonderful. It’s close to other MGM properties and there are enough amenities for me. I took advantage of the spa this time. My facial was fantastic and the use of the jacuzzi and sauna was an added bonus.
10,Rude employees dirty room no towels no Kleenex no shampoo no soap no toilet paper. Paid for parking on our room but after 4 requests we still could not use our room key to enter or exit the garage.
50,We hadn't been to Vegas in years so we decided to go this December. The hotel is in a central location on the strip close to the MGM Bellagio etc. and close to the airport and the tram station. We ate at three of the Hotel restaurants including the Eataly and Roy Choi's restaurant Best Friend. The food was very good to excellent.  The Hotel is non smoking and the casino is the only nonsmoking casino on the strip.The rooms were very nice.    We definitely will stay here on our next visit
30,The room looked nothing like what was represented on-line. The hallways were extremely dark. Bathroom amenities were lacking. Location was amazing. Eataly provided great dining selections snd the entertainment was great.
30,The hotel itself is awesome and quite nice. Very beautiful finishings. Comfortable bed. Very nice bath and shower. Access to T-Mobile is amazing. However because of its proximity to T-Mobile arena you could hear the music from the T-Mobile Square all night long. It never stopped. Worst night sleep ever.
50,This hotel is the only hotel on the strip that is smoke free which is great for people who don't smoke or get tired of the smell of smoke(cigarettes or weed) the room could of had more closet space there was only 4 little drawers for your clothes. With 2 people( one being a woman) that was not enough space.
40,This was more than what anyone can ask for. Hotel was close to the strip and not very crowded. Great atmosphere and dining was great. Stayed here for 4 days and would change a thing. Only problem was my sink drained slow called front desk fixed same day.
50,We attended the 2021 NFR with some friends and this hotel was perfect for us! We don’t like smoke and like clean. The Eataly “village” food area was very good. Most of all you didn’t feel like crap due to inhaling second hand smoke which made our stay very enjoyable.
40,Great clean rooms nice casino. I thought EATITALY was overpriced and overrated. Nice location had a great time. The tables stakes were a little high$15min. Nice center bar and staff at check in was very helpful. Would recommend the King rooms very clean and comfortable
50,The Park was very nice and the staff was very friendly. Our room was a suite and I was very pleased by the size cleanliness of our room and our beds were very comfortable. In all We were very pleased with our stay and I would return. Thank you again!
30,The rooms weren’t that great. It just seemed like a box with a bed in it. The hotel seemed like a band aid to the previous Monte Carlo casino. I got my rate through Vegas slots which im glad I did. I would never pay regular price for this hotel.
40,Location is ideal in the center of the strip and directly across from T Mobile Arena. Room was very clean only lacked a mini fridge. Staff were extremely courteous during check in and throughout the hotel.
50,Loved it as it was relaxing!!!  Awesome as a NON SMOKING HOTEL!!!  FOOD @ EATALY was an experience worth telling others.  My face food was the scallop skewers and the humongous pizza slices with artichokes & sausages!!!!
40,Staff was friendly and helpful. The central location made travel easy to all strip and the t mobile arena. I didn’t like the digital key and the room could have had more blankets. I will recommend to friends and would stay again.
40,This hotel is good as it right next to T Mobile Arena and has easy access to the stores on the Strip. You don't feel isolated or like you you have a limited amount of options for meals. The walls are quite thin though and you can definitely hear the room next door which isn't good.
10,No restaurants or snack shops were open after a concert. Had to go across the street to find food at 11pm. The room was dated and needed a refresh. The hallways smelled awful. Could hear the music from the club on the floor below. Wouldn’t recommend staying here.
50,Everything about my trip was wonderful the service was wonderful I am so looking forward to coming back soon💯. I've shared my experience with all my family and friends everyone loves the post everyone loves the views that I've been too...and I can't wait to come back
40,Comped room. Zero view. I guess you get what you pay for. Still think I overpaid considering the “resort” fee. Hallway carpet on 4th floor were dirty. Elevator and room cards restricting access to other floors made it impossible to visit friends and family in the hotel. Very annoying “security” feature.
50,There really are no good words to describe this destination. Think the best comments are location location location. There are really no reasons to leave the property. This destination stimulates all of the senses. There is food drink gaming atmosphere. The room was stunning with a wonderful view from 35 floors up. Always a grand experience. Staff is accommodating.
50,Center of the Strip and close to everything. Eataly is such a wonderful option for fantastic food without reservations or a second mortgage to pay for the meal. Best Friend was honestly the best meal we had while we were there (we also ate at Spago and Bevettes so this is a major compliment). And it is SO NICE to not have to worry about sitting at the black jack table with Sally and her Virginia Slims blowing smoke in your face. Rooms are nice and modern. We have stayed everywhere from the Wynn to Luxor and Park MGM is the best value on the strip.
20,Customer Service and client facing staff should have a personality suited to their position. Maybe even seem like they are enjoying their work. It’s weird to deal with social awkward staff while seeking a certain experience. Rooms were great! Clean! I found a few dealers to play with over my 3 days. Play tracking wasn’t accurate but where is it on the strip
40,I stayed at Park MGM for a business conference.  Loved the easy check-in room was clean Casino is non smoking!    Only downside was the app to use your phone for elevator access and room entry was faulty the wifi wasn't strong enough for phone to hook into. Recommend getting old fashioned key
50,The hotel is very nice I like the addition of Eataly! Lala noodle is also a very good spot to eat. I feel the best decision that MGM made was to make this a smoke-free property! Was badly needed on the strip. You don't come out of there smelling like an ash-tray. The room was nice and bed was comfortable.
20,"Not the welcome back to Vegas we hoped for. Old dark room w/ tiny bottles of mismatched shampoo/conditioner no body wash no wash cloths1 towel for 2 people for 2 nights. It gave Super 8 Motel vibes. To charge a ""resort fee"" for that alone felt cheap. The room was dark and dingy and the hall the same. The check in clerk couldn't be bothered to answer questions or even extend information about the food credit and free play we were offered. We had to go back to the front desk later when we remembered we had it and ask how to redeem it. We've stayed here many times before we stopped due to the pandemic and were shocked at how service has just tumbled below any standard. I get that everyone is short staffed and thus we would never dream of making someone's day harder than it is but that goes both ways. If the Park MGM does have employees (which they did) then they need to be trained properly in customer service. It seems like no one trains employees to offer assistance anymore. I am the one having to reach out for the basics such as 1 more towel or how to get a credit that was offered to me as part of a welcome back package. It was a cold unfriendly experience. Maybe the managers can contact Chick-Fil-A and ask how they train their staff to be friendly and helpful?"
10,If you want filthy rooms (someone else's hair in your shower pee on the floor next to toilet dirty sink and soap dish dirty door handle on bathroom door) loud music until all hours of the night movie cutting off in the middle well this is the place to stay. Only good thing was it is a NO smoking hotel and casino.
40,Overall the hotel is great; rooms are modern spacious and clean. The hallways that lead to the guest rooms look too dark and makes it look dingy. I suggest more lighting to solve this or maybe repainting the hallways a different color though this may be more expensive
40,Park MGM is great place to stay. The only totally non smoking casino in Vegas. Plenty of Casino within walking distance. Rooms are modern and we had a nice view from the 28th floor. We will stay there again.
50,The casino has comfortable beds great staff and terrific amenities. A smoke free casino makes it easy to breathe and have a great time even with a mask on. The casino is right on the strip with easy access to all the shows and fun offered on the Las Vegas Strip.
50,We always appreciate the smoke free environment which is not the norm in Vegas. The front desk staff were very helpful and patient as they accommodated us on short notice. We've started at Park MGM a few times and would definitely come back.
50,Everything was great staff dealer hosts food. My only complaint is that when the casino is busy there seems to be a music competition of who can be the loudest casino music or the venues. I have been visiting this property for over 10 years
40,We stayed here because it is a nonsmoking property. We were upgraded to a view room on the 28th floor. The room was nice but not elegant. As other reviewers note no refrigerator although they offered to bring one up. Mask mandate was strictly enforced. This is a pricey place to gamble. park or eat but we splurged on Eatily for pizza which was great. Valet parking is free for gold level or higher MGM customers.and the staff there were great.
50,Cool place to visit connected to the hottest area of the strip. The food was outstanding. If you stay there it’s walking distance to everything. The tram can take you to almost all the other casinos one side of the strip until you want to visit the ones on the other side of the street and they are easy to get to by crossing the bridge.
50,We came to town to drag race but that turned into a bust But Vegas gave us a great time for family and friends to get together. Getting lucky at the gambling helped also. We came home winners all the way around. Thank you Las Vegas for a great time! We hope to be back soon and will stay again at the Park MGM
50,Love this hotel - Staff is always helpful and polite - Rooms are clean - Cocktail waitresses were attentive and pleasant. Casino wasn’t too crowded - Hotel enforced the mask mandate  which I appreciated - I wish restaurants were opened earlier
50,Nice hotel clean technology friendly check in and out on the MGM phone app. Sports betting kiosk that is close to the elevator bank on the main floor. Everything was perfect and the staff was friendly and accommodating.
50,A much needed trip in November to Vegas we stayed at the Park MGM and the highlights of this hotel are:  1. IT IS SMOKE FREE - this is huge for us as it is for many others you dont wake up in the morning with red eyes and a scratchy throat…at least not from smoke!  2. This hotel has EATLY - fabulous Italian food right at your finger tips. Everything we had to eat here was delicious. The prices are average for Vegas but well worth it!  3. Very clean rooms casino and pool area - with extremely friendly staff and really great service.    Overall the Park MGM is definitely a hotel that we would go back to again and again!
40,This was our 1st trip to. Park MGM and we were very happy with the entire experience there. From a great check in experience to our final departure (3 nights total) we had a great time and no complaints. My wife and I had not been to Vegas in 6 years but after this trip to the “Park”we are already discussing a return trip to this resort.
50,Love this hotel; it's in a great location for connecting to other hotels via tram or monorail. The rooms are wonderful love the safe but did not like the fact they've taken out the refrigerators (great if you have family with you). Love the comps they offer.
50,Excellent costumer service friendly very attentive room are super clean reasonable price my first time in this hotel and I really love it 🥰 I enjoy my time casino are nice and clean and more important NO smoking 🚭
30,Resort was very nice and non-smoking. Staff was friendly. Unfortunately could hear music playing from outside the whole time we were there which made it hard to get to sleep at night. I guess don't get a room facing T-Mobile. Our friends were on the other side and couldn't hear anything. Would probably give another try but ask for a different room location.
30,room was ok but lacking any amenities other than t.v. not even coffee maker for whe you wake up.no cups in bathroom.small drawers in closet but no chest of regular size drawers for clothes.prices on any food items sky high!
30,This spot was pretty good overall. The issue is the deposit is $300 plus parking at $15 per day and other fees it’s a bit pricey. I think paying for a resort fee during the winter is not good. The room service is only available until like 2 pm or something like that. The best part is the distance to the concert venue! Perfect walk and no driving or extra expense for that.
20,The room mattress was like a worn futon. No box spring just the plywood frame. Not much for in-room amenities. Not even coffee. App didn't work for check-in and didn't get a notification that the room was ready for our early arrival added fare.
40,Everything about Park MGM is very good. Perfect for a regular visit to LV. Dont expect the extraordinary Wynn or Bellagio experience but it has everything you need smack in the middle of the strip and fits a quick LV getaway perfectly.. Clean rooms great food good service and non smoking
10,This hotel has no Covid policy. They say they have a mask policy but guests and employees were walking around without masks. We also experienced a domestic violence issue at the room next to ours and the front desk did nothing. The rooms were cheap but now we know why.
50,Nice comfortable bed easy check in easy parking garage the only downside was there is no refrigerator and ac can’t keep up with heat in room until night time great casino and aria us connected and they have real card Texas hold ‘em
10,Found that my room's toilet had been used and not flushed before I could ever use it. Ask for refund for next few days I was supposed to stay there... They say ok no charges will be made. Then they charge me. Just all lies...
50,We stayed at the ParkMGM because we had a concert at Dolby Live. The room was nice and housekeeping did a great job. We also like that it is walking distance to the T-mobile arena. We will stay here again
30,Great Wellness Room but Terrible Front desk staff even before arrival and rude and aggressive Baccarat Dealer in the high limit room with female gambler only not the men. Spoke to Mgmt on both but no real concessions.
50,This was our first visit to Park we had a great time rooms were nice casino size was just right food was good and employees were all friendly and professional. Thank you to Steve A. and Rob G. for a fun and entertaining night at the black jack table. You both made us laugh and most importantly-we won! Best of luck and we will be back!
50,This hotel is the perfect size and I love the non smoking environment. I love a hotel where you don't walk 5 minutes from the elevator to your room. Plenty of restaurants close by too! The casino is a good size too!
10,The room was on the higher price end for the strip so we expect a very clean nice stay upon check in the floor in the room was sticky and sheets were stained and dirty there our much nicer options for much cheaper on the strip. I will not be returning to stay at this hotel
50,My girlfriend and I enjoyed a smoke-free casino and hotel experience at the MGM Park. We had visited other casinos but were turned off by the smoky environment. We continue to return to the MGM Park for the clean atmosphere and lucky slots! Also the Primrose Restaurant has the best eggs benedict breakfast to start the day!!
50,A smoke free hotel is the very best to stay in and Park MGM is the best. Rooms are great and the showers are bigger than normal. The shower head is so awesome that you enjoy your shower. Maid service is also great. Room always clean upon returning. Highly recommend a stay here! Restaurants in the hotel are top notched. And Starbucks coffee every morning.
50,We initially picked this location because of price and it appeared to have easy access when moving from the parking garage to our room without having to pass through the casino. This was important since we have two young sons and one has asthma. The bonus was arriving their to learn it was a non-smoking facility. I had not been to Las Vegas since 2013 and was unaware of any non-smoking locations in existence. Definitely will stay their again
50,Check-in was effortless with the app and digital key. The rooms were spacious and new compared to other MGM properties. We very much enjoyed ourselves and will be back indefinitely. Go find the BetMGM bar and have a drink or two with a burger & some sweet potato fries you won’t be disappointed.
50,We stayed at park MGM The no smoking was a great feature this location has! The front entrance has Eataly which has an amazing wine selection. The location was convenient with MGM Grand in walking distance as well as New York New York! MGM is the king of Vegas and all of their properties show it!
40,If your going to a hockey game this is the place to stay. You just walk across the street and your out of the hustle ans bustle if you want to relax or get ready for a night on the town! Also no smoking is amazing!!
40,I stayed here for a girls weekend in December on a MyVegas two night reward. We all LOVED the main floor and casino areas. The Lady Gaga costume museum was fun the food at Best Friend is phenomenal and Primrose was a solid breakfast joint. Oh! And the Juniper Lounge served excellent cocktails! Where this hotel fell short were the rooms. We were underwhelmed by the decor and sparse layout. The lamp make the room feel like a cheap motel 6 and there was no mini fridge. Next time we're going to try another place on the Strip.
40,Clean spacious rooms friendly staff excellent location on the strip. Great venue for concerts at the Dolby theater and a very short walk to T Mobile arena for hockey or other events. Check in and out as about as easy as possible!
50,First my first time every expectation was met with flying colors. We had a great experience overall exceptional convention center staff catering waiters were the highlight of our stay. I would definitely recommend and return again.
50,This was our first trip to Las Vegas and the Park MGM is a great choice to stay at if it is your first time. The room rates are budget friendly compared to the other hotels in the area. The location is not directly in the middle of the strip but is close enough that we were able to walk to all the free attractions with no problems. And if anything did seem too far the Aria Express (tram) that connects Park MGM Aria and Bellagio is very convenient free and easy to use. The staff at the Park MGM are friendly and courteous; always greeting you no matter how busy they seem. Our mornings would start off in Eataly which was very convenient. Lala Noodle asian fusion noodle restaurant was very good; not too pricey but on the higher end compared to eateries in your local strip mall. The wife and I decided that Park MGM would be our Vegas home every time we visit because they made our first experience in Vegas perfect. Dont forget to join Mlife to gain rewards!
50,Friendly and helpful staff. Clean and quiet room. Best thing is a non smoking casino. Easy mobile check in and out. Hotel is located right across the Tmobile arena which was great since we were going to watch a UFC event.
50,I loved my stay at the Park MGM. The casino isn’t the largest but the amenities restaurants and staff more than make up for that. The resort is smoke free! I loved the old Vegas/Hollywood vibes the decor presented. It’s cool to see MGM take an older property and completely reimagine it without it loosing its past. Will definitely stay again. Rooms were spacious and staff was excellent.
30,I was encountered and I recommended to a lousy host I cashed over $20000 at MGM casinos and he did not Kompass anything I am a regular gambler at MGM Detroit Every casino I ever been has been very accommodating and I had fantastic rooms add other casinos and I was really disappointed buy this host Ryan
30,What can I say. The casino was just your average Casino. There are a few places to eat in the hotel. Most noteworthy is Eatily! The hallways though. If you’ve got the room at the end pack your flashlight and crumbs for the hike back. Put some lights in the darn things. Sadly we couldn’t get 3 rooms on the same floor with our kids. Due to this it makes it harder to plan and make sure they are getting ready. I’m guessing due to COVID you can’t have coffee in your rooms. But you can either go stand in line at Starbucks in the lobby with 50 other non-Covid patients or walk 3/4 of a mile to Eatily. Raise your beds and put coffee and fridges back in the rooms. Nice hotel but not for us ever again.
30,AC was messed up. Our room also didn't have a mini fridge for our drinks nor did I see an ice machine. Told front desk about our AC problem and we never saw a change. Probably won't be returning to this place on our next trip.
50,Great shower head clean rooms and hotels good food in location. Try Eatally breakfast lunch and dinner. Starbucks on site. Comfortable beds and great bedding. Good location to all and only 10 minutes from the airport
50,Hotel is nice clean and convenient. Staff is friendly and helpful.  It's close to other Hotels and Casinos and makes it easy to walk to site see. Overall very nice. I love that you can check in and out from your phone.
50,Beautiful hotel and great restaurants! host was great everything is layed out in a great way. easy to get from room to casino to places to eat. would highly recommend staying at park mgm for your next trips.
30,Great location for concerts. Rooms are old and tired looking with no amenities. Tried for room service but waited for 10 minutes on hold. Perfect to stay for concerts but don't expect anything from the room.
50,I have have stayed in multiple hotels across the strip but never have stayed at Park MGM. Decided to stay the week here for 3 Golden knights games since it was convenient to access as its across the street. Hotel was also very easy to go further down the strip with the use of the free tram. The atmosphere is a bit more calmer than most hotels which can sometimes be a good thing but can change during game days as expected. Overall had a great time here and would recommend.
10,When I first checked in my room hasn’t been cleaned yet. There were still towels on the floor and trash in the room. Sheets had a stain. Staff was unhelpful. The line for Starbucks took 25 mins. Really basic hotel.
30,We had to change rooms right away due to a horrible smell....the digitized key access for floors and room access was rough at best......then my father had to be rescued from a stuck elevator......a few staff members really helped us out and that made a real difference!
50,When planning your trip to Vegas try the Park MGM! Very clean perfect location-right in the middle of it all! I've stayed there several times - always want to go back there! If you're planning on attending an event of concert at T-Mobile it's the perfect spot to stay-right next door! The beds are to die for!!!!
50,Great location awesome bed Eataly is fantastic smoke free environment including casino. Friendly staff is very helpful bell staff is always accommodating to your needs. I’ll be staying at Park MGM from now on when visiting Las Vegas.
50,This was our second time staying at The Park MGM. It’s lovely! Rooms are super clean and spacious. The bed and pillows were all very comfy. The restaurants especially Bavette’s steak house were all delicious with excellent service. Primrose has a lovely leisurely feel which is perfect for breakfast. We have definitely made this our go-to hotel in Vegas
30,Carpet cleaning j hallways were dirty sheets did not have smell clean up there was an odor in room smelled horrible I asked rlhouse keeper for deodorizer for smell towels were hard not soft at all. To dark 🕶️ n hallway
50,Best place I have ever stayed! Clean bathroom and the water pressure was amazing! Super comfy bed as well! I definitely enjoyed the pool and the jacuzzi even on a rainy day. We will definitely stay here again!
40,The hotel was nice great location. Right next to T-Mobile Arena. Staff was friendly easy check in. Bell Desk was very helpful with wheelchair rentals. The room was nice but not suitable for a person on crutches or a wheelchair it was cluttered. Not my restaurant selections to choose from there. Primrose bar had terrible service and drinks not worth the price.
50,Good food clean rooms and showers. Great service from staff! Comfy beds! Good selection of games and services to choose from. Staff was helpful and offered help even when not asked. I would recommend MGM Park to all my friends and family!
40,Great hotel and casino if you don’t like to be in a cloud of smoke all of the time. Rooms need to be updated for better sound proofing though as we could hear our neighbors very clearly whenever they would talk or move around in their rooms.
50,We love all of MGM properties whenever we get to go away for a little fun excitement and or relaxation. Service within the Park MGM met or exceeded all our expectations. Food shows location ease of access to everything was great.
50,Had a great time while attending the Jason Aldean concert. Room were clean staff for friendly and too many food choices. I think this use to be Monte Carlo back in he day to give you an idea of where this is.
50,Checkin was smooth every staff member we encountered were so courteous friendly acted like they loved their job. So nice to be in a non-smoking atmosphere. Location was perfect for the hockey game and the rodeo we attended.
50,Calm bright lobby without chaos of large casino hotel. Easy online check-in and electronic key system. Nice size comfortable room. Friendly helpful staff. Easy to get in and out of easy Uber/Lyft access.
30,Nice casino area friendly staff. Floor 28 was filthy. Looked like a road side motel as soon as you got off elevator. Hugh dirty spots on carpet. Our room was ok bathroom was gross hair everywhere dont think sink was even cleaned. Good thing i had my own lysol wipes.
50,This was a very affordable hotel casino that is SMOKE FREE! The rooms are very nice and large. The bathrooms are shower only no tub which I prefer. The tables were affordable and the location is central to many things!
40,I really enjoyed my trip to Vegas and my stay at Park MGM. The room was clean and comfortable. I wished I had more days at the hotel. I just wished that the rooms was equipped with a microwave oven and a little mini refrigerator inside of the rooms.
50,We LOVED our four night stay at a very fresh clean Park MGM. Our room was beautiful staff was friendly and the entire resort smelled so nice. We are never going back to a casino that allows smoking. What a joy not to smell like an ashtray at the end of the night. The resort has a ton of great places to eat. We had brunch several times at Primrose and ate almost every night at Eataly. Our room was cleaned to perfection every day and the short walk to t-mobile arena was super convenient for a Golden Knights game and George Strait concert. There was also a big variety of slots. We plan on making this our go-to resort whenever we visit Las Vegas.
10,This casino is hurting so much they’re extremely understaffed and it shows. Their security guards have nothing better to do but harass you throwing masks at you. They’re obviously losing customers so why chase away what you have? Also they ask for donations when you cash out your vouchers cuz they’re so broke. Bad business model. Also their employees are overworked and underpaid. I’ll be taking my money elsewhere next time. I don’t support this.
50,Had a awesome trip drank good went to the game Redskins even though I’m a Dallas fan had an awesome time. The next time I come to Vegas the park will be The place I will stay because it was awesome for vacation spot
30,Good location smoke free resort makes a difference. Resort fee is insanely high for what you get couldn’t make internet connect. Walls and doors were thin and could hear everything around you down to the window shades being rolled up and down.
50,I give this place a 11 out of 10 possible. From mobile check-in keyless entry accessible ride pick up great rooms friendly staff and just the whole transformation from the Monte Carlo into the Park MGM has been beautifully done. Everything from restaurants gaming shows have been planned out for a great experience!!
30,just ok....much better stays on the strip....need to update rooms and beds.....hallways are dark and beds are old and rooms are outdated. location was ok for a nearby wedding is all....mgm can do better than this.
20,Rooms facing T Mobile Arena can expect loud noise. Knights pavilion plays loud bass music 24 hours a day. Ask for rooms away from that area. Non Smoking casino is a plus. No refrigerator in room. Furniture is worn.
10,Checked into a room that smelled like smoke had stained carpet stained couch dirty and stained linens and pubic hairs in the bathroom floor. We complained and were allowed to move rooms. Second room was like the first but didn’t wreak if cigarette smoke.
50,I Bring my family every year for the National Finals Rodeo (NFR) It's magical time in Vegas when this occurs!!! Raiders home game also is a plus. We stayed at the Park MGM and had a wonderful time!! Eataly is just an AWESOME Place to have some cool coffee and cool deserts!!! Room was nice with a view of T-Mobile arena where the Knights were playing a game!! Those a good times!!! The Park MGM has everything for your family to enjoy!!!
50,Professional courteous knowledgeable cleanliness was great!! The list goes on and on. We appreciate all that you do! Stay the course…..tough world right now and Park is definitely doing their part to make folks forget about it all and make memories
50,This is a great place to stay. Clean non-smoking and great restaurant options. Great location if attending any events at T-Mobile arena. Simple check in by phone was quick and easy. Lots of slot machine choices and fun atmosphere
40,Great on non smoking. Restaurants and room service an issue — not much available weeknights. Contact info wrong online ordering didn’t work right. Charged but order didn’t go through had to pay again and get refund big hassle.
10,Booked package rate with $50 food and beverage credit. Charged less than $50 one night and their system charged me $0.51 overage. Went to front desk to resolve but they didn't understand that $49.18 is less than $50. Night shift Front Desk agent Sydney spent 15 minutes arguing with me that everything was correct but refused to simply add up my charges that night to see if was under $50. Staff is unprofessional and incompetent.    Room could be cleaner as some areas of the carpet were filled with layers of dust.    Bathroom shower drain was clogged and required a service call to fix.    Will not be returning and will warn others not to stay at Park MGM.
50,Park MGM's smoke-free environment is a noticeable improvement over most hotels/casinos on the strip. Also appreciate & recommend the excellent restaurants and bars - Bavette's Best Friend and Primrose - plus the added fun of Eataly. Very enjoyable visit!
40,Food & beverage options were great! The Eataly marketplace was phenomenal & such a lovely variety of choices. Best Friend was also a cool vibe & the food was fantastic. The non-smoking casino was a welcome change!
50,What a pleasant experience in a property that is completely nonsmoking. The NoMad bar served great cocktails with friendly bartenders and the Bevetz steakhouse had wonderful food and top quality service (we enjoyed it so much we dined there two nights in a row). We will definitely return.
40,We were hesitant to try this newly renovated hotel since I thought the price for rooms was a little elevated. But it exceeded every expectation. Friendly staff great amenities felt luxurious at the price we paid. We booked two rooms for two nights and the mobile check in was a bit confusing (I wanted to make sure both rooms were checked in). But we got to Vegas earlier than I though before check in was ready and decided to check with the front desk. Not only was the staff member great she made sure our rooms were adjoining… and she had the rooms set up as soon as we were done! Check in was scheduled at 3pm but she was able to get us in the rooms by 11am! I was truly appreciative. The rooms were great. Loved the sophisticated vibe without the negatives of it feeling stuck up. The restroom was spacious enough (although I wish we’d have a tub). The best we’re comfy! Could get a little warm but the pillows and overall comfort was great. We went Thanksgiving holiday so it was a bit chilly. Being in the room made me feel at home :) lots of outlets both regular and USB.  The lobby- beautiful.  The access to the strip and the casino- easy.  I didn’t check out the pool or the tram way (to Bellagio) on this trip but I know they’re there and available.  Overall great stay. I wish it wasn’t so pricey but I think we got a great deal.  Definitely top contender for a stay on returning trip!  Thanks Park MGM!
50,Our go to place is Park MGM. We love the location and the eateries and the hotel never disappoints. The room are comfortable and the eateries are great. There is no other place we would rather rest our head. Will be back in the new year.
50,Rooms and hotel was very clean. Quick and easy check in. The hotel was in a prime location. I would highly recommend the Park MGM to anyone looking for a great place to sleep well spending time in Las Vegas.
50,Park MGM covers most needs for any stay in Vegas: It's within walking distance of just about any destination on The Strip (and beyond; I walked to Allegiant Stadium in less than 30 minutes) the rooms are affordable without sacrificing quality and the upgrades made over the last years have made Park MGM on par with some of the higher-end hotels on The Strip.
30,I stayed at the Park MGM for a work trip. The conference had a discounted rate so that this was the cheapest option. Park MGM is near a lot of things but the property itself could use some work. My room was dated and the shower didn't drain properly.
50,my wife and I stay at MGM or Caesars Properties we left the Caesars Palace Suite to check out Park MGM I was worried but when we checked in they gave us a nice size suite and the location was fantastic. Had fun in the casino did a casino crawl (didn't know you could walk from Park MGM all the way down to the Mandalay Bay with a brief outside walk) as well as all the way to Bellagio (just a short tram ride from Aria.
50,Dude there is so much to do surrounding park MGM. It’s in such a great location right across T-Mobile arena you can catch a game and get food and shop in such a short distance. I would recommend staying here to anyone.
20,I know this is a hard time for the hospitality industry but I was shocked and now unable to sleep because of a cruel housekeeper.    I am mid-stay. I left my room about 10am. Returned around 4 pm and the room was not made up. I called and made a simple request for the room to be made up and I would be heading out at 4:45. I came back and the room was slightly attended to (some towels 3 hair conditioners for some reason but bo shampoo). My real issue is the housekeeper took it upon themselves to turn the temperature down to 60 degrees (it’s 50 degrees outside). I’m now waiting for the room to warm up to be able to sleep. Why would someone be so cruel?
50,Super nice accommodations and excellent staff. The location was great for getting to the arena to take in the games. The non smoking casino was.a added bonus. The restaurant selection was very good and offered something for everyone!
50,Loved the fact the facility is completely non-smoking! Going back next weekend to see Bruno Mars & jazzed he's playing at the Dolby Theatre which is on property! Should be a great concert!! Nice that I spent long weekend with buddy's & will be able to go back to same facility with my wife hope the keep the hot tub open!!
30,Room was very small. Only a few drawers in closet no dresser. Beds very low to floor. Few food options but connected to Aria so we mostly ate and played there. Staff was nice but would be unlikely to stay again.
50,Loved the stay even though was a short trip the accommodations are fantastic. I've read the other reviews and understand what they say. I feel for the wife and I the stay was above expectations. Am I coming back? YES. Loved the location and smoke free!!!!!
50,The staff was amazing all the way from parking to checking in/out and room service. Amazing. Location was amazing for me still on the strip but also not too close to the craziness. Very nice lobby. The room was clean nothing fancy but it was perfect for is. Also The food at Eataly was delicious
50,Always wanted to check this place out since they first started to build/remodel this place and the surrounding area…it was great (and too short since my wife and I were on a honeymoon road trip and we were just passing through)…nonetheless we liked it and look forward to our next stay soon in the near future.
50,We were very impressed with the cleanliness of the hotel and we were very excited that it was a non-smoking facility!! All of the staff were very friendly and very helpful there were plenty of agents towards the front of the hotel to help everybody check in!!
50,Really enjoyed visiting Las Vegas with family . Loved the fact that it was a non smoking hotel and casino. We had small kids with us so it worked out well to stay on the strip. It was a wonderful trip
50,Love Eataly! We ate at the various counters throughout our stay and loved it! We’d certainly recommend Eataly and Park MGM to anyone staying on the strip. It’s also a nice walk to Allegiant Stadium if attending any events there. We also like the property is smoke-free! Will be back again and again…
50,It was a last minute booking but I could not have been more pleased. I was on the 28th floor it was a beautiful view the room was immaculate and very comfortable. I can’t wait to go back!!!  Plus the price was great!
40,Location was great did not see or talk too much of the staff. We gambled for a couple hours a couple different days could never find anybody to get us a drink. But if you're going to T-Mobile you literally walk across the street you can't beat it and the rooms were clean and comfortable
50,The stay was great. Rooms are spacious and updated. The casino was a blast & the food options were great. The only complaint would be waitress service is not always great when gambling. Probably worse for females?!?
50,It was worth the amount and worth taking the trip. Will most definitely be coming back to Las Vegas. Will be checking out other hotels and their amenities. So excited to be coming back next year hopefully
50,Stayed here for a concert and glad we selected this hotel. Very clean and comfortable. The rooms are quiet and spacious. Love that the casino is smoke free too. The Dolby Theater is a fantastic venue to see a concert as well Foo Fighters sounded amazing! Great place!
10,Carpets look like they haven't been shampooed in years there was hair in my sink and on the counter as well as the floors the water wouldn't drain in the sink or the shower the bath towels were dingy dirty and smelly the bed looks like they just threw the sheets up there didn't even tucke it in no refrigerator no microwave no coffee maker
50,The staff was very friendly and would jump through hoops to make sure you are taken care of. There is no smoking in the casino which is a plus! Other casinos allow smoking in them and it is hard to breathe!
50,I would suggest not to pay for late check out it was such a waste. I was woken hours before time. I could've just checked out regular time. Other than that over all service was great. I feel like the front desk should give house keeping a list of doors not to knock on because of late check out.
30,This was our first stay at Park MGM. The location was extremely handy since the shows were in the fabulous Dolby Theatre. Outstanding sound at the show perhaps the best I've heard. The casino is on the smaller side but it has all you need; a big plus is the none smoking inside the casino. The room while refurbed did presented a number of obstacles which knocked the score to a three. For one the safe would not lock upon arrival. We need to wait around in the room for 45 minutes so that engineering could remediate this issue. Considering the room is on the new side very surprised by the leaky shower; water pouring all over the floor due to poor seal. The biggest surprise the forced lock out on the departure day. Thankfully we had plenty of time until flight departure or we may have been in a major panic. The door would not open; despite three trips to get new keys a visit by front desk staff and security. No luck. Engineering couldn't even open the door and had to resort to some enterprising gadget to open the door....almost 1:20 to get in. Frustrating to say the least.
40,Bed was comfortable but room was sparse. Only two little bars of soap no shampoo in bathroom. Room was clean and housekeeping service was very good. No real complaints just thought more could be included like a coffee maker.
50,I can't say enough about this hotel and the people they have working for them. Everyone at this hotel made my Birthday amazing! Being apart of MLife has changed the way we travel to Vegas..Derrick in the bar at Eataly was absolutely wonderful. Mario at Juniper made some of the BEST dirty martini's I have ever had and Hank from security was one of the nicest people we have ever met and so helpful. We will always stay at the Park going forward. THANK YOU!!!    Jennifer Stiles
50,This was a great place to stay great location friendly staff clean rooms and the whole place is non Smoking which was awesome! Everything was easy to get to from here. I Would recommend this property
50,Our stay was great at Park MGM. We had a nice room and it was clean. The Casino and the restrooms were very clean. The restaurants in the casino are very nice. We loved the Primrose even though it was a bit of a splurge for breakfast. I do wish the beds had box springs. The mattresses give more support with them. Still slept well and it was quiet and a good room.
40,Rooms haven’t aged well and it appears maintenance Cant keep up with repairs. I switched rooms due to constant flushing toilet noise which I recorded only to get one that was much worse. Another person we were meeting had to switch rooms 4 times in their first 24 hours between maintenance and pot smoking guests. Toni the mgr on duty the first 2 mornings would not come out to speak to guests on both days citing I Toni the mgr on duty the first 2 mornings would not come out to speak to guests on both days citing I’m busy in a meeting and she never returned calls as well as the General mgr Scot ’m busy in a meeting and she never returned calls as well as the General mgr Scott I left numerous msgs for him which he never returned. I’m guessing he’s in the same meeting as Toni
40,The front desk staff was super helpful every server we encountered for dining and drinking was exceptional. The rooms are spacious and the beds are comfortable. The only downside is the darkness of the hallways. I prefer to have a well lit hallway and these are very dim and dark.
50,From the first moments we stepped into Park MGM we could tell we were going to have a great stay. Well maintained building extremely helpful staff with every aspect comfortable bed with enough pillows and a great view of the T-Mobile Arena
50,This was our first time to stay here and it was extremely enjoyable. Parking was easy to get to the hotel property and going up to our room was a breeze. Hotel room was clean and everything worked. The bed was so comfortable that we got a good nights rest. Definitely will stay here again.
40,Hotel location is great the layout of restaurants at either end of casino is ideal and hotel floor is not so large that you get lost. Very clean and smart renderings. Food exceptional in the two restaurants we ate (primrose and best friend)
40,This was a very nice hotel. The rooms were spacious and the bathroom was very nice and clean. The staff was very accommodating and nice. Upon arrival our room was not cooling off and staff came up and changed the filter and gave us a food voucher for the inconvenience. The only thing about the rooms were that they did not have dresser big enough for our clothes and they only had 4 hangers in the closet. The hotel is located in a great spot. it was easy to get to anything on the strip.
40,Location location location!  Pricey for quality of rooms I'd give this a 3.5 star hotel rating.  Need coffee machine in room!  Thin walls could hear people beside above talking and opening blinds all day.
50,An awesome PLACE. Try it out for yourself. The food is great. Club “ On The Record “  Was great fir my daughter Birthday. The casinos was not friendly but we had fun. Now I do think that the Hotel needs to shampoo there carpets going to your room. The looked very nasty.
20,Stop booking the hotel close to capacity when you don’t have the staff to match it. 50 minutes to wait for a drink that is $ 22.00 is insanity. The parking garage key on the phone did not always work well.
40,Great hotel. Great location. Good food options. I enjoyed my stay here. Too easy to get to events from the hotel with its access to the Deuce RRTC and taxis and ride share. There were other reviews that indicated being able to hear noise from other rooms. I didn’t find that to be case. I stayed in a room far away from the elevator. Most of the noise I heard came from outside and I’m the halls. I was able to relax in the room during the day even sleep when I didn’t want to run the streets. Lol. Also quiet and peaceful at night at all hours. I’ve seen comments about how small the rooms are and lack of storage. It can be a challenge if you’re in a room with more than one person. I travelled solo and didn’t find it to be a problem. While you can’t get a microwave you can get a fridge for $35 a day. A savings that can allow you to keep cold drinks in your room and save trips to the ice machine. Vending machine drinks aren’t priced too bad but in room dining drinks are expensive. Thank God for DoorDash and Instacart. That can help too. The vending machine choices and in room dining drinks aren’t the same. Instacart and DoorDash will meet you in the lobby with orders. I’d also recommend checking out what events are happening in the area during your stay. It can be tricky getting around. The cabbies and rideshare know all the secrets for getting around traffic. It’s very easy to get to everything from this hotel. And who knows you might change your plans and go to a show you hadn’t thought of. Give it a go. You won’t be sorry.
20,Had to call three times to get my room cleaned. 11:00 am I called housekeeping and told them I was leaving room 3;30 pm I spoke directly to staff working on my floor and told them it had not been done and 6:00 pm came back and still NOT DONE. Called again and waited 20 minutes. That is BS!
50,The staff was friendly and the rooms and bathroom were very clean. All of the equipment in the room (television safe etc.) felt new and worked well. The MGM app enabled me to check in online skipping any lines and enabled the use of my phone as a digital key (for elevators and the room). All-in-all a very good experience.
40,My recent stay at the Park MGM was pleasurable. While I was in Vegas for a conference the Park MGM was quite enjoyable. I especially enjoyed that this casino is smokeless and for that reason I will stay again one day.
40,Pros: Location was great staff friendly comfortable bed good size room lots of lighting  Cons: Amenities were limited: no coffee maker no refrigerator no microwave no robes very limited toiletries (no gel body wash just bar soap and small shampoo/conditioner) no cups
40,Check in was a bit problematic and the beds weren’t very comfortable but the overall experience was good. The location is excellent right next to T Mobile arena so concerts are just a short walk away. I also appreciated that there is no smoking in the casino and hotel.
10,Wouldn’t stay here again! It was our hotel of choice when it was The Monte Carlo. This hotel is hardly downtown quality surrounded by beautiful hotels. It’s only attraction is the TMobile Arena. Aside from its quality the first room was horrible and had to switch the App keys didn’t work in the elevator (all weekend) so we saw way to many floors. The TV continually lost signal and I was told I had to turn the TV off and on which got old. Being charged $14 for a bottle of water I did not buy or consume. $1000 for a two night stay and they want to “accidentally” squeeze 14 more dollars out of me. And one and only one security guard walking around with a mask under his chin harassing guests wearing their masks under their noses. I was at the hotel with a wedding party but because of my experiences I gambled at neighboring hotel/casinos.
30,Rooms noisy marijuana smell pilfered throughout the room next door was a turn off and very noisy overall. Early closing of some of the sports bars was kind of sad on a Friday night but Im sure it’s because of staffing shortages.
50,Really clean rooms and friendly staff very convenient to the strip lots of great food options and good tasting vine venue downstairs slots and games galore and like the lady Gaga store of her featured outfits to award shows and events
10,Rooms are small for Vegas standards dark dirty and desperately need refurbish Casino is third rate Overall the worst Vegas hotel I have stayed at and water overpriced for what you get Location is ok but not enough staff
50,I've been a MLife member for quite some time and enjoy the MGM resorts. I've stayed at the PARK MGM before but this trip was truly exceptional. The crew was fantastic and the service was spot on. Our suite was clean and spacious. We all have a wonderful time. We'll be back soon in 2022.
30,I liked this property because the location and convenience. Unfortunately I got bed bug bites at this time. I have notified it to the front desk staff when I checked it out.  I hope I will be resolved it. I like this property. Thank you
50,Everything was great from the employees to the clean rooms and easy access to everything . I will definitely recommend as well as stay at Park MGM every time I go to Vegas as my first hotel pick.. so many things to do and I love how you Dan digitally unlock room from phone and make your own keys.
40,The room was very nice looking it was clean and we had a great view of park area between Park MGM and NYNY. The only issue was there was no fridge in the room. I would definitely stay here again anytime.
30,The room was good adequate. Love all the plugs available. Air conditioner could be much stronger. Blaring music on the strip all night long kept me from ever getting a good night's sleep. Dolby Live was awesome. Need more food services open late.
50,It’s nice to finally find a non-smoking hotel on the strip. Extremely well kept and very fresh everywhere. Even the casino is perfectly setup for those who do not want to be around damn cigarette smoke. We will be back!!
40,The staff and location of the Park MGM enhance the experience. I wasn't a fan of the Eaterly but other options were available. Bathrooms ALWAYS clean helpful staff and great location - on the strip but back away from the main strip. My room was just ok - mattress too lumpy and the windows were dirty that overlooked the strip. Rooms could use to be refreshed.
30,"Went to a concert at Dolby Live Theater so stayed here for convenience. Hotel casino restaurants etc. were all pretty standard for a strip hotel. Room was just a standard room overlooking ""the strip"" which means a birds-eye view of the casino roof. The Waldorf next door blocks any decent view of the strip. Rooms are nice and clean but no effort on anything special. No coffee maker or fridge weight sensitive honor bar which I guess is probably pretty typical for Vegas. It wouldn't be Vegas if you didn't have to pay extra for even the most basic conveniences. Bottomline nothing special about the place but a pretty basic hotel for the money."
50,I went to Las Vegas for a college basketball game. The Park is located conveniently next to T-Mobile Arena. I would recommend staying there to anyone going to a game or hockey. My room was very clean. I didnt see anything that was out of place. Not sterile but clean. I was on the 16th floor with a pool view. It was nice at night. The entire staff I interacted with treated me well and not in a kiss ass way. They treated me as if they were interested and I believe they were. I would stay there again.  Casino bathrooms were mostly clean. Food and casino staff were helpful and nice.. If I need to stay on the strip I think this is a good choice.
30,This hotel is not designed for a vacation. It's location next to the arena and makes it ideal to crash in before or after attending an event. The rooms lack furniture. It's obvious the last reno was done on the cheap. No dresser so don't plan to unpack. The bed was beyond worn out and the sheets and towels were either beyond there good days or just poor quality. However all the staff were friendly and helpful. This hotel has it place but don't plan a vacation stay here.
10,Park MGM was in excellent location on the strip and made walking a breeze to multiple top locations. However we were charged for a bottle of water for $8 from the minibar which we did not touch. When I attempted to dispute the staff was really rude and implied that I did take the water. They made me fill out a paper form to dispute and never followed up with a resolution.    Be ready to pay extra for things that you didn’t take. Made me wish I actually took a bottle of water so at least I got something for $8.    Also housekeeping starts knocking on your door every morning at 8am and would keep knocking for 20 minutes until you answer which is extremely misaligned to the Vegas nightlife that most people enjoy here.
50,We read about Eataly in the Dec issue of AMA travel magazine and thought we would give it a try. The food was fresh quick and did not come with the typical Vegas price tag. As we were leaving Hank the security guard asked us if we had tried the wine shop. Wine shop? No. Well this is a must hit if you are a wine fan. So many options and you can even purchase a bottle without breaking the bank! There is an adults only dining area so you grab your fare from Eataly and dine away from the cafeteria style tables. The staff was attentive but not in your face and very knowledgeable about Italian wines. Hank was great to chat with and we are grateful to have found this little spot on the strip but without the chaos.
40,I wasn’t sure if I wanted to stay at Park MGM due to other reviews but I’m glad we did the tram was convenient and a non smoking hotel…Eately the Italian eatery in Park was pretty good We had pizza and sandwiches but where’s good a bit pricy but this is Vegas.  This hotel is located near NYNY and The  T mobile Arena is right outside the door.  This hotel is a bit smaller than most right there on the strip.  Was nice to go back to a quieter place to relax. You don’t get to good if a strip view due to the taller buildings surrounding.  I would stay here again in the future.
10,Sad to say that this was the worst hotel experience of my life. Rooms and service are to be desired.    Would be a disservice to friends and family to recommend a stay at the Park MGM.    Dining at Best Friend seemed to be the only positive experience we had in this hotel.
40,Best aspect of this hotel is the entirely smoke free environment ! A welcome change from most Las Vegas hotels. Great value. An added bonus is having Eataly at the hotel. An Italian food lovers paradise. Centrally located easy to get to Aria and Bellagio.
50,Excellent experience. I enjoyed my 3 nights stay. Will be staying here again in the future. I locked myself out twice and the stuff was so helpful. Coconut water in the store is too expensive though $12.
50,We came to town for a concert and choose park MGM because of location but I was very pleased with the Quality of service. The valet attendant Derek was very friendly and extremely helpful with where to find different things.
50,We liked Party Mgm because it’s nonsmoking reasonably priced and very quaint. It’s also a great location and we are easily able to access the other hotels and shops in the area. The tram is great. Great staff. Restaurants are great.
10,A Complete waste of $$  Our room is covered in hair that doesn’t belong to us.  Drinks at the Nomad bar downstairs took 50 minutes for 1st round. The server only had 2 tables.  Followed by being served Absolute when I asked for Tito’s at the craps table I have a gluten allergy I wasn’t told I couldn’t have Tito’s until the 2nd drink. Too little to late it made me sick and it’s day two and I’m taking medicine to offset my stomach. (Thanks)  I can think of many ways to blow $350 a night on a room over $1400 in gambling on 1st night and $100.00 on two drinks and a chicken sandwich and French fries.
50,For us getting many rooms for family it was perfect. We booked early with Covid still around and got some extremely low cost. Location was phenomenal for what we wanted. Place was very clean and safe. Will definitely be back
50,We Enjoyed our stay at the Park MGM. The fact that it is a Smoke Free Hotel was a big plus for us. Our room was very nice and comfy. Plenty of room for all our belongings. Loved the large shower. Would stay here again.
30,We stayed for Thanksgiving weekend and booked the Stay Well Suites. Price was affordable considering a holiday.  Check-in in person and there was a long line. And front desk gave us the wrong room. We got a standard double queen instead of the stay well suites. It was quite an inconvenience.
50,I love the fact that it’s smoke free zone! Most especially if you have kids and you don’t smoke yourself this is the place to be! Right next to CVS and a lot of other shops! Will surely stay there again next time.
50,My first time staying at this hotel and I will definitely be back. Check in was easy and fast rooms were clean and modern staff was friendly and the location is great. Great restaurants! Also loved that the hotel and casino were non smoking.
50,Sisters trip to see Duke play Gonzaga. Everything went perfectly. No delays errors or mishaps! Thank you for making this go so well. Location was so convenient and we felt safe and secure the entire time. And Duke won!
30,Ok room with furnishings that seemed acquired in a hotel-going-out-of-business sale but the room was clean. There is no coffeemaker and it is a long long long walk to get a cup. Allow a half hour between the walk and the wait at the Starbucks near the lobby. Staff was great. Eataly is a nice addition. Many of the bars and restaurants were closed when we visited the week after Thanksgiving.
50,Super easy check in clean rooms and non smoking casino equals one of my favorite places to stay on the strip. Additionally the parking is convenient and the staff is friendly. I would recommend the Park MGM LV.
40,We had a great time at Park MGM room was clean building was quiet love that it’s all smoke free! It was not in the action packed part of the strip which sometimes felt like you were missing out. Great stay! We will be back!
40,Very enjoyable trip and stay at Park MGM. The location is very convenience to everything. The Asian staff who help me to do the remote check-in provide exceptional service. It was quick and easy. He even recommend some nice Korean BBQ restaurant nearby to me. Very nice person.
40,I will come again great area  excellent staff food great lost at the casino but I was ever happy with my stay . I will make sure I tell others about this hotel. Ever clean. Everything close so early for food
50,Wife and I were nearby the Eataly inside Park MGM yesterday and decided to do a quick shopping in there. We wondered into wine section. A very nice security officer Mr. Hank Graae greeted us. Hank was very friendly and very knowledgeable about Italian wine northern region in particular. Not only he got wine bottles to the cashier for us he sensed that we live local and told us the 10% discount we could get for the wine the super good price wine tasking for early bird hours and different restaurants inside Park MGM in great detail. Thank you Hank for the great experience we had and hoping to see you again next time we are there.
30,Small room no place to put clothes and everything is over priced. It was so much nicer when it was the Monte Carlo. Mgm has ruined the unique character of the hotel. We will stay at a hotel not owned by mgm in the future
40,First time been here at Park MGM. Rooms were a bit small. Most of the staff was great. Cleanness of the room and hotel was good. Bit more variety of food could have helped the hotel. The bartenders were a bit rude and would help you till you had to yell to come to you. Overall was good place for first time or to try out.
40,I thought the hotel was nice and the staff was very friendly. We went to the Duke so the proximity to the TMobile Arena was awesome. Table games also seemed pretty generous. Was a little disappointed that there seemed to be a lot fewer video poker machines from the last time we were here.
50,We came to LasVegas for Thanksgiving and were very pleased with our entire stay. Highly recommend it for anyone wanting to stay in a prime location on the strip; You can easily walk to all the other resorts and hotels.
10,Given low floor overlooking back lot  Noise from Night club underneath the room  Loud noise coming from the hall way outside the door no insulation  Very hot room no sleep and noise from night club  Parking lot outside  No smoking  Tiny room no ambiance  Terrible dark decorated hotel room hallway
30,Valuable nice staff room is not clean bed is old not sleep well.Nice staff when I check in play $40 for early check in.Parking $15/time so expensive. Casino is good you can free drink with tip only. Starbucks inside hotel is too busy you must be wake up early to buy but comfortable to drink coffee in the morning.
50,We had the best trip ever from checking in to checking out.  Our room was upgraded when they found out it was my birthday. The best was extremely comfortable and the hallway was quiet. I had the best sleep ever.  Our meals were excellent and we found the employees throughout the casino hotel and valet to be extremely helpful and friendly.
50,We stayed at Park MGM over the Thanksgiving holiday weekend and absolutely loved it. It's so nice to be able to enjoy the hotel facilities and casino without smelling like cigarette smoke at the end of the day and that alone gives Park MGM a lead over the over hotels on the strip.  We stayed in a room with a view of the strip (which is slightly more expensive) but worth it! Housekeeping is so prompt and quick as well - the room was always in beautiful shape after returning for the day. We ordered room service for breakfast one day and were shocked when the food arrived a mere ten minutes after our call! It wasn't fancy (but it is expensive).  I used both the salon and spa which were incredible. I pre-booked a hair appointment and while at the salon I mentioned to my stylist that I was looking for a place to get my makeup done. Then and there they were able to book me a makeup appointment just after my hair was done! At the spa I got a facial and made sure to stick around afterwards to use the facilities like the sauna and whirlpool. Everyone at both the salon and spa were so friendly and accommodating.  And then the food! It's so fun to wander around Eataly and order cocktails and a variety of Italian food. And right around the corner is Best Friend a restaurant that we ended up visiting 3 times because it was so delicious and the atmosphere was amazing.  The hotel is a little farther down the strip than we anticipated so it can be quite a long walk to other locations but there's a very convenient tram system that will take you next door to Aria and the Bellagio (and that can really cut down on the walking time!)
20,We stayed here for 2 nights. Room was basic casino was sub-par. Only good thing is that it is non-smoking and security. Would have paid half the price and stayed in a better casino hotel. Will not recommend for people who want to have fun in casino
50,Everything was good servicesvaletregistration people on floor Everything was clean 👌 🙌 I hope next time I'm be there 🙏 good valuegoo location sleeping quality good for all my family 👪 and friends
50,If you have kids and have plans to watch a hockey game this is the perfect location for your stay. Love that this hotel is smoke-free and close to great restaurants kids would love at a reasonable price.
50,From the minute we drove up to the Park MGM we were greeted by a friendly valet and from then on every staff member was so kind helpful and efficient. The rooms were clean spacious and comfortable. We LOVED our stay!
50,The poker tournament at mgm grand is the best daily poker tournament in all of Las Vegas and even Los Angeles the 100k chop addon is what makes it unique. The $5000 gtd gets smashed even tome to $11000 to $15000
40,Beautiful hotel. Staff is very friendly and kind. Loved being able to walk across the street to New York New York. The room could have been a little cleaner but all in all is was a great hotel for our stay.
10,We received a noise complaint and head of security came to our door with 5+ security personnel. They asked us to turn down the music which we turned off. 2 minutes later we opened our front door finding the 5+ security listening to what we were doing. The head of security Beatriz told us to pack our bags and leave the room and threatened to press charges after we were recording for our own safety. The hotel manager ended up coming up and saw there was nothing going on and had security leave as we felt incredibly uncomfortable and threatened. I don’t recommend coming to this hotel. Housekeeping came in when we weren’t in the room after opting out of the service. The towels and bedding were stained.
20,Was in town to see a basketball game over the Thanksgiving week. Throughout the week there was an overwhelming scent of sewage in the lobby by the elevators. While this was limited it was reeeeaaaaaally off-putting. Additionally the beds were a weird combination of being too firm and too soft at the same time - it seems like they started out as firm and over the course of time they became soft in all the wrong areas. Also - they're tall enough for a toddler but for a full-grown adult they're waaaaaayyyyy too short.    Otherwise the staff were fine the checkin process was great etc. but this all culminated into a rough experience that was just below average.
50,Always a pleasure to stay at the centralized location non-smoking facility and very accomodating and professional staff. The easy access to the parking and don't have to worry about traffic and waiting to enter the park MGM property is a plus.
50,I love MGM properties - From the time you arrive to leave is easy and comfortable . Super nice people working there . I was to Park MGM and everything was same as i expected . Clean room  Shower and the desk - Only was little problems with manual lights and outside view . MGM also gifted me $200 free replay and $200 resort credit . I really appreciated them . I hope MGM Will stay there forever . Again  Love MGM
20,There were very few table games open sports bar in “Sportsbook” was closed at 2 pm when there were a ton of college basketball games going on especially when Vegas was hosting a number of college basketball teams. I thought this was very DUMB and not self aware. Rooms have chains holding lights from the ceiling like the 70’s or 80’s after the big rebrand to MGM this was a big disappointment also no hotel in Vegas should have a “13” floor. No refrigerator in room was also a strange thing these days. Again the big rebrand MGM was not that long ago and I was very disappointed with my stay.
50,I arrived in Park MGM around 4pm  on Tuesday November22. Google maps took me to the wrong parking garage but the staff are very friendly. They told me where to go just a few minutes from where I am. I check in so easy when walk in side the hotel. A lot of stuff stand by to help you. Maybe just 3 minutes. That's all you want.
50,I live that the resort was smoke free. As my fiancé and myself have allergies this was so awesome and great for us. Plus the atmosphere was great and rooms clean and spacious. I will be staying here once again in the very near future.
40,I really like this hotel. Location is great and you can take the tram to the Bellagio. The dealers at the craps tables were very friendly and made it fun. The pasta at Eataly was dry and the staff was unapologetic and unhelpful about it. I would stay in the hotel again but I would never order pasta there. The couple next to us had a problem with their food as well.
20,Great location and excellent cleanliness - especially with the smoke free atmosphere.    Rooms are not good. They're small and there is virtually no storage (aside from a few tiny drawers in the closet). There is no desk work station for business travellers. Also had maintenance issues with a broken safe and a nonfunctional HVAC that woudlnt budge off of 65F.
10,Service and staff were horrible. I got 2 rooms and both were not clean. 1 smelled like pot. Food was almost unedable. Check in staff was rude. We had someone handicap with us and they were not accommodating to that. Floor in 1 room was sticky in areas.
40,Room was decent only issue was water pressure and there was a chip on the tub that looked like it was being Un noticed hotel bed was amazing great sleep just need more sound buffer between rooms hear all the conversations from next door
20,Tiny room. Noisy. Ridiculous resort and parking fees. Guest should be free for parking. Rooms were not sound proof. You can hear next door loud and clear. Doors were loud and banging when closing. Sucks!!!
30,Not all dogs are registered with hotel. But overall the hotel is ok. Reasonable for a mid strip hotel. Smoke free casino is a plus. Self parking exit with phone app has issues. Needs to be fixed. Carpets in hallway vertexes near elevators appear to be stained.
10,If you want to stay in a room that’s the size of a box shoe with no storage no mini fridge no closets then this is the place for you. We had an awful experience and are platinum members of MGM. The staff is inadequate. If you are to stay at an MGM property I would recommend Vdara.
30,Ok rooms thin walls and floors. Friendly staff. Non-smoking casino is whatever. Restaurants just ok nothing open late so eat early if you’re hanging there all night. Room service menu is weak not recommended. When you consider the resort fee this hotel is not any kind of stellar experience.
50,We've been visiting Las Vegas regularly for several years and have stayed at several different places. Park MGM is the best we've experienced. Courteous staff nice rooms easy to navigate thru the casino and hotel. We'll definitely stay again. Good value for the money.
40,Nothing spectacular with Park MGM mobile check-in was great location was great simplicity of resort was nice. Good options were ok room service was disappointing leaving all my trash that I bagged up for pickup just left in the middle of my floor. Overall I would stay there again but I would look at other options first.
40,Real nice and clean room. Comfy bed tho it is lower to the ground than I’d like. Decor was not my cup of tea. Didn’t like the walk in shower set up because you have to step in to reach the valve and the cold water hits you before you get out unless you point the head at the wall.
50,Amazing experience at the park MGM. Everything you need is at this casino you don’t need to leave unless you want to go else where. Non smoking casino is the best. Service is great. If you want convenience this is where you want to go!
50,We will be heading back in January after our first visit this past summer. We wete presently surprised with the hotel. We had a chance to eat at Primrose which was priced high for Vegas standard. We had a very good meal and the atmosphere is fresh and lively. They have several great restaurants including best friends and Lala noodle. The pool area is understated but inviting and well laid out. The hotel is non smoking at convenient to the T-Mobile arena. We enjoyed the slightly quieter nature of this end of the strip. A quick tram ride takes you to Bellagio. You are right next-door to New York New York and across the street from MGM Grand . The rooms are basic and lack storage. The bathrooms are well appointed with great showers. For the price this is a go to for us. Beats Bally’s Treasure & Planet.
50,This was the second time I stay at the park and I enjoyed it. I was there for four nights and it did not disappoint. From the room cleanliness to the staff friendliness it was a very enjoyable vacation.
50,Nice to have the Primrose restaurant open again. No coffee makers in the room and Starbucks is crowded in AM. The casino action is limited compared to others but all the dealers are friendly. Cage and rewards staff are awesome.
40,We really liked the room and the staff but it was a nightare to get breakfast lunch or dinners. For starters the room service kitchen hours is limited all restaurants downstairs close at 10 pm and if you want a real breakfast (no starbucks no bagels) you only ave one choice in the premises and it's really crowded. Other than that i loved it
50,Was very pleased with the courteousness and professionalism of everyone at the Park MGM. Check in was smooth. Valet and Bell Desk staff were prompt and very accommodating during my multiple trips to load and unload items at Conference Center. Our UCC guests and dignitaries remarked on a great experience at actual event plus appreciated the convenient access from parking and valet area to the event in Conference Center. Catering and A/V staff were very professional and responsive to requests before and during the event. Helped us produce a high energy great experience for our guests. THANK YOU!
50,If you are search of a smoke-free clean and friendly hotel/casino that is centrally located on the Las Vegas strip Park MGM is the place! The staff were very friendly and helpful. The dining options were delicious and convenient. The best part about the Park MGM is location location location!
40,Pound music on the strip hearing it late at night and I was on the 14th floor plus parking with the Golden Knights playing it was hard to get in the parking lot and park MGM other than that it was OK .
50,Service was great rooms were outstanding. Location of Hotel is very conveniently located.  Definity will stay again. Although tables were a little pricey. Looks like Vegas is forgetting we are recovering slowly out of covid times.
50,This experience was awesome I really can appreciate great customer service everyone I spoke to took there time with me explaining any questions all the people were so nice and friendly and please don’t hesitate to stop by at the steak house there food were delicious there server I had was Carlos he was extremely kind and funny and fun to have around overall this was a 10 star
50,Where in other hotels it’s difficult to contact a Manager at Park MGM the front desk Manager was directly involved.    Exceptional customer service very clean and best stay for your money.    Last minute stay and management went out of their way to accommodate our request.    Love the hotel I didn’t even feel a need to leave the property.
50,Great hotel on the strip. Clean and smoke free. Accessible staff and building. Staff were very friendly and accommodating. Loved that it had access to the MGM Park. Rooms were clean. Loved the variety of restaurants and pleasantly surprised with “EATALY”. Part of the MLife properties. Like MGM Grand but not so huge.
40,Nice hotel in the middle of everything. Food at hotel and downtown Vegas was great. Very convenient place in the middle of the city. Staff was friendly and helpful. We enjoyed our stay. Would recommend it to anyone wanting to go to the area.
50,Beutfil vew nice restaurant cool rooms nice bar's very nice slat good service very nice people working clean rooms Easley to get the bolvared easy to go from one caseno to another very nice sweming pool love going to the train going to aria and marag
40,We will continue to stay at Park MGM as long as it's non-smoking. There are places that are more center strip with nicer rooms but we really like the non-smoking aspect. It's a lively casino with lots of fun machines and the casino personnel are very nice especially the craps crew.    I wish the hotel had a designated floor for dogs. The first room we got was unacceptable because a dog in the adjoining room was yapping constantly. The front desk moved us to another room. I wish it were a hotel that accepted service dogs only. I don't like dogs in a nice hotel. There were lots of dogs in all over Las Vegas this time.    The King Room we had this time was basic. Small closet but it was fine. It was very clean and housekeeping was good. I just called each morning and let them know I wanted the room serviced and they were always there to clean before noon. Nice towels plenty of sundries and lots of good hot water wtih good pressure.    Lots of good restaurants. They could use a plain ole café. Primrose is very nice and a good place for breakfast but a little fancy and expensive for eggs and bacon. There's a Starbucks that stays really busy. The steakhouse Bavette's is very good. It's expensive but all steakhouses are. It has very good service.    Again there are nicer rooms on the strip but these are ok. As long as this hotel is non-smoking I'll stay here. It's so nice!
10,Rooms were dirty no room service shower didn’t work at first safe had to be reseted by security no costumer service at all. Concierge was zero and casino host are never there and don’t know how to do they’re job. Going to Vegas for 10 years and my gambling activity always gave me discount on rooms and at Park MGM they gave me zero.
20,Check in went smoothly but then then a system glitch flagged me as a no show so check out was a nightmare. The room key did not work the self park garage exit correctly. The rooms don't have a coffee maker or fridge. High resort fee for very few amenities and a self park fee add up to almost $60 per day!
50,Good rooms good ubicación good casino excelente service good food nice swimming pool fast checkout new rooms excelente for not smoking good beverages good stores good restaurants cleaning elevators
50,We love that the casino is non-smoking. The really like the decorations and theming. The couch in our King bed room was nice to have. Check-in and check-out is a breeze with the app. Super convenient.
50,Clean and sophisticated. Smart looking and comfortable both for working and kicking it. Right next to the T-Mobile Arena we walked 3 minutes to the venue. All the amenities you could ask for in the lobby. Staff was so friendly and accommodating. I will definitely be back.
50,Perfect location to the stadium. Super easy to use the tram to get to other close destinations. Wish it was warmer and we would have tried out the pool looked really good from our window. Maybe next time. On property restaurants were great.
50,I came to a concert ant MGM and this was the first time staying at Park MGM. It was convenient and close to the concert. The service was all good from the start from parking to desk casino and room service I will defiantly recommended specially if you have kids this Hotel is smoking free and that is a plus for people how don't like been around second hand smoke.
30,Great location cause you can walk directly to Aria without stepping outside. The only negative is that the casino feels old and dated. Could use a refresh with new flooring and brighter lighting in the hallway to the rooms.
40,Located centrally on the Strip. We walked to dinners and concerts at Caesar's Palace and Allegiant Stadium. Especially convenient for events at Dolby Live or T-Mobile Arena. Good food options with Best Friend and Eataly. Nice-sized casino as well.
50,This place was above and beyond what we expected. We look forward to our next trip back we loved that it was very relaxing and fun to be at. We are hoping to enjoy some time by the pool our next trip.
50,I return to Park MGM almost every time I visit Las Vegas. It is superlative in every respect. Their response to issues and adherence to COVID protocols are commendable. My only concern is the long distance from the garage to the room to the strip etc. but that is the norm in LV.
20,Rooms have no fridge our room was dusty stained and dirty. Stained comforter and nasty stained toilet. Luckily I had sanitizing wipes and Lysol spray. Rooms seem a bit small for price value and restaurant choices are not the best. Wish parking was free. Not worth the money and will not be coming back ever
50,First time staying here. Such a cool eclectic artsy hotel in n a great location! We stayed here because we attended a basketball game at T-Mobile arena which is directly across from the hotel. Will definitely be back.
30,Great location on the strip. But room was not as nice as pictured and there were stains on bedding and towel. In room amenities were lacking (no mini fridge). Probably would not return to this property.
40,You should know this is not a Hyatt property so you can not use any benefits like upgrades late check out and required to pay resorts fee. But I was able to use my Hyatt free night. I was disappointed but this was confirmed when I called Hyatt.
50,The Park is in the center of everything I like in Las Vegas. Across the street from the TMobile Arena so entertainment and sports are steps away. Eataly is amazing. I also enjoy the smoke free environment. It is next to the Amazing Aria. The New New York is on the Southside of Park. There is so much to do you will never be bored here.
40,Very Good trip! Helpful staff comfortable accommodations. It would be nice to have a coffee make in the hotel room but other than that no complaints. It was great to have the conference center and great food choices within walking distance inside the hotel.
40,The rooms are great and the bed were very comfortable. Unfortunately we had a room on the 4th floor that faced the T-Mobile arena. The block parties going on throughout the week were so loud you couldn’t hear yourself think. Make taking any mid-day naps impossible. I would recommend to anyone staying to request a room that isn’t facing that area.
50,everything was great and the hotel was in great location to get to other casino. the check i. anf check out where nice and easy to do without hardly waiting for either. it had a great atmosphere thoughtout the hotel.
50,I've stayed at this casino several times beautiful rooms and great staff. On site restaurants are great. Rarely had a reason to leave the property. Beds and pillows were very comfortable. Smoke free facility.
50,I was a long time stayer at NYNY decided to try Park MGM due to it being nonsmoking. I was not at all disappointed! Amazing staff so friendly easy check in and out experience very clean and comfy bed and spacious room.
50,Very easy checkout and in!  Rooms are sized correctly with very comfortable beds.  Could use coffee in the room! Valet parking easy.  Good location easy access to strip and other casinos!  All associates were very helpful and professional!
40,I found that the staff was kind and friendly and easy to deal with. I asked the attendance to service my room on two separate occasions and when I came back from where I was it was not serviced. There was also a broken lamp on the wall when I got there and when I tried to turn it on it just almost fell off the wall completely. It was probably hard to tell that it was broken I just wanted to let you know that. Overall I appreciate this day at park MGM Las Vegas and I would return in the future. Thank you so much I appreciate everything. Thomas James
40,Love that this is a non-smoking property. It made a huge difference in the enjoyment of our stay. The staff is very friendly and accommodating. The room is comfy but do not expect any extras. It’s very bare-boned.
30,Low prices bring loud & young crowds screaming playing music and slamming doors all night. Surprisingly hard to get into a bar to get a drink! Best thing about the hotel is the location - easy to find elsewhere to find tables food and drinks!
30,Room was fine. Check in was not what I expect from a hotel of MGM Park's caliber. Hotel and restaurants were nice. Just did not like the check in process. Next time I will head to the front desk and not use kiosks.
10,I am very dissatisfied with the service I received at Park MGM. They don’t give their customers anything. I still have not received my dine in credit and I stayed there 3 times. I will never stay here again.
50,Stayed here for a guys golf trip. Couldn’t be happier with the whole experience. Highly recommend and will be staying here again. The valet was very helpful we had early morning tee times everyday and they would have or vehicle downstairs and ready to go each morning.
30,After having stayed at the Aria our last five trips we were somewhat disappointed with some services. Asked the conciergeto print out our boarding passes and they said no always got that service at Aria. Restaurants seem to have strange hours like not open in afternoon not good when we arrive nmd day and have trouble getting something to eat bar and lounges not open during afternoon ammeneies not up to par. Ww will not stay here again
50,Very nice hotel. Rooms are clean and well kept. You have to request housekeeping to clean your room. Restaurants are very good but always too crowded. The wait times are very long. Too bad that they don’t offer a better variety of restaurants like at New York New York Hotel.
50,We stayed at this location for a business trip it was nice that the entire hotel and casino were non-smoking. they had a good selection of places to eat as well and it was close to other casino's and eating establishments.
50,I was in Vegas for work and then my family met me there for the weekend. We have a wonderful time at Park MGM. It was a nice hotel/casino and the staff was especially friendly. The security guard Hank (I think last name Grace) in Eataly went out of his way to help me and make my experience there more special. I would definitely recommend it again!
50,Clyde & Scott at Park MGM the west bar . 25 years both both day one employees . Very attentive . And easy to talk with . Even with the bar being busy . They still had the time to chat with me . & talk about their years of experience . Clydes favorite thing about it working at the west bar is meeting people from all over the world. Scott’s favorite thing in the Wes bar is the customers and his coworkers . It’s a fun time and the environment is great . The time goes by fast when your having good company .
50,Everything from the mobile app checking in and out using the digital key and eating at the Eataly dining area Makes the stay at Park MGM a very enjoyable experience. I would recommend to everyone staying here and see for yourself.
40,This was our first visit to Park MGM as we typically stay at other MGM properties. We booked for 3 nights and got a great price that we couldn’t pass up and went into it knowing it probably wouldn’t be perfect or luxury. Spoiler- It was neither but it was still a nice stay. We paid for early check-in and requested a high floor room away from the elevator. We received both and were able to complete the early check-in online without issues. Upon arriving at the room I should have also requested a non- connecting room-I hate them as they can be so loud but thankfully we had quiet neighbors. We didn’t pay for a view but had a respectable view of Aria with beautiful mountains in the background. The room is small but well set up and I appreciated the amount of outlets and USB plugs next to both sides of the bed. We did have issues with the tub drain being very very slow. We also had issues with the room being very hot. Honestly that one issue would be enough to keep us from returning. In November the HVAC could barely keep up. I would never chance staying during warm weather. We didn’t eat in any restaurants. We had one cocktail at the Lobby Bar which was busy with slow service. The Starbucks had typical crazy Starbucks lines. It was very convenient getting around using the tram and the CVS right out in the strip was a great thing to have. All in all a nice stay but you can do much better for just a little more money.
40,Scott at circle bar was excellent. Food at Best Friends restaurant was awesome. I would recommend to family and friends. Happy to see Vegas is coming back. I am looking forward to my next visit. Thank You
50,We will always return to the Park MGM due to location convenience comfortable rooms beds showers quick elevators with secure key codes; wonderful amenities Eataly food court smaller casino which was easier to navigate. Wonderfully polite and knowledgeable staff. Best of all…no spiking anywhere!!!!!
50,Non smoking is great! Very clean casino. The Friday and Saturday morning craps team is the best! So much fun. Thank you Benny Chris Mindy and Sudie! Eataly had many options for a quick meal. Tony at the bar will take great care of you for fine Italian food if you don’t want to commit to a restaurant. The spa is very nice and a quite break from the excitement of the casino. Christina gave me the best massage of my life! I would return just for her. Thank you MGM for making a smoke free casino. Chris.
40,Love the location and food options are great. Prime Rose is great. Next friend is good. Nomad library was delicious. beds are soso rock hard. Would stay again but be prepared not to rest when you go to sleep
50,This is the best property on the strip. Everyone is very helpful and kind. I feel very welcome every time my wife and I go to Vegas. We never stay anywhere else. The steakhouse at MGM was very cool as well.
50,It is a pleasure to find a hotel in Vegas that has excellent facilities on the strip and with great restaurants with No Smoking. We have had a number of trips to the MGM Park. The staff are very friendly and professional.
50,Great staff very clean rooms and the property has excellent restaurant choices to choose from. This was a true 5 star experience!. Park MGM really does hit it out of the Park. I cannot imagine staying anywhere else.
50,It was good. They ran out wash rags so I went to buy my own. But other than that it was good. Oh and the shower drains on the floor be careful. Everything else was ok with the stay there in Vegas!!!!!!
20,The room temperature is was way too hot. That coupled with no fan made for a miserable attempt at sleeping. The hallways were dark and daunting. Not enough staff around to help first timers. Would not recommend for people to enjoy their stay.
50,Had a great stay and a great staff experience. Love waking up and walking right into the middle of the strip to get my day started. And the casino is always up to standards. Cant wait to come back for new year.
50,This hotel casino went completely smoke free!!! It’s a great location easy to get around and the casino has good selection of games and drink service. The rooms are okay nothing to write hone about but the beds are very comfortable!
50,The hotel has a great location parking is close to lobby. Room was really modern and comfy. Bathroom was large great shower. Bed was super comfy. If you get a great rate on the room it's a great stay. Of course Eataly takes the Park over the top. Don't go to Starbucks - go to Eataly for coffee + pastries + fresh squeezed OJ! One thing depending on where your room is ... if there is something outside at the TMobile arena... it can be loud... but only during the evening.
50,Very nice! I would highly recommend the hotel. Excellent location. Clean affordable friendly! The staff was professional. I will definitely return. It’s worth a visit. It was definitely one of my favorite properties on the strip.
50,Cozy comfortable room. Modern decor. Clean bathroom. Shower was the best. Convenient to nightlife. Ample shopping. Atmosphere is rejuvenating. Easily to get around. Plenty of sanitizer stations with masks.
30,Love the location. Italian market that’s attached is pretty cool. Room was dusty and wouldn’t cool down well for me. I would stay again but would rather stay at other hotels that have more to offer. Thanks
50,What a great place for wine food and more. The prime rib panini fab. Hank G security was a knowledgeable guy on wine finds as well.  We will be back to continue to explore more food & wine on our return to Vegas.
30,Stay at link or other newer hotel for better price. Nothing really special. Last month stayed at rio hotel and was the same experience. They are just over price hotel. Corridors are really small food and casino are so expensive.
50,This guy is awesome! We were looking at some wines and he came up to help us out picking one for our dinner! He was beyond helpful and was so nice giving us vouches for dinning at The Park MGM! Very nice man and very helpful! We love Hank with security!
50,I always like to stay here when I’m in Vegas. I love that it’s smoke free pet friendly and I don’t have to walk a mile to get to my room! Staff is always friendly and Best Friend is the best restaurant in Vegas!
10,Dirty sheets and rooms with very poor service. Sheets were absolutely not changed from the prior guests. Took pictures to show front desk and they agreed but hotel was full with no other rooms available. Sink was clogged and would not drain. We were given $200 credit to compensate and then Over charged on our bill by over $300  Make sure to review and check your bill before paying. Poor service over all!!
30,No fridge in the room female hostess at eataly sit down restaurant rude there was no line and hardly anyone in the restaurant looks at us and goes and does something else for a while then ignores one of us and asks table for one when there were two of us standing in front of her expensive to eat and gamble and no piker room
50,I just totally love staying here... No needs to go anywhere else...Everything you need is within your reach..Room services was perfect!.. We were serviced fresh Hot food within minutes of ordering at last minutes ... I love the total convenience...
50,Park MGM was GREAT! Rooms were clean spacious and had a great layout. We went to several bars/ restaurants in the hotel food was amazing and service was excellent. We definitely will stay at Park MGM again next time we go to Vegas. Highly recommend.
50,The rooms may not be quite as nice as surrounding options but the location on site amenities and staff at this hotel are excellent. The casino is very nice and the only smoke free option on the strip. This hotel is also connected to the Aria via indoor walk way and is a 2 minute walk outside from New York New York. I would definitely stay here again.
50,We came to see Evanescence and the Chiefs play…both won!! Park MGM is the best! We love the location! And the rooms are awesome! The couch by the window is where my husband loves to drink his Starbucks coffee while I sleep in🤣
50,Was really fun and pleasant place to be at the MGM park we highly recommend this place  it’s close to all the attraction and to nice hotels like MGM New York and the best thing of all it’s NO Smoking at all
30,The venue across the street is very loud. It's impossible to get any rest in the room. No extra amenities like cotton balls robes or anything like that which is surprising for the price of the rooms.
50,I came here for a conference and I was delighted to be able to spend the whole time in a smoke free environment! The hotel and casino were calm friendly and above all smoke free!!    I loved the vibe of the whole hotel and it's easy accessibility to the strip without feeling like you were in the middle of the strip and could not get away.    The only drawback was there is NO coffee in the rooms and the line for Starbucks each morning was 30 minutes. THAT made life difficult!!! One morning there was a small coffee cart but they only had small coffees.
50,"Was in town for a trade show at the Convention Ctr. About a 10-15 minute Uber ride.  Friendly professional staff. Clean rooms nice restaurants on property. Good value! Liked the upgraded ""clean rooms"". Only a few dollars more and worth the money."
50,The MGM Park is smoke free. If you don't like smoke this is your place! The views are great staff are amazing and friendly! It right across the road from the Grand and New York if you want to wonder out but we enjoyed coming back to this place at the end of the day!
40,I accidentally left some jewelry in my room when checking out and the hotel said they never found it. Which means it was never turned in from the housekeeping person. I’ve left many valuables in other rooms and never had a problem retrieving them.
40,Nice property close to everything clean rooms and nice casino. We paid more for a strip view and ended up with a pool view because we had 4 rooms and wanted them on the same same floor-so don’t bother upgrading your room if you have multiple. We also tried making a group dinner reservation well in advance and never got a response until it was a week before the trip and I finally got someone on the phone-everything was booked by then. Eataly is great but parts were closed which was a bummer-we all wanted gelato and cannolis but they were not open for some reason. Also we got a cabana-heads up the pool is mostly shaded all day-we got stuck at the shaded pool and it was a waste of money in my opinion.
50,Centrally located to other properties for great dining and all the fun games you want to play. Alway make sure you get and use your mlife players card at restaurants bars and stores to earn more point play.
10,The hotel itself is very nice but the hotel rooms are comparable to a clean motel room. Walls are thin no vents in the restrooms and the hallways feel endless. The beds are comfortable but the feel of the room feels very dark because of the red color. I saw a green color in some of the rooms and would much rather have had a room with this color. If you stay at this property request a green colored room closer to the main entrance of elevators.
50,Great room great service Eataly did not disappoint. Walking distance to all the great restaurants and strip sightseeing. We did not get to Bavettes due to no resevations available until after 9:30 pm.
50,4th Annual trip for me to meet High School Friend and others for a fun filled time at the CRAP tables and enjoying all of the Amenities. Bavette's was exceptional as always. Plans for next years stay is already in the works. See you then!
50,Very clean and friendly atmosphere for casino.  The Park MGM has a great variety of gaming table’s slot machines eating choices and is in a convenient location.  The park area between Park MGM and New York New York is fantastic for a spot to sit and relax.  The pool area is also world class.
40,the whole facility just smells better being smoke-free especially in the  casino. very nice food options with Eataly and good wine selection.  all employees very pleasant. location very convenient next to T-Mobile arena. definitely will stay again
50,Had a great time staying at the Park MGM. Easy access to the Aria for our conference great prices and all of the staff were friendly and courteous. Had a little trouble with the mobile check-in (delay in getting my room key) but that was resolved quickly after speaking with the VIP Services desk.
50,A great hotel and casino. The best part about it smoke free!! It also has our favorite steakhouse in Las Vegas Bavettes.  Hotel check in was super easy and the staff was friendly. Room was nice and clean. Could have done better with the soap and shampoo in the shower. Overall great stay and will return.
50,We really enjoyed our stay at ParkMGM. It is in a great location and has tons of things to do in and around the property. The entire property is non smoking so that was a huge plus for us. We will definitely consider staying here again on our next trip to Las Vegas.
50,Great experience. Friendly staff. Nice rooms. Great location on the strip and right across from TMobile Arena. EATLY offers some good Italian cuisine and the Best Friend Cafe is a must! Casino experience was enjoyable as well.
50,First time at ParkMGM. very clean and fresh air due to all non-smoking.  Italian food and drink area was amazing with all the variety. A little spendy but  convenient and delicious. Casino area and bars were very fun and staff was nice  and helpful.
50,Park MGM is our go to home away from home from here on out. Love the location and proximity to so many dining options with NY/NY being next door and an easy team ride to the Bellagio. Nomad up top is amazing also. Pool is easy to get to. Love Park MGM
40,Other than no Fridge or microwave the hotel was beautiful and close to everything. Loved the atmosphere. Would stay again with family not for partying more for older couples and families. Checkout was easy too
50,This is a great hotel. Loved the rooms and it is in a great location. The street outside of the hotel off of the strip is beautiful with a lot of dining and entertainment options. I would definitely stay here again.
50,Excellent time at Park Mgm. Stayed there many times the last few yrs. Enjoy the casino. Say hi to Michael and Clyde at the main bar. They will take care of you. Primrose is excellent for breakfast and perfect for anything at T-MOBILE.  Thanks
40,Overall good experience but not the “best” you’d expect from the name. Rooms were average but very clean. Would have been nice to have more amenities but hey who needs a fridge anyways! The receptionist who checked us in must’ve been having a bad day because we did not have the best experience from people you’d expect to represent the organization accordingly. Good thing other hotel staff were more receptive and grateful for the business. Again good experience but definitely opportunities for improvement.
40,I stay 3-4 times per year. Paid $40 for early arrival. My room 5-223 had a view of a wall!! I would think my gambling “loss” history would earn me a really nice room!! Dallas and Mary on Texas hold right table game are more than awesome! The no smoking policy is grest
50,Loved the hotel room view. We were 3hrs early to check in. The front desk was understanding and let us do early check in with no extra cost.  House cleaning was really quick and helped us with toiletries as and when needed in no time.
10,I was disappointed with the hotel room. The shower was dirty and the windows had really bad water spots which took away from the view of the strip. Bed was really uncomfortable to sleep in and the room itself just wasn’t nice. We joke and called it our “motel”.
40,Park MGM is very centrally situated in the thick of a lot of action along the strip. So many eateries walkable from the location. Check out Eataly Best Friend La La Noodle and so many more! Catch the Las Vegas Knights playing! Hear the cannon sound off every time they score!!  The standard rooms are small but adequate. No refrigerator. Overall very clean. You’ll get a decent nights sleep.
50,What a fabulous place to stay play and rest! The Eataly area is outstanding with so many choices for food and drinks! The shopping is great too! Check in can be app initiated which saves time...same with check out! Very good value convenient location on the strip and customer service is outstanding!
50,Last minute trip to Vegas for a work function and was able to get a great room at Park MGM. I was at Eatily 2-3x a day and had an excellent time overall. The only feedback would be the efficiency of service for coffee-only choices were Starbucks and Lavazza. You would think they’d have a system for moving people among quicker. Waits each morning were over 20-25 minutes until ordering. That’s the only thing but I will be back for sure!!
10,Found the smokeless casino nice and the main lobby areas were beautiful. However the rooms not so much. Dirty absolutely no water pressure in the shower! Location is ideal for Allegiant stadium but certainly not worth the dreaded hotel room.
50,Our stay at the Park MGM was absolutely perfect! The hotel is centrally located on the Strip (between New York New York and the Bellagio) completely smoke-free (even the casino). Our room was clean and quiet with a comfortable bed and great shower. We will never stay anywhere else on the Strip again!
20,The hotel mattress was too soft shower water pressure too low no refrigerator nor coffee machine can't even get hot water without room service I would not choose this hotel again would not recommend neither.
50,We want to thank Hank as he was very personable and knowledgeable with the area he patrols which happens to be in the wine section at the Eataly at the Park MGM. He’s very passionate and had great tips regarding the happy hour.He’s a true asset to your team. He made us feel welcome.
40,I would recommend the Park MGM to my friends and relatives who are interested in a visit to Las Vegas. I enjoyed the Lady Gaga show in the theater. The food was delicious especially in Eataly. Yo need another Starbucks because the line in the morning was long.
10,My room on a non smoking floor stunk of cigarettes so bad I could hardly sleep and got a sinus infection. My room was not appointed well odd furniture old bed and small outdated bathroom with an old tub.  No coffee maker and the Starbucks line was over an hour so the ½ mile (verified) walk to Eatily seemed logical but that had a huge line too as did check in.  You can’t pay me to return to this mess.
50,This was my wife’s and I first experience in Vegas and we had such a blast at this hotel. The Vegas experience was amazing we had an amazing time with our friends and and extra bonus was the smoke free casino!!!
20,This hotel would be adequate for the price if it weren’t for the terrible condition of the room. Room had not been well maintained. Stains and nicks on furniture were not repaired. Worst was housekeeping. There were several places where it was obviously dirty. There were no glasses or cups in the room at all. No water (except tap) provided
50,Great place to stay right off the strip and easy to get in and out. Modern rooms great choices for food and gaming. Friendly staff and great comps if part of the rewards program through M life rewards.
50,Spent The Weeknd in Vegas for both hockey and football games and it’s the perfect spot on the strip for quick easy access to both venues. Across the street to T-Mobile arena amd a quick tram ride over to the walking bridge at Mandalay Bay
40,I'm totally in love with the Aria but not the riff raff. There are three reasons why I'm choosing Park MGM over the Aria. #1. No smoking means I don't smell weed from the riff raff who think they can do whatever they want. #2. Great selection of bars and restaurants. And since the hotel is seems smaller everything seems closer. #3. Convenience. ABC store is right across the street T-Mobile Arena is right next door and you're in the middle of 4 MGM casinos. The friendly and helpful staff is on par with the Aria. I'll stay here from now on.
30,I found the rooms to be a bit dark and dated. Our bathroom could definitely use a fresh coat of paint and the carpet was stained. Highlight was the spiced fried chicken and drinks at Bavette's. Overall I wasn't impressed.
50,We spent four days here with another couple and were very pleased. It was nice staying in a completely smoke free environment. Staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful. The value was definitely apparent based on the quality.
50,A very clean and comfortable hotel! Will stay here again!  Very friendly employees and a great experience.  The hotel is near almost everything on the strip and your room will give you a great view of it!
50,Love the no smoking hotel and casino. Would have liked a basic place to eat that was not so expensive or confusing Eatily was not great for me but I’m not a big fan of seeing raw food. Would have liked a basic burger or sandwich shop or even a buffet. But besides this staff and room was awesome. I will always book here when I visit.
40,Resort was very clean and having a non-smoking casino was a plus. Eataly has so much food to try...definitely get an espresso. Used the free Tram to get around the area which was convenient as well.  Mobile check in was a breeze my digital key didn't work right away so I did have to print some cards up. But that was easy as well at the kiosk. After that no other issues.
30,Location is excellent! Loved having Eatly so close by. The lobby was very nice and clean staff was friendly beds are comfortable.  The rooms and bathrooms could use an update/major cleaning. The hallways are smelly and dark. There was an issue with checking in and I still have not received my receipt after 12 hours from checking out. For the price self parking should have been included. We were woken up at 5:00 by smoke/smell of marijuana by the people in the room next to us. You can hear every tiny sound and smell coming from next door. I know the hotel states “smoke free” but it’s not very implemented for people in rooms.
50,Employees were fun and helpful. the Italian food court has great food  Ate all our meals there. Bartenders remembered us and our drinks from the night before fun to converse with. rooms clean and bed was so comfortable I'm going to buy the same soon
50,My assistant and I stayed in a double queen bed while in town for Wedding MBA. We were emailed the app to check-in prior to our arrival but utilized the check-in desk anyways. Check in was quick and easy although I didn't expect the $100/night deposit so that was a shock. The hotel was quiet at in the hallways and the beds were SUPER comfy. Housekeeping replenished everything daily and even came to clean our room while we were in it during one of our down days. Our conference members used Mama Rabbit for a networking mixer and it's a pretty cool space. I'd definitely stay here again.
50,This is a hidden gem GREAT hotel on the strip for the non smoking experience. Our room smelled wonderful and so did the casino. After being in many casinos with smoking this was a big deal. It also has a tram that connects to Aria and Bellagio which is great and saves money and time for foot traffic. I would highly recommend to anyone who doesn't want to deal with the smelly cigarette smoke or marijuana odors that penetrate your hair and clothes. Plus the resort fee is not too bad and cheaper than Aria and Bellagio. Only tried the restaurant Primrose during my stay for breakfast but it was very delicious. I will have to try the restaurants at EATALY next time.
10,Park MGM is the McDonalds of Strip Hotels. The check in person was as interactive & friendly as a bag of sand. The hotel was empty however we were given a room as far away as possible from the elevators a room as noisy as possible facing the T-Mobile Arena & all of its noise. The Park MGM does not recognize high value Expedia status. What a joke.
10,As non-smokers who have stayed for years at Aria my best friend & I were really looking forward to staying at the new Park MGM. We did not realize that the Park MGM rooms are a substantial downgrade from Aria.    Areas of disappointment include:  * single-sink vanities that preclude more than one person getting ready at a time  * tiny dresser drawers so small that we had to keep our clothes in our suitcases instead  * conditioning shampoo instead of shampoo & conditioner. Conditioning shampoo is the toiletry equivalent of the spork: cheap inadequate & frustrating to use.  * shower faucet design: the shower door is on the wrong side of the stall so you cannot turn on the shower without getting sprayed with cold water  * lack of bathrobes  * no minibar  * no bathtub    I don’t understand why MGM would create such a low-budget experience especially since most of its guests would likely pay a premium for a smoke-free atmosphere. Honestly Park MGM feels more like a La Quinta or a Quality Inn than an MGM resort. We certainly won’t return.
40,Minor issues with very loud neighbors as many of the rooms are connecting so you can hear a lot. My digital key never worked so had to get keycard. Beds were very comfortable; great location and love the non smoking environment.
30,Only one bar! Yeah be ready to wait in line! The restaurants are exceptional but if your their to gamble it’s too small and to get a drink comped from the bar good luck tight old guys they act like their hands are tied literary
40,I've stayed in much nicer boutique hotels for about the same amount of money. It is Las Vegas so getting a good location resort hotel was worth it. The room is okay no fridge or any goodies to keep me in there for more than freshening up and sleeping. No problem! It's Vegas! Go out and have fun! I was very happy with my stay and exploring the strip. The casino was great: smoke free clean and always ready for me. :) M life rewards card is convenient and my one of the reasons I will continue staying at Park MGM.
40,The tram that takes you all the way to The Bellagio is convenient! I also enjoy that the entire property is smoke free. I did get billed incorrectly for some room service and had to wait until the weekend passed to speak with a manager to resolve the issue. Hopefully everything will be resolved… fingers crossed.
50,Non smoking is amazing! Two queen strip view rooms are awesome lack a little storage for clothes and things but the beds are comfy! The shower is refreshing! The overall room is nice and has a newer feel!
30,Digital Key access to the room didn't work even had a check in employee try it still a failure. Other than that it was nice being a non-smoking hotel and casino. The walk from the self-parking garage is not as far as some other strip hotel. The tram to Crystals and Bellagio was nice to have to avoid walking or driving!
50,I’ve stayed in Vegas several times before and at other MGM properties. I’ve never had a poor experience but the ParkMGM is my new favorite. Well appointed rooms great food choices and very clean! Eately is a fabulous surprise that is so much better than a food court. Real food prepared authentically. Contact free check in with the app easy on-site parking and access to elevated walkways and tram. I’ll stay here again for sure.
40,I've been to Vegas 15 times and I feel that the Park MGM is a solid choice that doesn't get the love that it deserves. The rooms are clean and modern. The pool is fun and inviting with amenities. The dining choices thou not plentiful are diverse and have a great vibe. Eatily can be hit or miss but it is a really cool spot to grab a quick bite & people watch. It's hopping on an evening that the Knights are playing. You are literally in front of the arena. The tram gives you access to Aria & Bellagio. You are next to the NYNY & across from MG Grand. My son and I are booked to go back for another wonderful stay at the Park MGM & Nomad. We stayed at the Nomad last trip which is a hotel within a hotel. Check that place out. Really cool 40's retro vibe. I've stayed at many resorts in Vegas and I really like the Park MGM.
40,This Hotel has a great location to everything especially if your going to the LV Golden Knights game. Also really good food options especially Best Friend restaurant. And I like how clean everything was also. Definitely would stay here again.
50,We be back I found my new home. Next time we be a family trip . The staff was awesome and very friendly . Down to the Valet parking even get the five star very friendly polite very helpful knowledgeable
50,We had a great experience at The Park MGM. We loved the smoke free environment and clean smelling casino. I wish Las Vegas had a more relaxed mask mandate but understand. I would definitely stay there again!
50,The location is incredible. Rooms are large and quiet. Wonderful selection for eating. Staff very friendly and always willing to take time to help out. Love that it is all a NO SMOKING place to stay. Within walking distance to almost everything.
50,We stay here every year and will be back next year. All of the staff we encountered was very helpful and friendly. The clean rooms are very clean and spacious. There is a large variety of food options located within the property.
50,What I love most about the Park it is smoke free. The room are very spacious and are further back from the strip which means less street noise in your room. It's an easy walk from the Parking garage to the Hotel and Casino.
40,Great stay for the price. I did see some minor flaws one being that the sink doesn’t drain the water as fast as I believe it should I think it might be clogged and another minor thing that I noticed is that by the bed area there was a lot of dust were the wood board is underneath the mattress
40,Pleasant stay very clean and convenient. The MGM app is slow to load when using it as an electronic key and can cause delays. Aside from that the location is great the staff very helpful and the restaurants were good.
40,Room was nice and clean however no dresser for clothes. Staff were helpful and friendly. Getting a cup of coffee in the morning is a joke. None in the rooms and only two takeout locations in the hotel. Each morning the line was at least a half hour wait.
40,Came out for SEMA to meet up with some colleagues booked a king bed room at Park MGM ended up with a double bed room. returning flight home was and evening departure checked with the front desk the night before about late checkout I was told it was available for a charge which was $50 great price the following morning I called down to set it up and was told nothing was available. Hotel is nice but customer service accuracy lacks.
50,Clean hotel nice people great security and best of all smoke free. The view could have been better…… we had an amazing view of the air vents. Lol. Bed was more comfortable than some hotels but not as good as others.
50,Great value and clean updated property. Convenient to all attractions on the strip. Self parking was easy and love the lights that indicate available parking spaces. Staff was friendly and responsive.
40,We enjoyed our stay however we did not eat therewas not impressed with the eataly or other spots. Which was not an issue ate our meals at the MGM and New York New york which are walking distance had great time.
50,Refreshing stay (the property is smoke free and it is obvious in the casino). Loved Eataly and the variety of foods and experiences. Friendly staff. Rooms could use more storage but overall very clean.
20,Our experience was just okay. When we checked in the staff was very unfriendly. Then we had to call customer service because our key wasn’t working and they were rude on the phone as well. Dark hallways. Slept terrible because they have paper thin walls. Great shower pressure. Clean rooms. Overall experience was okay. Wouldn’t stay again though.
50,Had a great time here. Food was solid at Primrose and Eataly. Room was a good value for what you pay and clean and smoke free. Small but non smoking casino was clean with professional staff across the board. Looking forward to staying again on my next visit.
50,Spent 2 nights. The rooms were quite comfortable. The hotel was very clean. Personnel were friendly. Appreciated my room was ready when I arrived (a bit early). Primrose had good breakfast (Las Vegas over priced but good). Not a big gambler but I did a little. So nice to not smell smoke. Again -- very clean. I would definitely stay again. Good price for what you get.
50,We've stayed at Park MGM now twice and love it both times! You can't beat the location right on the strip but we love the service the rooms the comfy mattresses and pillows the casino and everything else the hotel has to offer! Would highly recommend and you can't beat the price if your an M Life Rewards member!
50,My first time staying here and I was pleasantly surprised. It's a really good location walking distance to many places. Nice room and I liked the heavy drapes they kept the room dark at night. The AC unit was quiet also. Best room prices also. I'll definitely be staying here again!
50,The MGM Park is the place to stay. It is very convenient to most every thing. The # 1 reason is the Hotel is 100% SMOKE FREE No smoke anywhere. They have people watching making sure you are wearing your mask also. I would Definitely stay there again.
10,The room was very basic. But what I expected. Just what I needed for this trip. However you can hear the noise from the street at all hours of the morning. It would be fine if it went until 2ish. but 3 4 5 in the morning you can still hear the music!
50,I stayed here years ago when it was the Monte Carlo and last time I was in Vegas they were still finishing up the remodeling. We stayed in October to see the Marc Anthony concert and I was completely happy and impressed with the new hotel. The addition of the casino being non smoking is great. The Restaurant choices in the property are good specially Crack Shack right outside the hotel. The location is perfect as you are a walk away from the T Mobile Arena and other restaurants near New York New York. The rooms were comfortable I thought I was going to dislike the layout of the room but once I came in it was very chill and relaxing. And the room prices were reasonable I will definitely be coming back to Park MGM.
50,This is the first time staying since the big remodel. Really helpful and friendly staff. Best of all its location is in the center of the strip. Lots of choices for eating even an ABC store across the street.
50,Love this place close to everything and so relaxlng will stay here all the time and have like six times in the past.we want to make it our late fall getaway spot before we go away for winter time in the sun
50,Easy check in once got the app to work. No need to wait in line. Room was fine loved the bed and pillows. Cleaning of room prompt and thorough. Pool area is low key with 3 different pools - perfect if not up for day pool partying. Great location with easy access to a variety of entertainment dining experiences. Aside from location best part is the smoke free environment.
50,We enjoyed our time at the Park MGM. We were pleasantly surprised. The hotel and room have a modern feel. The bed and shower water pressure were amazing. Everything is easy to get to and the staff was kind and courteous. We would definitely recommend!
40,Booked a room in advance for a king-size bed for me and my wife’s wedding anniversary was told upon arrival that there were no longer any king size beds available and was down graded to a queen size bed I was very disappointed because it was my first time at the Park MGM and it was my wedding anniversary.
50,I booked this property for it's proximity to T-Mobile Arena and the fact that is a 'No Smoking' property. The room was not fancy but it was very clean and quiet. I would definitely book this property again.
50,Definitely the place to escape the smokey casino's really loved it the clean air made sleeping exceptional in my experience highly recommended by me and my family primrose great for breakfast and lunch
50,Hotel was amazing  beautiful clean and the Italian food court was so Amazing! Wine steakoysters breakfast was so good! The Vide was Fun!! Will recommend to my friends to stay here and stay here again!
50,I will be back on December 25. Had a great time. Love the restaurants and bars. I didn’t win any money. Lol This trip was business and I’m coming back over the 25 for a week and it will be a pleasure trip with my wife.
40,Everything was amazing. Our only complaint is having to wait until 7:00 before orders ring morning coffee which meant it was 7:30 before first cup. It would be nice to either supply a coffee pot or allow night before orders that can arrive before 7:00. Other than that we loved everything.
50,Really enjoyed the fact the hotel was a smaller property and was no smoking. Restaurants are all really good and enjoyed the smaller no smoking casino. I stayed in a stay well room and appreciated the upgrades in my room.
50,This was the best time we’ve had in a long time! The room was wonderful although two people really go to Vegas to sleep? No but the bed was awesome!We had a nice view And the staff was friendly and helpful
50,This was a quick weekend trip to see Sting and see a few sites. Park MGM was a great choice with convenient location outstanding service and smoke free hotel AND casino. Eataly restaurants provided exceptional food/pastries. We look forward to returning. The MGM app made check in and out seamless.
50,I love this place. I love that it is non-smoking. I like the the atmosphere of the smaller casino and the all the employees are great! The location is convenient and the tram to other hotels is a plus.
40,Overall a nice hotel I would go back in a heartbeat. Really enjoyed Bavette’s (I recommend you make reservations early) Primrose (breakfast was a real treat) and Junipers (the Gin drinks were very good).
50,You will not regret this decision. Close to mid strip and walking distance to Target NyNy MGM etc and the bus stop to Fremont if that's more tiur speed. All the amenities food and shows available at a huge casino with no smoke and a beyond friendly staff? Count me in.
50,I love the fact that this hotel is smoke free. I don’t feel or smell like an ashtray when I gamble and walk around inside. I love staying here. It’s close to everything including stores. I highly recommend this hotel if you’re sensitive to the smell of cigarettes.
50,This was a two night stay. We had a wonderful check in. Quick and friendly. The room was spacious and clean. Being a non smoking facility was a big plus. The casino workers were great and very friendly. The Eataly Area All Italian food kiosks was Fantastic. Best Pizza ever! We will be back!
30,My visit was a little of a surprised of the outdated rooms and amenities. Room had old furniture with scratches in it. The hotel had limited places places to dine and have drinks with friends and family members.
50,Very helpful staff! Clean and comfortable room. Easy check in/ check out. Ideal location on the strip! Variety of eating options. The best residency in Vegas (lady Gaga)! Amazing venue! Thank you for an amazing experience!
50,From staying in other properties park MGM was a very pleasant one. The room was very clean and spacious what I loved about my stay was that the monorail was working so you don’t have to Uber yourself the park is non smoking so that is a plus and the anemeties like eataly is very nice I highly recommend it it’s not as far as the MGM grand so everything is centrally located so that is a plus for walking down the strip
50,The Park Mgm has an excellent event theater - recently hosting Lada Gaga Bruno Mars and John Mulaney is also about 200 feet from the t-Mobile arena and about a quarter mile from Allegiant Stadium. The suites are quite nice the VIP hosts are excellent and the hotel is smoke-free which is a huge deal for me - high recommendation!
50,Hotel was beautiful and staff were exceptionally polite and provided friendly services. Location was close to I-15 and The Strip. Casino services were attentive to gamblers needing assistance at slot machines.
50,I stayed at the Nomad which occupies the top four floors of the Park MGM. My King room was spacious and clean but the bath was a bit worn. Amenities like make up remover pads a shower cap cotton swabs and real glass drinking cups were a nice touch. Housekeeping was thorough and efficient and the concierge and related services were outstanding.
50,I stayed at Park MGM for a couple night during EDC weekend. Though I'm not into that type of music i am definitely into finding great hotels at an excellent price. I stay at vegas hotels on a pretty regular basis and I can confidently say that Park MGM is the best value for your dollar almost anywhere on the strip. Bavette steakhouse was delicious and the Spa is first rate!
40,Nice option for Non Smokers in Vegas. Fun casino good food options the Eatery had good choices for lunch and dinner. Breakfast options were limited. The rooms could use some work and bed is extremely firm.
50,The property was exceptionally clean and the casino had a drink girl always there my wife felt safe and secure the food court was very responsible and reasonable there was someone always there from securityI’LL BE BACK!
50,Love it see you next time hopefully I get  Mlive gold membership Everyone was great just the room was too small but everything else was good I can’t wait to see you guys  Please let me know about gold membership and why I lost so money on black jack.
50,We really enjoyed our stay at Park MGM. Stayed for the week for SEMA. Loved the non smoking and Italian food court called “Eataly” The beds were comfortable and the rooms were dark and quiet so we slept very well too.
50,We enjoyed our stay at Park MGM Las Vegas. It was really clean and staff super friendly. I like the mask enforcement regardless of vaccine status. Will love to stay there again. Totally recommend to stay at the Park MGM.
50,Clean room and very nicely designed. The rooms have been refreshed since I stayed there a few years ago. I really like being able to check in check out and open the door with the app. It was also nice to walk around the Park. I’ll be back for a hockey game!
50,Checked in with cell Got room keys digital clean room excellent staff  I thought food selection was limited only down fall We ate next door @ New York New York everyday Only breakfast sandwiches good @ Eataly Steak house super high Or hamburgers
50,Me and my husband enjoyed our stay room was clean. Check in was easy customer service through the hotel was great. Thank you Alexis for the medical fridge. It was well needed. They also have a Starbucks in the lobby and the restaurant was good.
40,Stayed here because we were seeing Lady Gaga on the last night of her tour. The hotel and casino are non-smoking which I really enjoyed. The hotel is very clean and the rooms are nicer than at least half you find on the strip. Nice place to stay if you like your clothes not smelling like you spent all night in a sleazy bar.
50,This is the hotel you want to be at when you come to Las Vegas! The location is in the center of everything! You can park and walk to any location and then return to clean comfortable room. The parking garage is easy to access as well.
50,I enjoyed my stay at PARK MGM. The staff was friendly and helpful in every way. The rooms are smoke free and very clean. The pillows are so comfortable which made it easy for me to sleep. The pool area is very clean and relaxing. The Primrose is a great place to eat and located near the pool. All in all Park MGM is a perfect location close to nearly everything on the Vegas Strip. I will be coming back 2022.
30,rooms were nice wish bathroom had a fan and locks. rooms did not include any refrigerator no room service was worth getting. storefronts like starbucks had lines wrapped around the main hall every morning.
30,No refrigerators in rooms  Bed are wonderful  Rooms were clean  Air conditioner never got real cold  So not cool enough for me  Two people in room only towels/wash cloths for two no extras unless you call. Carpets in hallways pretty stained up
40,Room Type: 2 Queen  Travel Type: Family Vacation - 2 adults one teen  Length of stay: 1 night    On a recent family trip our red-eye departure flight ran into snags and our early Sunday morning departure was pushed back to Monday. It was about 2:30 am Sunday when we were done wrestling with the airline and decided to try to just grab a little sleep in the airport and deal in the morning with finding a place to sleep Sunday night.    The Park MGM was listed on the MGM app as one of the least expensive options. I booked the room on the app from the airport at about 6:00 Sunday morning and we headed to the hotel to at least drop our bags at the bell stand and head for breakfast.    We arrived at the hotel at 6:30 am exhausted and hungry and were beyond grateful when we were given a room right away! THANK YOU Park MGM!    Although one of the less expensive MGM properties this hotel was great. Updated clean smoke-free. Having Eataly in the hotel was great. The casino / gaming areas are a bit small.    We had spent our actual stay at Vdara which is set quite far back from the strip. Our one night here made us appreciate how convenient it is to be situated right on the strip - it was so quick and easy to walk over to New York New York or to get across the street!    There is only one thing that would keep me from booking this hotel in the future... if you are traveling during pool season and sunshine is important to you this might not be the hotel for you. The Park MGM pool area is spacious with multiple pools and chairs are plentiful. It's an attractive well-maintained pool area. But... it's just not situated well. Surrounded by tall buildings I'd estimate that less than 20% of the chaises were ever in the sun. To be fair this was in early November when the pool was actually supposed to be closed for the season already and the sun is generally lower in the sky but I have to imagine this might be somewhat of an issue year-round.    Oh - one comment for anyone who is concerned one way or another about masks. This hotel was the most strict about mask wearing. Security and hotel staff were enforcing proper mask wearing... approaching not just people who weren't wearing one but folks who had the mask below their nose. More vigilance here than anywhere else we encountered on our trip.
10,On the first day upon check in my boyfriend who’s name I added to the reservation and even sent had the digital key went downstairs to try and change our room. The very mean and rude front desk lady locked him out and told him he can’t go back to the room with all our belongings inside. What if he had an asthma attack and couldn’t go back upstairs to get his inhaler??? What if he didn’t bring his phone and couldn’t call me? He was told he had to wait for me to come back and then they can unlock the room. I have never ever received such terrible service from a hotel front desk before. Terrible- will not recommend to ANYONE.    Also trying to call for housekeeping was a nightmare. We left the room 3x that day to accommodate the maids and our room was never cleaned. When it was finally made. They didn’t refill the toilet paper or tissue box or replace the used cups.
40,I was in Vegas as a group for a friends 50th. PARK MGM is the first non-smoking casino and hotel on the strip. Our group selected Park MGM because it was non smoking. It is so nice to not go to bed without buring eyes and smelling of cigarette smoke.    Room - I am an MLife Platinum member so my husband and I stayed in a comped Nighthawk King Suite. The layout is a little weird and decor not really my style. I do think they missed the mark remodeling these rooms. The bed was comfortable. Bathroom only has a shower no tub. I don't use the tub in Vegas so I good with no tub. One no we paid for a 3pm checkout had the do no disturb on the door but the maid still came into the room while my husband was resting. Seems to be a pattern from other reviews.    Restaurants - There is a variety of restaurants and an easy walkway to Aria for additional restaurant options.    Casino - I would consider the casino small compared to many other strip casinos but the non smoking sells it for me. My husband and I love to play table games but they do not have a large variety of games and the tables are often full. Despite the lack of variety I still prefer to play her simple for the fact I don't have to have a chain smoking sitting next to me. I know smokers will be offended by this but I am not a smoker.    Check in - hands off type of hotel everything is through the app or on a pad in the lobby. The app key can be hard to get to in the elevator make sure the key app is ready before the elevator door closes.    Honestly if I was going off just the room there are much nicer rooms on the strip at other MLife casinos I could chose from but the non smoking environment sells me on this hotel and casino 100%.
40,Love the renovations gave 4stars due to television not working. Everything else was nice. Great staff and customer service. My family stayed here several times before when it was still the Monte Carlo. It was really nice then but the standards are at a higher level now. Great shops and love the Italy food court area. Definitely a great twist.
50,The hotel was clean spacious and smoke free which is what attracted me to this hotel. There were many choices for food and the staff was amazingly friendly. The room was very roomy and comfortable and I enjoyed the long couch along the window.
30,Park MGM is by no means luxurious but it provided a comfortable and clean place to stay which is what we needed.    Pros: Everything is digital which is very convenient especially the digital key. The room was clean. Location is great and the fact that it is non smoking is a great plus! We enjoyed Bavettes! They also extended my check out by 1 hr for free.    Cons: While going digital has its benefits I did have some issues. I requested a higher floor but literally got the lowest floor even though it was a Sunday night. I would have gone to the front desk to request a change but the line was too long. Also I did add my wife to the room on the app but when she tried to charge something to the room they said she wasn’t on there. The daily fee of $35/night PLUS $15/night for parking is way too much. That’s an extra $50/ night! They should really just include these charges on the room rates but I guess they want to appear cheaper. The pool was closed even though it was 80 degrees so I don’t know what we’re paying for. I know most Vegas hotels have these fees but this is the first to have a separate charge for parking! Water pressure was also way too strong!
50,The fact that his hotel is smoke-free is a game changer for Vegas! We enjoyed the design of the room the ease of checking in on the app and connection to the Nomad. We also enjoyed having Eataly at the hotel.
50,enjoyed the quick check in. even though i’m a smoker i enjoyed the cigarette free zone but was able to smoke outside with no hassle. walking distance from good restaurants and arena which i was attending an event at.
30,Was ok but shower leaked all over floor and food choice is very limited in the hotel. If you just want a room this is good place but to eat and do other things I would go to another hotel where things are more lively.
20,If you want to accumulate points this is not the program. No one credits automatically and if you saved receipts you only have the option of spending your vacation in the long cashier line at the casino in order to correct it.
50,This was my 3rd time in Las Vegas and staying at ParkMGM. Always a great stay. Location location location. They have friendly staff. Lots of choices of place to eat. Always recommend ParkMGM to people going to Las Vegas. Oh only non smoking hotel on the strip.
50,The non-smoking facility is great. Unfortunately there is smoking right outside the door. Staff were incredibly helpful kind and responsive. Having Eataly with a variety of food choices is nice. Cleaning staff were friendly. The Gran Bar staff on 11/5 wasn't very responsive worse on 11/7.
40,Enjoyed our recent 3 night stay. Clean and quiet guest rooms. Casino was fun as no one was smoking.  Restaurants are a bit pricey. But this is Las Vegas. Enjoyed the free tram ride to the Bellagio but we also walked all over the strip.
40,We stayed at Park MGM when we went to an event at T Mobile Arena. The hotel and casino being within walking distance was very convenient. Not having to pay for or wait for a taxi or ride share saved us a lot of time and money. The matters in our room could use and upgrade but otherwise it was terrific.
40,Three relaxing nights at the park MGM was just what the doctor ordered. Wonderful calming smoke free environment while being very close to all The action! Not only is Eataly a perk it is a Vegas Must!
40,Hotel staff reached out to me quite fast regarding this review. While it’s unfortunate that this happened they definitely care for their guests and fixing their overall view on the hotel and rooms. While this doesn’t fix everything overall it’s definitely nice that they do care. To me that counts for a lot. Enough for me to consider them again in the future just checking my sheets before sleeping.    Check your sheets and trash!  Review of Park MGM Las Vegas  Reviewed 2 days ago  Our sheets had balls of hair in them. Turn down service (ignored the opt out of service ) and replaced bed sheets with stained bed sheets. A/C not that great either. Room  Was average. No fridge but full minibar ? Dirty hand prints on walls and mirrors  Date of stay: November 2021
50,Everything was exceptional non smoking rooms and casino were a huge advantage sitting at the casino tables without smoke was the best everyone in the hotel and casino were very helpful and polite great place to stay and my go to for now on in Vegas.
40,Stayed at PARK MGM for SEMA. The price was exceptional. This was my first visit since EATALY was there. This is a wonderful touch. The best part is PARK MGM is a non smoking property. Looking forward to my next trip. My current plan is to stay at PARK MGM.
50,Park MGM is doing it right with providing a smoke free environment for the entire family and animals.    I found that smokers also like the smoke free gambling and all the great places to eat without second hand smoke. Varity was key to not even wanting to leave the grounds for other places to eat or gamble.    Entire staff from check in places to eat to house keeping were friendly and helpful and the facility was meticulously clean to include the room we stayed in with a great view of the strip.    This is our new go-to venue for future visits.
50,We had a fantastic time at Eataly and while enjoying the best wine pours in Vegas (HH 3-5p) we tasted exceptional dishes from various parts of Italy. Everything we had was amazing.  The folks in Eataly were very nice and helpful especially a security guard named Hank G. We simply asked his a question about other spots to go in the hotel and he had great info to share. He pointed us to Nomad Bar and this did not disappoint. We had amazing cocktails created by Chris and you have to try the truffle hotdog.  We had a wonderful day at the Park MGM.
50,First time at a mgm property won’t be the last sorry rio better roomsbetter service and the bars and restaurants are open on the property. Can’t wait to come back. They gave me a two night comp for my birthday which was a great star. Thanks park mgm.
30,Hotel is ok but interior is dated and needs more restaurants. Entire property is non-smoking which is a plus. We stayed here because of a convention but would probably seek out other arrangements if the schedule was back here.
30,Overall the hotel was nice with a smoke free casino. Too much digital processing at check-in. Made you feel like your only another dollar to the hotel and not a guest at the hotel. The food choices in the Etaly were good however sometimes the lines were a little too long.
50,The location is perfect ! We were going to Phish concert at MGM Grand Arena and it is a 10 minute walk. Eataly was convenient and very enjoyable. Need more late night food options. They were very accommodating since out flight got us to the hotel at 10. They had us in a room by 11 and gave us a late check out.  Location location location.
40,Stayed for the weekend. Good location and staff were all so nice. Love that it’s smoke free. I do wish that there was a refrigerator in the room. Casino is small but there are plenty good slots and tables.
10,Terrible accommodation for a 10th anniversary. Nothing was done to help upgrade or at least a food comp. Luckily I had a m life food comp. Spent a lot of money gambling and dining. Pretty sad since my wife and I loved staying here in the past.
30,If you’re looking for a room that’s close to T-Mobile or MGM Grand Arena then this is a good place. The red color of our room was not inviting. The bathroom doesn’t provide for privacy if you’re traveling with friends. I did like that it is a job-smoking casino.
50,We love staying at Park Mgm. Love the Eataly non smoking casino and the size and location of the casino. Ate dinner at Babette’s steak house and it was delicious. Atmosphere is old style and very classy.
10,I was told a cake could be delivered to the hotel by the staff at the bell desk. I ordered a non refundable cake. Then once we got to the hotel they said that I couldn’t have food delivered.    We were also woken up twice the morning we were leaving even though we had a do not disturb sign on the door. The first person asked if we wanted more towels. The 2nd person asked when we were leaving because she wanted to clean the room. It wasn’t even check out time yet
50,Room was great. Close Enough Walk to the MGM Grand for Concerts. Would be nice to see where a room will be or be given options when checking in. Clean behind the couches in the room please. It was a little bit gross back there.    Great Sportsbook staff as well.
50,Casino and rooms are non smoking. The staff are very friendly and if you like Italian food this is definitely the place to stay! The bar in the center of the casino is a great place to hang out watch games gamble and have a few drinks.
40,The only hotel we could find that was non-smoking and it was clean and friendly. Room decor was a bit outdated and could be brightened up - and the pillows were too stuffed for my taste. But overall great stay.
50,Man we got there on a in the middle of the week . And we left Saturday. We had a blast the whole time .. can't wait to come back ... we was right in the middle of everything that we had wanted to do or try .
50,We have stayed here a few times and we love it. I can't say enough about the layout of the games and food/beverage...everyone was friendly. We would recommend this place and any of the mgm resorts. They go over and beyond
50,If you are seeing this review this is your sign to book Park MGM Las Vegas. It’s so worth the value for money are and the location is one of the best. You have access to almost everything that you need.
50,Great place to spend four nights in the lap of luxury. Excellent accommodations wide selection of restaurants to choose from cozy casino excellent service from the support staff. A great place to gamble in the casino if that's your preference.
20,We stayed her because we booked a Lady Gaga package. The room is nothing special. The walls are PAPER thin. I could clearly hear complete conversations at 1:30AM. The blinds were on chains and were very loud when other rooms raised or lowered them. Small casino. I did like Eataly.
50,Park MGM is beautiful modern and sparkling clean - the smoke free environment is 100%. We really enjoyed our mini suite where our group met each evening before dinner. A tremendous value for the money!
20,Recently I had a business trip to Hendrickson NV. I made my hotel reservation a little bit late. I decided to stay at the Park MGM only because I could earn Workd of Hyatt points while staying there. Also it was more affordable than the other limited Hyatt properties in Vegas. I read some reviews of the hotel but unfortunately I ignored the poor reviews of lumpy beds due to the attractive weekday pricing and location. Air conditioner puts out very little cool air. I mean this is a major hotel in the desert I would think the aircon would be excellent.  The TV didn’t work half the time it kept losing the signal. I’m was not in Vegas to stay in my room and  watch TV but I do enjoy watching the news while I’m working in the evening. There was no appropriate task chair for sitting at a desk or table. They did have this awkward lounge type chair which was much too low to use properly at the ugly table in the room. I would never recommend staying her again. I’m going back to Henderson in February and already booked my hotel off of the Strip! I arrived late on a Monday and had booked the hotel for five nights. By Tuesday morning I was ready to check out. However realizing I was in Vegas this would be complicated. They were going to charge me $379 for an “early check out fee”. I decided to endure. The room itself was fine. I had never stayed at the old Monte Carlo hotel and I assume they get some upgrading but clearly they did not have a proper budget to upgrade the rooms.  Besides the problems I mentioned above they had this hideous wall mounting electrical and swag lamp hanging from the ceiling.  The electrical wiring cover was run on the exterior of the wall and outside of the ceiling. It just looked very cheap. It was awful and distracted from any of the nice renovation that was done.  They would have been much better off and certainly more attractive to use floor lamps with ambient light reflecting off the ceiling.  It’s a pity that one distraction like the crappy swag lamp detracted from the entire room because the bathroom was very nicely done with nice fixtures and the “red brick” tiles.  Lastly it irritates me when a modern day hotel room does not have a mini-fridge.  I like to have cool drinks in the refrigerator especially when I am staying several days.  On the positive side they did have a very good ice maker on my floor that I visited multiple times each day.  As a “gold” Mlife member I was supposed to get free garage parking and there was not a single day when I tried to leave the garage where I did not have to call to have the parking gate lifted to get out without paying.  With all this lack of attention to detail it is no surprise I had to send off multiple emails to get my World of Hyatt points for staying at the Park MGM.  Lesson learned.  Never again!
10,The rooms are dated okay I’ll live with that however the beds are so old you can see and feel the indentions on it it was saggy and lumpy the closet door and the restroom door share a barn style door which can be intrusive you have to manually pull up the blinds very dated hotel
20,I’ve stayed at Park Mgm for the entertainment this visit the rooms were a mess! Hair on sheets and dust everywhere !  I was expecting a higher standard of cleanliness due to CoVid but was complete opposite! Very disappointed
50,we like our stay there but there is one day that they did not do the room service on our room. we enjoy our trip there and we will coming back again there soon. it's easy to check in on mobile apps and they give our room early on the check in time.
50,Love the fact that Park MGM is smoke free. No more stinky clothes not to mention health issues.  Resort is in a great area with easy access to parking if you have a car  Great food at Eatily. Nice if smaller casino and did I mention no smokets?
20,This was my 2nd stay at Park MGM. I guess I did not remember my first experience. The room is relatively small. Amenities vary from room to room. This makes it difficult to guess what you may get in the room. Toiletries provided were a mixed from different MGM properties - not what I expect from this type of hotel. Staff were very friendly and helpful. For the price I would stay elsewhere.
50,Great food clean air exceptional service! Highly recommend this non smoking (even the casino) resort! Babette’s restaurant is top notch and there is an incredible amount of Italian options at Eataly.
50,My family and I stayed at Park MGM for my sisters 30th birthday. We had a wonderful experience with the staff. The workers were very pleasant they made sure we felt safe and our celebration a success.
20,My room faced an open area with a bandstand that played loud music with deep bass that shook the room from midafternoon until the evening The room was adequate and the staff was friendly. I was at a conference and the foot served was excellent.
50,Would most definitely recommend the MGM Park for your next stay in Las Vegas! The staff are friendly and the restaurants are outstanding. The non-smoking casino has to be the first of its kind for this size of a venue!!
50,Hanging out at EatItaly and the most amazing and friendliest security guard “Hank Graae” sat and talked to us and pointed us to the most amazing wing tasting for happy hour for $10!!! Then came out to check on us again and give us some more pointers. Super friendly and amazing service from a security guard. He knows his wine!!!
50,I’ve stayed there about 4 times now. Primarily because they offer me generous comps but it is a nice property. The rooms are fresh and clean. The casino offers a great variety of games. The restaurants are very good. I’d especially recommend La La Noodle and Crack Shack. And of course Eataly is always great if expensive.
50,Loved the mobile check-in and check out - everyone one was super nice. I love going to Eataly. It was only an overnight trip but well worth the time. I am really partial to the no-smoking casino. The concierge was very kind as were the valets.
50,The non-smoking environment was pleasant.  COVID prevention protocols appeared well prepared.  Housekeeping personnel were all very friendly & pleasant to deal with.  We had difficulty finding restaurant seating during prime dining hours.
50,My 16 year old daughter and I stayed at the Park to attend the Lady Gaga Concert at the Park Theater. This Hotel is beautiful and very clean. The staff was helpful and kind. Check in and out was simple. There were no surprise fees. Our room was clean and bright. The bed was the BEST I wish I had that brand of mattress at home! We heard absolutely no noise during our stay. The Eatley was very cool. Amazing food and gifts and the Gelato was so good!!! The fact that the entrance to the Theater is just inside the Casino was a huge plus. We were able to walk through the casino and lounge to get to our elevator at 11:30 at night rather than walk the strip or wait for a ride. I thought the location was good. The monorail is just across the street and through the MGM which was convenient. We would stay here again without a doubt! We walked through many of the other hotels exiting the Monorail of just to see the insides and the Park was by far the cleanest and most 'quality'. I was thrilled we chose to stay there. I felt very safe with my daughter and the Theater and show were fantastic!!
40,Very nice property on the strip. Room was exceptional value if it wasn't for the daily resort fee and daily parking fee. If you know that going in it's not such a shock. Fairly easy access to other properties and the free tram is located in the back of the property.
50,I tried the Spa and enjoyed the Park Theater for a couple of Jonas Brothers concerts. I especially like that this resort is smoke free. The restaurant and lounge options were fantastic as well. I hope to stay here in the future. Overall a great Las Vegas experience.
20,Room was lacking in many ways. I would not stay at this property again. Other MGM hotels gave me a much better experience. Thankfully the room was clean. Staff was friendly in general. Location on the strip is as expected. The room I had was not what I expected at all.
40,This place is amazing for the reason of it being non-smoking. That's HUGE for non-smokers in Vegas. But be warned... this hotel doesn't offer high-speed WiFi so don't expect to be on Zoom calls from your room or their conference room. Their WiFi speed is 20 Mbps down and that needs to change...it's almost 2022.
40,Enjoyed our stay at the Patk MGM. Room was nice and clean but not exceptional. No smoking policy meant a clean fresh atmosphere. The Eatitaly food area was great. Many items and variety to choose from. We ate there several times and all was delicious and worth the fairly high prices. Casino was typical for Las Vegas but on the smaller side. Staff was great. No problems. Probably will go back.
50,Hotel is underrated and literally a breath of fresh air from the other casinos. (Non-Smoking Hotel/Casino) All the staff has always been courteous and I enjoy the convenience of this hotels location compared to the others. I always choose and recommend this hotel when staying. Hope to return soon!
50,friendly atmosphere good drinks plenty of eating places easy access from parking ramp    casino is big enough and easy to find family and friends rooms are clean and comfortable and clean    location is great
50,"We love staying at Park / Nomad. The Casino and rooms are clean mainly from the recent and complete renovation from the old Monte Carlo.  Positives  1) New Clean Rooms  2) 100% SMOKE FREE  3) Great service  4) MGM perks/comps  5) Pop Slots online perks    Negatives:  1) Most rooms do NOT have anywhere to put your clothes (no dresser or hang up spot). You have to live out of your suitcase for ''x"" days.  2) Food options are NOT to out liking. But we usually just go next door to NY  NY where they have restaurant choices we like better and a better price point than Park- Nomad.    We also enjoy Cosmopolitan as well but regardless of how much money we lose/spend they never seem to give us any comps. I am hoping now that MGM has bought the rights to Cosmopolitan maybe Cosmopolitan will start being included as an option for my MGM comp stays."
50,My second time staying here. I love the area as there's so many good places to eat within walking distance.    Staff were great room clean and comfy with the best black out blinds I've experienced in Vegas! I had great sleep.    The smoke-free casino is wonderful. I only wish they had another bar with poker machines as Juniper is closed during the day and the central casino bar fills up quickly!    Check in and out via the app and using my phone as the elevator and door key was a good system.
50,This hotel has always been a favorite of mine but since it i introduced the no smoking policy i really wouldn't stay anywhere else in Vegas. The pool area is very pleasant with plenty of pool choices and this is also made more pleasant now there is no smoking. The casino area is just ok but more than sufficient for my husband and i and again made so much more enjoyable without having to deal with obnoxious smokers all night. Great value. lovely clean rooms and always a pleasant stay.
50,"I LOVED my stay at Nomad Vegas in Park MGM! Very rare to hear me say this when it comes to hotels in Las Vegas but hate smelling like cigarettes so this was the perfect place for me. Was there for a work trip so it was nice to come ""home"" to a room that wasn't so generic."
50,If you look at my record I have stay ed at MGM Park Monte Carlo so almost as many times as I visited Las Vegas which is in excess of 15 to 20 timesI I wish the noodle place had a later closing time during the week but maybe you'll come up with another restaurant that's open late that's my only request other than that I always enjoy Park MGM
40,My husband and I have stayed here before. We love it b/c it's so clean the casino the lobby everything. You don't feel packed in. The people are super nice and the Bavette's restaurant is awesome. The rooms are okay nothing fancy but they were clean. Wish they had a mini fridge and the closet door/bathroom door combo can be annoying. But overall we'd definitely stay here again! Perfect spot on the strip!
50,We are MGM property fans. We typically stay at Vdara as it's smoke free and we like to walk to Aria Bellagio and ParkMGM. We got tickets to see Bruno Mars and decided that we wanted to stay in the same hotel as the Park Theatre. To our surprise the resort had gone all smoke free just awesome. We got an upgraded room and loved the restaurants. We actually didn't want to leave the property but we did as th weather was amazing. We're converts Park MGM is our new place. Staff is great tons and tons and tons of parking and wonderful restaurants and bars. Bruno is back in December and so are we!!!
40,Tied in comp trip with convention partcipation. Sports bar and steak house were great and I stayed in Nomad....which now has closets to hang my cloths. Enjoyed the digital key on iphone and seperate Uber space for pick ups
50,Our visit to the Park MGM Las Vegas Nomad was fabulous. The staff was friendly and accommodating  and the room was well tended to during our stay.  We will recommend the Park MGM Las Vegas to family and friends as well as others visiting Las Vegas.
50,The Park MGM casino was such a fresh clean feeling to play in a non-smoking environment. Even with a mask you can smell smoke in all the others. Especially in the hotel rooms! I will definitely be returning to this one!
50,The Park MGM was perfect for our needs! Not only was our business conference held there it was close to everything and we were able to walk to everywhere we wanted to see personally. I would definitely stay here again!!
40,You have to wear a mask and forget about dining after 9pm. All the food places are closed. The hotel itself was nice and clean. Easy check in with the MGM app. No need to go to front desk. Pool was large and spacious but food service was closed only drinks. Visit LaLa Noodle if it's ever open.
50,I would 10000% recommend this hotel but don’t just take my word for it YouTube this place and you will see all the amazing reviews. The location was perfect very close to all things including food courts stores other resorts and fun outdoor areas. The room was beautiful as well as the lobby and grounds. The room bathroom was incredible the water pressure is enough to make you never want to leave the shower. Oh and the bed and linens and pillows are DIVINE !! Clean smoke free smells and beautiful modern decor throughout hotel. I can not say enough about this amazing place. Do yourself a favor and book your next stay here you won’t regret it !!
50,First time staying at MGM Park. Great location. Staff were great at front desk. Starbucks in lobby area. Good environment as well. Non- smoking was a desire but hallways as seems the be the norm everywhere these days reeked of marijuana.
50,Park MGM has it all- attractive rooms friendly staff and excellent restaurants (try Primrose for breakfast and the NoMad Library for dinner). The casino was clean and had friendly drink attendants. It’s right across the street from the T Mobile arena and within walking distance of so many hotels and restaurants. Definitely would return.
50,It was great to be back in Las Vegas and even better to be at the Park. It is a great location with T-Mobile and Allegiant Stadium within walking distance. I appreciate the non-smoking environment and felt very safe with Covid protocols in place. Will definitely stay there again.
50,We have stayed here at least 5 times over the last couple years.  Very convenient to the Strip and restaurants nearby. Smoke free environment is nice and I hear the pool is going to stay open year round. Will be back.
50,So nice to stay in a smoke free environment that's so close to everything Vegas has to offer!! The employees there were so helpful and friendly. The other resorts I have stayed just don't have the fresh air like Park MGM! Thank you
50,The room was great the staff was great. The no smoking at all in the casino was the best no sore eyes or throat! The location was central so easy to get around right by the arena and the tram is in the casino so used it several times.
50,Great facilities just wish people would believe the truth. It stymies our reopening of everything small mom & pop especially. Miss the many restaurants & artists and the people. Sad America sad.  “HEAL THE HATE EDUCATE”    Thankya thankya vurmuch VEGAS  GO KRAKEN!!!
50,The staff building amenities and service were second to none. I was worried about staying off of the strip but the MGM complex is easy to navigate and the tram is an amazing time-saver.    I've been to Las Vegas a dozen times to everything from Sam's Town to the Aria. Nomad is the best experience I've ever had.
50,I would like to thank the people working the front desk on 10/23/2021 I arrived about 2:45 in my room by 3pm i received a phone call about 5pm my father had passed away. My trip was cut short was to be checking out 10/7 went to the front to notify them that I would be checking on the morning they were very helpful and even just charged for the night. They were very kind and genuine  Again thank you  Ben Ledezma
50,I like the place for its location on the strip. It’s pet-friendly with lesser fee compared to others MGM resorts on the strip. Good restaurants on location such as Bavettes Steak House for a great dinner.
50,We stayed here for our son's 21st birthday! I really like the entire property being smoke free including the casino. So refreshing!  Rooms were nice and staff was very helpful.  We enjoyed the various types of food and appreciated the variety of coffee available too. Perfectly located in the strip and right next to the Tmobile arena.
50,We decided to stay at the park MGM because we had tickets to the Lady Gaga performance at the hotel’s Dolby theater. Turns out it was a great choice. The restaurants are fabulous and the casino was good too. The entire facility is non-smoking. We will stay there again.
50,First time I stayed and I will be back. Used my phone to check in and then as the door key and elevator pass. The room was clean and nicely furnished. Definitely not a cookie cutter room. I will definitely bet back.
40,Great package deal with VIP concert tickets and hotel accommodtions.It took a while to find our way around the hotel. The rooms were different but who spends their time in the room? Overall good experience.
50,I have never stayed in NOMAD. It was a very Cozy Suite. And thank you for the welcome card. The staff was great. From Checkin to Checkout. I truly enjoyed myself. And I will definately be back. God Bless you All.
50,What a wonderful place! Clean and organized with not a hint of cigarette or cigar smoke or marijuana stanch in the air! The dealers and pit bosses are on point! The restaurants are nice and the food is delicious!
50,We always stay at Park MGM. Great casino smoke free excellent choice of restaurants and bars. The staff are friendly and professional. We stayed in a Nightengale suite for 4 nights. The suite was spacious and clean.
50,The hotel was nice the employees were nice and professional. The rooms were nice the restaurants were good the casino was nice and not too crowded the payoff was not great but overall we enjoyed ourselves and we look forward to staying there again
50,Very secure hotel. Rooms were spotless. Room service was on time. I liked the store in the lobby had incidentals I forgot to pack. The bars closed too early! It was great having the concert in the hotel no rush to get to the room.
50,The stay was great with no issues or complaints. The price was great; we stayed during the week. We stay here again with no problem. We updated our M Life card to include my veteran identification. I plan to come back.
50,Our room was amazing beautifully decorated and very cozy we loved the soaking tub! The casino was very nice especially since there is no smoking. We ate at Primrose and Eataly both meals were excellent. I will definitely be staying at Park MGM/NoMad again.
50,This was the second time I've stayed at the Park MGM. First time was when they were transitioning to the Park MGM from Monte Carlo.    The promise was all there and the final product has delivered. The staff are as friendly as MGM resorts staff are always are and the hotel has been well kept and organized even with the covid protocols.    One of the highlights of Park MGM is their dog friendly status even including a small area outside the front entrance for dog outdoor business (with complimentary doggie bags).    The covid protocols are well addressed with ample sanitizers and even masks available at the elevator lobby (I had to use this once absent-mindedly coming downstairs early morning to walk the dog and realized I left my mask in the room). Whew!    I would recommend Park MGM to anyone traveling or visiting Las Vegas with a dog and seeking to be on the strip. The hotel hosts Lady Gaga and is right next door to the TMobile Arena and subsequently New York New York resort. There's a tram service that connects to the other MGM resorts but I had no used it (not even sure it was operational).
50,The king bed was very comfortable and big. The room was very clean and overall great. Any staff I talked to was super nice. This was our second time staying here and when we come back would like to stay again.
50,Ashley is the one you want to see at the front desk when you check in she will treat you well and make sure you have all knowledge of all benefits that there are to offer! She is kind and very knowledgeable of anything you ask her we will provide you with any answer that you need!
30,Bed placement awkward for tv. Bed very low to ground. Sliding door to bath/closet. NO DESK for laptop or charging devices. Only small trashcan in bathroom. Lots of unrelated framed photos. RED. Thought I was stepping into a bordello.
50,We had such an amazing stay at the NoMad at Park MGM but it got 1000x better when we meet Hank Graae such a special man he really went out of his way to make sure we had a fantastic time it’s people like him that make us want to come back!!
50,Great hotel - easy walk to the Grand Arena -  Room lacks a fridge- i would suggest asking for one.  Other than that its a great property - directly next to the Las Vegas Lightening arena and walking distance to everything.  The pool was very nice even in the end of OCT
20,Hotel was drab not even a mini bar in the room. room service was average at best other hotels adjacent were much nicer and modern and rooms were beautiful. for the money i would have stayed at the nomad or any other one of the 100 hotels in the vicinity.
20,Park MGM is huge and factory-like in its service (long lines for check-in hard to get attention) but that’s not super surprising for Vegas. Beds are super hard and uncomfortable; like a used futon from college. That + all the absurd up-charging ($5 waters etc) made this feel less like hospitality and more like an extractive industry where they were mining my wallet. Was a relief to get home.
10,I called the hotel directly to have big room with a good view.The receptionist was lying to me when I reserved my room. She charged me so much money more then usual even with M Life card when I arrived at the hotel after a 5 hour drive they give me a small room with an alley view. There was No housekeeping service for our room no cleaning or changing the towels and sheets.  I'll never come back to the MGM because of poor service even whit a large room payment.
50,You’re not in the middle of the strip here but if that is not of most importance this is a great hotel to stay at! Friendly and helpful staff check-in/out through app is very efficient! Comfy beds!
10,Over priced because they are the only nonsmoking casino. Room was cheap with hard as a rock beds and dirty shower curtains. The room had random rolling noises through out the night. The shower curtain had soap scum and dirt on the bottom. Missing wash cloths and in room safe was locked upon entering.
50,Love that this hotel is smoke free and that there are a lot of good places to eat. Staff is friendly and rooms are comfortable. Convenient location to UNLV where we watch the volleyball games. We make this hotel our primary go to when in Vegas.
50,Such a clean and smoke free experience! Mobile check in and check out was easy to navigate along with the great food at Eataly 🤣 staff is very helpful and kind this was our 2nd stay and we will be coming again and again 😀
50,My sons 21 birthday and first time in Vegas. We enjoyed our stay and his opportunity to visit Vegas. We spent a lot of money so we should receive more comps. We met people who told us about the comps they received. It was very different.
30,newer style casino the restaurant selection was slim the food eatery was a terrible experience zero service not recommended ok place to stay just have to leave to go get a great meal with good service.
20,This hotel boasts non smoking which is great the smoke is killer on my eyes. However don't know if I want to trade the bigger cleaner better service and luxury feel of other MGM properties ( Mandalay Bay or Mirage) to stay here again. Eataly was awesome but other food choices are limited and hours where also limited.
50,We were very happy with the smoke free environment which is why we stayed here in the first place. Park MGM did not disappoint in any way. Hotel staff were all friendly knowledgeable and professional. Eataly was also a fabulous experience great food! We'll definitely be staying here again.
50,The hotel is very clean and not that much foot traffic so being able to get to your room is super easy. My room was ready on time so I did not have to wait for my room when I got there. Definitely recommend
50,Love this casino and hotel because they don't allow any smoking in their casino which makes for a better experience while here. It's hard to gamble at other casinos when someone next to you is blowing smoke all over you.
40,The rooms were gorgeous. We were surprised that the basic King sized room came with a chair couch and table. The staff was courteous; every interaction we had with staff was easy and relaxing. The size of the hotel wasn't overwhelming; many of the other hotels we looked around were easy to get lost in.
50,Park MGM is our favorite casino. We love the quaint size. Eataly is awesome. Rooms are nice and beds are great. Staff is friendly. Never got too crowded. Check-in is a bit slow if you do it in person but not terrible. We stay here twice a year
30,Nice property poor service. Don’t expect to find an employee to help with anything. Long waits at all sit-down dining. Rooms average at best. Pillows were great bed and bedding way below average and uncomfortable. Next time would stay at Mandalay Bay or the original MGM property
40,Excellent Hotel. Rooms were very nice and clean. Comfortable bed. Well maintained and friendly staff. Hotel is at a great spot on the strip as well. Easy access to Allegiant Stadium Hockey Stadium and the strip.
50,Clean quiet & conveniently located.  Crack shack food was superb with great service. Mama Rabbit has a cool vibe. Floor staff very helpful and slot machines were friendly.  Will plan to stay here on my next visit.
40,Online check-in was easy I completed it while still at the airport waiting at baggage claim. Location and value of this smoke-free hotel and casino is near the top of the list. Very please with my second stay here since changing brands to Park.
10,Nothing remarkable at all in a good way. Just terrible rooms. Outdated decor cheaply designed. Horrible and gross rooms. Everything was dirty. No restaurants open. The whole property needs a gut renovation or tear down.
40,The Park isn't as nice as the nicest hotels but it's pretty good and one of the best values you can get. The casino is nice and they have favorable minimums and odds. There's also a great gin bar there and a On The Record is a really fun club.    The rooms are okay slightly on the smaller side but did the job fine.
30,This hotel is at most a 3 star with many issues in cleanliness room service size of room color scheme- dark dingy fake flowers everywhere but the 100% “ nailed it “ is… NO SMOKING !!! Awesome feature!  Also the concert venue is wonderful!  Excellent tram service to other properties 👍  Very inconvenient if you need to make tea or warm up something for a child or keep something cool ie medicine or child’s milk. No micro mini fridge or coffee maker.
50,Amazing friendly staff with delicious high quality restaurants located inside the hotel. Rooms are nice and quiet with the best blackout curtains. Will definitely be returning to Park MGM in Las Vegas!
50,This no smoking casino never lets us down. Everyone is very helpful. Rooms are great! Food is great! Eataly is a fantastic experience…..grab your food and go get a wine flight! Nobody seems to know about that corner……always seems to have tables available. Mlife staff took great care of us once again!
40,The hotel staff was great the location convenient having Eataly connected to the hotel amazing. The casino is non-smikoing which made us want to be there every day! The rooms were a bit dated but were clean and kept well.
30,Arrived late advance notice was given and my 2 rooms was given away. No microwave or mini refrigerator on site or within any rooms. Tv kept freezing up for short period of times. Other than those things everything else was ok.
40,We can actually breathe with non Smoking place. Eataly is a nice restaurant. Everything was alright except that room 13119 where we stayed has leaks on its shower and floods the rest of the bathroom making a messs.
50,We stayed here for 4 nights. We go to Vegas often and try to stay at different hotels each time. The Park MGM was excellent! The hotel was modern bright clean and smoke-free. Every member of the staff we encountered was very friendly and helpful. We'll be staying there again!
30,Park MGM is a clean hotel and casino. We liked the no smoking. Television in the room was glitchy.  We'll stay there again at least once in the future. (December) If we encounter no issues on that trip we will return again.
30,Non-smoking casino is very nice steakhouse us fantastic. The hotel room is horrible you can hear any sound from next door. Could not sleep. Putted sign on room door whole day and no housekeeper come to clean
50,First off of all the MGM properties we visited it was the cleanest and well put together. The hotel staff was helpful and informative. The Casino gaming had lots of option from some of the old slot machines to the newest ones available. There are lots of table games available to satisfy most gamblers. There is also an onsite sports book available if your into that. The restaurant options on site are great with a variety of foods. The location of the hotel made it easy to move around (with the tram between properties) the strip to all the shops and other casino's.
50,Great experience would highly recommend this hotel. No smoking was the added plus for this hotel. Location was good for all the things we wanted to do. Staff was very helpful with any questions you might have.
30,Rooms and halls are outdated the casino and lobby are great but the rest is outdated. Didn’t do pool area because too tired but got charged for all that when wifi sucked in our room our cell service was way faster.
50,I've been to Vegas quite a few times and what always gets me is after a night (or day) on the town coming back to your hotel just to have the hallways reek of smoke. It is a real pleasant surprise to not have to deal with that.
50,A great centrally located option on the strip. A smoke free hotel that is comfortable and well maintained. Would stay there again. Enjoyed the Eataly options for lunch and dinner. Really appreciated the location for its ease of access to the Park theater.
40,Booked the trip to Vegas earlier this year. I originally had reservations at another resort but when we tried to extend our stay there was no availability. While looking for other resorts in my AARP app I found Park MGM. The win for me was the location on the strip (close to common retail stores easy access to other hotels by foot/tram) and the smoke free property. When you walk into the lobby of the hotel it was fresh! You could walk through the entire property and not get hit with heavy smoke of any kind. Park MGM is the only property on the strip that’s smoke free. The rooms were spacious. The lounge area by the window was a plus. The beds were comfortable. Tram to Bellagio cut down on some of the walking to the other end of the strip. No major complaints. Being without a microwave and/or refrigerator for the entire stay impacted us more than I thought it would but I was aware that the property did not have these in the rooms before I booked my stay. I plan to return to Vegas next year and will stay at the same property.
50,The rooms were very comfortable except the beds were pretty soft. We were disappointed that there was no small fridge microwave or coffee maker in the room considering the price. The staff was fabulous. Very professional and yet eager to understand and meet every need.
30,Park MGM is an average stay in Vegas. It’s got a great location but the rooms leave a lot to be desired. There are some good dining options (Eataly & Bavette’s) but  need more. Property needs a poker room and an upscale night club to be a premier destination.
40,My only issues were digital parking key kept saying I was in the building when I was not. Elevators were slow about 5 minutes wait time. Either than that everything was amazing! Staff was extremely friendly and helpful! Room was clean and the black out curtains let me rest when I was in my room!
50,Love this hotel. It was a quick and easy check-in experience. Our room was ready even though we arrived a bit early… BONUS! The staff was friendly and courteous and went out of their way to help with any questions. The food options were superb. I came away a big fan of Eataly!!    I lost my phone in the casino and went into a panic because all my ID and 2 credit cards were in the case pocket. I went to the desk explained my situation and their security team responded and somehow among all the people and action in the casino found my phone. I can’t thank them enough. Can’t put a price on peace of mind. I will stay here again!!!
40,Good experience overall. Had issues at Bavettes Steakhouse with the attentiveness of service (staffing issues perhaps) and the quality of the NY strip steak. Will not go back to Bavettes on my next trip although I will come back to Park MGM.
50,If you enjoy smoke free then this is the place for you! Also very friendly staff from everyone cleaning the rooms to the bartenders! Only negative like most hotels in Vegas apparently no morning coffee unless you wait 30 minutes in line somewhere. Be prepared for that. Otherwise a comfortable bed clean spacious room I had a nice view and good food. Lots of walking to get to adjacent hotels but a great central location.
50,Enjoyed my stay at the Park MGM It was my first time there. Will definitely stay there again. Friendly staff  excellent room service . Very satisfied overall. Toured with Sweetour to the Grand Canyon.
50,Staff was very helpful and friendly. Casino Was clean love the no smoking. We like the food options at the hotel too. The rooms are a good size and they were clean and the beds comfortable. We will stay there again.
40,The shower had extreme water pressure which was great for rinsing…but almost too extreme…had to soak up water on the floor after every shower. Otherwise room was very nice and comfortable…enjoyed some food options…got good play on the slots…and loved that the casino was smoke free. Will definitely stay here again.
50,Very familiar hotel.  Excellent service.  Smoke free hotel.  Pool heated.  Spacious rooms.  Super helpful employees.  First time in Vegas and I would book again at this hotel if I ever go back to Las Vegas.
10,My son left his shirts hanging in the closet when we left the hotel. We called and emailed the hotel on our way to the airport about leaving the shirts hanging in the closet. No response! Very very disappointed!
50,There were six of us in 3 rooms on the same floor (would have been nice if we could have gotten all of them right next to each other and/or if at least two rooms adjoined but we did not spend a great deal of time in the rooms). Friendly staff felt safe great location very clean. Loved the non-smoking atmosphere.
50,Loved staying here the whole hotel is beautiful including the rooms and very affordable! Eataly is wonderful since you don’t have to walk far to get some food. And staff was friendly as well. Rooms were very clean.
50,Very clean no smoking casino is a plus for me staff was helpful and courteous. This was a short trip so location was fantastic easy walk to other hotel casino and restaurants. The weather was wonderful during this time not to warm and cool at night.
40,Wife and I stayed 2nights for our 15th anniversary. We loved that it was a smoke free casino. Also like that checkin is in back of casino close to self parking. Just overall a good layout. Pool also close to rooms gym good size food and entertainment options on par. Only one restaurant we wanted to try was closed during our stay and that was disappointing.
40,The hotel is in a great central location and has a lot of dining options. The no smoke policy in the casino was great! We had a great weekend there and would stay there again. I would recommend this hotel.
40,Park MGM is a great smoke-free property with great restaurants. Only downfall is the lack of a refrigerator in guest rooms. VIP Guest Check-in was very smooth. Great access to ride share pickups. Great location on the strip easy walk to your favorite places.
40,Easy check in and out clean and modern rooms. Casino a bit small and limited table games but good slot selections. Gaga was in town so two nights casino was partially closed bit other than that good overall experience.
50,This was a quick vacation for my partner and I. Overall a very enjoyable getaway. I rated sleep quality as a 3 only because the beds are very soft and the room thermostat did not maintain a steady temperature which interrupted my sleep.
50,"This is our first stay at the Park MGM! It will definitely NOT be our last! What brought us here was Lady Gaga's Jazz Concert! She was just phenomenal & the venue PARK THEATRE is breathtakingly beautiful & so intimate! Every seat is amazing! The ROOMS are perfect - super clean has an urban modern feel to them but so comfortable beds towels long sofa by the window! OFF THE RECORD is a great place to grab a drink listen to some amazing DJs that play such a variety of dance music from every decade! I never saw the dance floor empty the whole night! The drinks were great! It gave the vibe of a private dance party - especially with their inside dance floor and outside with their double decker RED bus with a ""kick-ass"" DJ on one side and an amazing quick Bartender on the other side making a perfect cocktail every time! My 27 yo son and daughter and goddaughter brought me for my birthday and I tell you and there were so many celebrations that night there - it's the perfect place to party in Vegas! Lastly don't miss the pools! Yes that's plural! Great music playing there all day long and great cabanas and pool pods with shades for 3 that are perfect! The pool waitress Melissa was the best we've ever had in Vegas! Don't miss her! She suggested their Guacamole and chips - tasted truly homemade! Their burgers even the Impossible one were so delicious with homemade potato chips! You will not regret coming to the Park MGM hotel! There's so much to do there and the service everywhere is phenomenal!"
50,I will always stay at the Park MGM for my Las Vegas accomodations. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful the rooms are beautifully quaint and the fact that it’s home to Lady Gaga and her fabulous residency (not to mention the Haus of Gaga Las Vegas with all of her most iconic pieces) is the cherry on top. The price is extremely reasonable for its position on the Strip level of polish and its cleanliness. Some of the best restaurants to visit include Bavette’s Best Friend by Roy Choi and La La Noodle and Primrose. Definitely a must-see if you’re trying to feel luxurious in Vegas on a budget!
50,Service was excellent the staff was helpful and nice and we did not have one problem when checking in or out. The food was great. It was close to other casinos we had friends staying in. We weee able to find our way easily
50,The hotel is absolutely gorgeous with it's nature theme along with the super cool and not too posh but very beautiful design of the rooms it was a wonderful visit. we also really loved how efficient and helpful the app was! do not stay here without using the app! it saved us from a huge line at check in and check out! thanks park mgm!
40,Nice to stay in a fresh smelling hotel. Cigarette smell was one of the things I disliked about Vegas. Easy to get to the Aria and the Bellagio via the free tram. One downside is that there really isn't much restaurants to choose from aside from Eataly.
40,I had an uber pleasant stay at this property. No disappointments at all. The bed and pillows were divine. The access to sister properties was great and we had an exceptional time. Restaurants were great and I will be back in the not too distant future!
30,We loved our stay at the MGM Vdara hotel in July this year. I would say this stay was far less enjoyable from a creature feature stand point. Park has more Las Vegas amenities like casino and gambling but Vdara was more comfortable and accommodating for a more relaxed and enjoyable time. I guess it really depends a lot on your interest and level of travel comfort you’re after. For us we will not be going back to Park but will definitely stay at Vdara again.
20,This place is NOT conducive for more than an overnight stay as a single person.  1) There are no drawers for clothes or shelving in the bathroom for toiletries. There is also no real closet to speak of. We literally had to live out of our suitcases for our entire stay.  2) We were in the Stay Well room and the memory foam mattress was too hard; so didn't get a comfortable night's sleep our entire stay.  3) The drainage in the sink and tub/shower was very poor so every time we used them there was standing water.  4) The WiFi and even hard-wired connections do NOT provide service to the room. Part of my stay included working out of the room and I had to use my mobile hotspot in for online access. There was also no cell service in the room.  5) The walls are VERY thin I could hear the people in the room next to us so clearly that it sounded like they were in our room.    During our stay there were two events at the T-Mobile arena directly across from the building. They play excessively LOUD and bass-filled music and the loud horn when the Vegas Knights score was more than annoying.    We will NOT stay at Park MGM Las Vegas ever again.
10,I made my reservation to do a quick 36 hour casino play with the goal of spending all my time in the casino only stopping to eat and use the bathroom. I ended up spending all my time in lines waiting for everything...check in check out restaurants the few machines that worked and were decent. the machines have buttons that are stuck and not working and super old. I stayed in the nighthawk wellness suite and it smelled like dirty booty and was very noisy like someone moving shopping carts...the room was supposedly designed to help you relax. The mattress was so hard I felt like I was sleeping on a concrete floor. The shower was suppose to have some fragrance but all I could smell was this dirty butt smell. The only positive was the view of the pool and the aria and cosmopolitan where I ended up spending most of my gambling because the casino and food options were terrible. too many long lines for everything
50,The staff was very professional and helpful. It is nice that the property is non-smoking. The location was easy access to walk out onto the strip. Nice tram to other casinos if you don't want to walk. Great location! Will definitely come back again!
40,Park MGM was great. The bed was super comfy the TV was nice and the shower has great water pressure. My only issues were the fact that there was no bathtub no mini-fridge and the lines to get coffee were ridiculously long. Also it would have been nice for them to have an airport shuttle. But other than that Park MGM was perfect!
40,Good enough for a trip with the guys or the girls. Doesn’t have the WOW factor of some of the other hotels that I look for when booking family or couples get away’s. Best friends was fantastic and Eatley is convenient and delicious.
40,Overall the remodel from the Monte Carlo on the bottom floor is exceptional! Lighting on hotel floors carpet and rooms could stand to be remodeled as well. Overall awesome stay and will come back!!!!!
40,Park MGM was a lot of fun. Appreciated the staff and location. Eataly was a favorite of the group easy to find something for everyone in the group. Every piece of Food from there was amazing. Hotel was easy to navigate.
50,It was great being at a venue that is smoke free. Our company had a convention there and everything went well. The rooms were uncluttered and there was secure access to the guest floors. Could have used more affordable and gluten free menu's.
50,Excellent accommodations. Friendly & helpful employees. The check in clerk took time to coordinate our three different bookings for three days so that we didn’t have to move. Any time I had to stop a security officer to ask directions they took time to be sure I understood & even accompanied me to my destination.
50,Great location property the tram connecting it to Bellagio makes the walking less. The non-smoking across the whole property is amazing like a breath of fresh air. Loved everything about this property.
10,For the price I paid (even booking far in advance of my trip) the room was very disappointing and included Zero amenities. Not one bottle of water even at my cost no cups no ice bucket and All shops/ stores closed early so no where to purchase these necessities. Difficult room access.
10,Loud rooms bathroom dirty and sink clogged. Called front desk to help with this matter but couldn’t do anything about it since they were fully booked. I would never book a room here again. Very dissatisfied with our stay here.
30,The hotel water pressure and shower were amazing! Super comfortable bed as well! The restaurants in Park MGM can’t be beat and the location is amazing. However the guest rooms have paper thin walls and outdated renovations. The ceilings are low and the casino lacks a certain flare that places like Aria possess.
50,I came to Las Vegas to attend a Raiders game at Allegiant Stadium and a Golden Knights hockey game at the T-Mobile Center on the same day. I couldn't have chosen a better location than the Park MGM. Short cab ride to the stadium and an easy walk back. The T-Mobile Center is right next door to the Park MGM.
50,From check-in through check-out the staff was wonderful. Honestly one of the best hotel showers ever! Room was comfy and clean and surprisingly nicely decorated.Couldn't be closer to the T-Mobile Arena for sure!
50,Fully recommend this property located central to Vegas Strip activities. Smoke free is a plus! Servers were excellent…especially Mel at the pool! The Bevettes restaurant was the best a bit pricey…delicious!
40,Park MGM is great because it's smoke free in the casino and hotel rooms...this makes it better for me and family members because of the fresh air throughout the property. There should be FREE parking for all overnight guests
50,Great room and location was exceptional. The staff were friendly at all times from the housekeeper to the sports bet lady. Eataly food was excellent the prime rib sandwich and the sausage pizza were great. Will definitely be back.
30,I came with a friend for EDC. I had hidden my wristband in my suitcase left for a few hours before the event came back after housekeeping had cleaned and couldn't find my wristband anywhere. It was literally the only thing missing from my room. Even my friend's laptop was out and untouched.
50,We went to see a concert at the Park MGM Theater so we were looking for a hotel 'close by' when we stumbled on Park MGM rooms. The front desk staff (VIP check-in) was super friendly. We booked a suite and got upgraded to the next largest suite (which was amazing). I'm from Chicago so I knew Bavette's (restaurant) and it was as good as ever. If you have not been to Bavette's GO!  Bottom line: having the hotel/restaurant/show all in one place made it everything sooo easy. Then only if / when you feel like it stroll onto the strip. It was a civilized and pleasant trip to Vegas thanks to Park MGM!
50,The staff are friendly and professional. There is always someone around to answer any questions. The room was beautiful. The location is great. Anything you need is here at this hotel. If you don’t like gambling there is so much to do. There is all types of food within and around the hotel. The concierge can set up any type of activity you like. Traveling is what you make of it but It is an awesome time. Even the bathrooms are clean!!! And the most comfortable beds and pillows.
50,We recently spent a weekend at the Park MGM for my nieces 21st birthday. Her shades were not working so asked at the front desk if this could be fixed. Otherwise she would be unable to see her view from the room. I got in early to decorate the room and by the time I was finishing up they were right outside the door. I met Andres Ramirez and his partner who was in training and they were very nice and friendly. Andres explained what happened and why it wasn't working and had it fixed before my niece ever checked into her room. Great service call thank you Andres and partner.
30,The rooms are clean but nothing special. The location is great staff is friendly and the pool is nice. There isn't a frig in the room so if you are like me and want a cold drink in the morning before getting dressed that isn't possible. The walls are super thin I could actually hear other people talking using the bathroom etc.
50,My trip was fine casino was very good to us. Food in the Best Friends Betty Grill and Primrose was awesome! Drinks at the bar were good also. Great location on the strip and love the no smoking policy.
50,Annual trip to golf watch football and steak dinner. Park MGM did not disappoint. Checked all the boxes for location service cleanliness and variety of options for gambling & food. Also right outside the doors is a place called BeerHaus. Best place to drink eat and watch sports
40,Lady Gaga was Amazing! Food options were good- MLife Desk agents were super friendly and helpful- When I had an issuewith my card they reprinted them and came out to the floor to assist me. Price for room was reasonable when you factor in freeplay and resort credit- Casino floor was kept well maintained and a floor manager was always easy to find.
50,GREAT location on the strip. Walker friendly to lots of locations plus great shopping options across the street. Nice restaurants. Smoke-FREE hotel! Staff was accommodating. Rooms aren’t HUGE but they’re all you need and clean. Would stay again!
50,Everything went well. The room was clean. The service was quick and friendly. We were within walking distance to a lot of fun things. Hotel had access to some really nice things like Best Friend and Eataly.
50,I really like my stay at the park MGM. We use to stay there when it was Monte Carlo. It is much cleaner and it is smoke-free that is very nice. The colors are very nice. The staff is very friendly. And I really like to eat at Eataly before our hockey games.
50,Park MGM was fantastic. We rented a pool cabana on Friday and I Jessica has our house and she made that visit very enjoyable and was very hospitable to all of us. Everything about Park MGM was perfect for our trip and each person loved it thoroughly
50,It was our first time staying here. We were very impressed that there was no smoking throughout the property. The rooms were nice. The bed and pillows were very comfortable. The shower was just like getting a massage. Front desk was prompt with our request. We will definitely stay there again.
50,The Park MGM is a great location and very clean. The non-smoking property is very important to me and was an added bonus! The rooms are very clean and comfy. The theater is an incredible venue very intimate. Lady Gaga’s Jazz and piano performance was absolutely incredible! No better show in town!
10,I went to Vegas to watch football. I was really disappointed when I went to the sports book at Park MGM and could not sit a the bar in the Sports book to watch football and play video poker while I watched unless I paid a price to spend a certain amount of money at the sports book. The Vegas after Covid to get money of patrons just to sit and watch football is unacceptable. Patrons who bet on gambling at their casino who are Platinum at their establishment. I understand paying during Super bowl but regular football weekends this is crazy. It will make me choose to go to places in other states that a closer to my home to watch and bet on football. Not a place to go to watch football.
50,Needless to say that we've all had a tough year last year and part of 2021. Park MGM provides just the right relaxing and at the same time fun atmosphere. Unless one wants to wander out for extra entertainment Park has everything necessary for a great escape
50,I loved staying at The Park MGM. It is a smoke free hotel from top to bottom. The room was beautiful clean and very quiet. The food at the Primrose was excellent and the staff wonderful. They made a point of getting to know me and to make my stay comfortable.  The Front Desk staff was helpful and friendly. Overall an excellent choice when in Vegas.
40,We booked a trip for three nights and had a very nice time. The hotel was very convenient and the food was great. I really enjoyed all the options in Eataly. If you love Italian food this is the place to go for a quick convenient delicious meal! I loved the fact that the casino is smoke free! Also the tram to the Aria and Bellagio was great!
50,This is a very clean hotel. The rooms casino restaurants bathrooms and meeting rooms were all immaculate. Lots of yummy food to choose from in the hotel and lots to choose from right outside the hotel. There are plenty of bars and a tram is available to Aria and Bellagio.
40,lovely hotel and a pleasure to have no smoke in the casino  getting a coffee in the morning was difficult because there was long lines at Starbucks a small coffee cart was available on the weekends outside Primrose restaurant.
40,The park mgm provided a smoke free room friendly staff and a comfortable bed. Our room was not as clean as it could have been and needed some repair. One suggestion if you want coffee visit the Starbucks across the street in Target no line
40,We have been waiting for years for someone to have a non smoking property on the strip. We've encountered many travelers who had the same complaint who must be rejoicing at not having to be exposed to especially cigar smokers.
20,Staff pounded on our door at 4:30 a.m. for a minor payment issue and acted in a threatening manner. Staff could have simply called about the issue in the morning. Very dissatisfied - a poor example of taking care of long time customers. I'm hoping they resolve the issue.
50,The Park MGM room was a perfect choice for a Vegas stay! The room was unique as its red colored accent walls with different areas to enjoy for relaxing with music kicking up your feet to watch TV or lounging to road a book. The sleek furnishings and clean lines was icing on the cake.
40,For that reason alone I will recommend to friends and clients! I didn’t eat at any of the restaurants but great selections. And there’s a Starbucks on the first floor!!!! Great first time experience! Thanks Park MGM!
20,Stayed at a room facing the t mobile arena and heard music throughout the night sound of the other room’s shower sound of closing the window shades - felt like we slept right outside the casino. Paid $500+/night and felt completely ripped off. Would never stay here again. If we are watching another concert at the park theater aria is still walking distance.
20,"This room looks like it was last updated in the 80s or 90s. Gross tan carpet a safe that reads your credit card to lock it the bathtub had been refinished with paint at some point but that paint was chipping and flaking a mirrored cabinet as an armoire etc. The light fixtures arrear to have been wired in the 60s or 70s and there is a framed picture with jagged shattered glass hanging on the wall. I have no idea how they justify charging nearly $400 per night for this place I booked with Hyatt points and would have gotten a better cleaner room for half the points at the Hyatt Place. I honestly considered checking out and moving to another hotel this morning but we have a weeding to attend this afternoon.    We've traveled to several hotels in the past month and all of them have had distinct COVID protocols in place. Glasses were wrapped in plastic disposable plastic cups were also provided plastic baggies over the remotes and frequently touched surfaces at least a couple of packaged sanitizing wipes for your use etc. NONE of that at the Park MGM.    ParkMGM seems to be stuck in the 1980s for furnishings and could be the star of a 60 Minutes exposé on substandard hotel cleaning practices from 5 years ago.    One of the glasses in my room had used toothpaste foam in the bottom. I suspect the previous occupant had used it on the bathroom counter as a toothbrush holder then the maid just turned it upside down and put it on the tray with the ice bucket for the next user.    I complained and they sent a ""housekeeping manager"" up and she took the obviously dirty glass and said she would replace it. And I was like ""What about the other glass?"" and she picks it up and says ""It looks clean."" And I said ""I want two clean glasses."" She walks out of the room and walks right back in with two glasses holds them up to the light and said ""Are these clean enough for you?""    I was able to confirm this morning that the housekeeping carts do not carry trays of clean or sterilized glasses so their current cleaning procedure is apparently the maids (sometimes) look at the glasses and rinse them in the sink if they are visibly dirty and sometimes they just turn them upside down on the ice tray for the next guest.    The Housekeeping manager asked if there was anything else and I mentioned there were white crusty splatters on the velvet surface of the sofa and she looked at me blankly like ""what am I supposed to do about that?"" So we just decided to not use the sofa and asked her to leave."
50,We stayed here for a conference. Enjoyed all aspects--location spacious rooms easily navigable no smoking in the casino. But who would have thought a highlight of the trip would have been the Security staff most notably Hank G. When we found ourselves lost he came to the rescue proactively and walked us to our destination inside the hotel. He was extremely personable and you could tell he loved interacting with guests. We ended up asking him a bunch of questions and he took the time to engage and get us all the answers. Truly a gem of a guy and someone we will remember long after our trip. In a world where customer service is in decline it was great having an exceptional experience with someone who went out of their way to make us feel important. Thank you!!
50,We heard from an outside source about the Park MGM did it's cleaning and maintenance really well. That proved to be very accurate. The park gets 5 stars for being brave enough to be a smoke free hotel and casino. We've stayed in Vegas dozens of times and at different properties. The price to value rating at the Park was very low for us meaning we felt the room costs were very overpriced for what we received probably double the costs of what it should have been. So if you can get a room price great deal and value a non-smoking environment the Park MGM is a great choice.
40,we stayed here as this was the venue for the concert we were attending as well. we did early check-in (11am) and our room was available by 1030am. we were put in a room on the Nomad hotel side which was really nice! location to food and other hotels was convenient. service was great.
10,Pathetic rooms don't bring hanging clothes - no room to hang them. Horrible pillows. No coffee maker mini-fridge or microwave. You have to leave your room to get a cup of coffee or a cold drink of water. Had to hang multiple clothing items on each of the few hangers available. Staff couldn't care less.
50,Loved their service from the beginning to the end of my stay. Especially the housekeeping! I felt pampered 💜I forgot my toothbrush called front desk and sent someone immediately. The food court the location and casino that was smoke free. I had a very healthy stay 🙂
50,In for a broker conference mixed with family toward end of stay. Hotel was easy to navigate good food court & meeting/conf rooms & close to arena & nightlife. Will definitely keep this hotel in mind for the future.
10,I love MGM properties but I felt betrayed when they did this to my phone via their calendar invite. The front desk was not surprised by the “non-issue” since apparently you opt into that when you accept their calendar invite. Invasive and not worth the stay.
50,Beautiful modern yet artistic rooms. Gorgeous shower. Higher end accommodations with a great location. Concert hall in the building; great seats where ever you sit. Excellent handling for entrance into a concert for the handicapped very impressed with the expedited process to go through the ticket check in. Good variety of food. Excellent gelato. Clean environment.
50,What a pleasant surprise! We haven’t been to LV in almost a decade. Booked online and was so pleased with the results. First of all the hotel and casino are SMOKE FREE! That is such a breath of fresh air 🤣. It is very clean and well maintained. The staff is friendly. Their restaurant selection is great too with Eataly being a gem!!
50,The Park MGM was very good from the first day we arrived all the way until we checked out. The from desk was fast and even helped us check in early and the fact that there was a Bell desk service was awesome that way we did not have to carry luggage around while our room was being prepared. There was places at the hotel we was able to eat was so good also. the whole experience was the best.
30,The Park MGM is a good hotel/casino for the novice Vegas visitor. It has everything you'd need for a first timer. The rooms were clean and well appointed although no refrigerator or coffee-maker which would have been convenient. I don't even think we had a clock in the room but that's Vegas for you. Our room was on the 7th floor at the furthest end from the elevator which was a quite a hike and annoying after a couple of days for two people pushing 60. Our room faced the T-Mobile Arena Jumbotron which at nighttime made our window seem like a big screen TV. I highly recommend facing the strip. The staff was friendly and helpful when needed. The restaurants seemed okay and the display of food at Eataly looked good but we didn't try any of it. The casino wasn't particularly inviting and I found it difficult to find a 25 cent slot machine so we went elsewhere (really liked Orleans Casino). Parking was easy enough but quite a walk. My biggest gripe is the resort fee which really jacks up the cost but they all do it. Most importantly we had a great time in Vegas and the hotel was fine. Would I stay there again probably not but there is plenty to do or see around the Park MGM.
40,Good location; easy self-checkin. Rooms did not have refrigerator (would like to be able to keep cold beverages on hand!) and our digital access keys (using our phones) failed consistently. Not a big deal as we just printed physical keys. Our 3rd time at this property and we may be back (but we’ll look for rooms at other properties with refrigerators first!).
40,No smoking was a bonus for us!!!  Casino staff was friendly and helpful.  The housekeeping staff was awesome!!  Room was cleaned every time we returned. Don’t like the masking indoors. Made communication very difficult.
10,Rooms were not clean super loud (partying in adjacent rooms every night) no coffee no coffee maker microwave refrigerator in rooms. Internet was HORRIBLE! Self parking was paid for but we had trouble getting out of the garage every single time and the person who was supposed to help was rude and uncooperative. Super long lines for coffee no restaurants open when needed. We will never go back.
50,Rooms are brand new Eataly + Best Friend are absolute top notch restaurants and I LOVED the entire hotel was non-smoking. Check in is easy check out is a breeze. The location is near the Aria + Cosmo which is lovely. All in all 10/10
50,Love the Amenities overall and the food choices. Also non- smoking was a big plus. Beds were very comfy. Staff was friendly and helpful with needs. Highly recommend!!! Great location on the strip also.
50,We LOVED our time at the Park. I was surprised when we walked in at how good it smelled. The rooms are beautifully decorated. The food court Eataly is a lot of fun and has so many options. We loved the shuttle to the Bellagio. The pools were beautiful and well maintained. All the staff was very friendly. We felt right at home and hope to return soon.  Thank you!
50,Everything you need from a nice hotel is here at the Park MGM. Great selection of bars and different types of food. Pool area is spectacular!! I most likely will book this hotel again next summer or fall.
20,Rooms are not quiet...you can hear guests in the hallway and next door. Also can hear the loud music coming from the street all night. Location was good but check-in was sloppy. (gave us keys but a wrong room number).
50,Everything great if I was going to change anything.. update rooms. But showers were great didn’t want to get out wish there was a bathtub 🛀 too. Love no smoking. Easy to Aria.. n trams to middle of Vegas
50,The conference set up was perfect. The Park MGM is easy to get around in since it isn’t enormous. The pools were nice and clean. Only downside was how cold it was inside the building especially when it was not hot outside.
10,Old over priced rooms not worth it go somewhere else. Small casino not any food choices room was very old and worn it not worth it at half the price.    Durning hockey game impossible to navigate or get taxi or use u Uber due traffic reroute
30,Nice hotel no smoking is a plus for children and sensitive noses. Steak house was incredible. Sports book restaurant was over priced for the selection and service for the food was good once we figured out they weren't serving us until we sat in a certain section.
30,My husband and I generally love this casino which is why we wanted to try a stay here. However it was very noisy between rooms. We could hear everything even when the neighbors pulled up their blinds. Cool rooms and glad we got to try it out but probably won't stay there again. We will continue to frequent the casino dining and other amenities it offers.
20,I went on a business trip to Vegas. My room cost about $50 and the resort fee was about the same price for one night. I couldn't find any open restaurants that night. Room service was closed not great
50,This is a gem. Rooms small but nicely updated with remodel and new furnishings. Space well conserved. I will definitely stay here again. Unless a better deal comes along. I hope MGM exces will consider other stores for no smoking. We are now the majority
40,I understand the Vegas milieu but personally I would appreciate a coffee pot in the room for that morning pick me up as opposed to having to walk the long way to the elevator and stand in line at Starbucks for $1 cup of coffee that costs $5+.
50,The smoke free environment friendly staff convenient parking and generous slot machines make this the best hotel!! Convenient location too!    The tram and bridges makes it easy to visit other hotels and venues.
50,We had the most helpful person named Andres Ramirez from the Engineering Dept. My husband needed a refrigerator for his medicine and changed our light bulb and also our air filter. We will stay again.
10,The lines for the check in was so crowded  there is no differentiation in helping guests who are already staying with park mgm and who are waiting to check in … it was such a worst situation  I had to wait more than 30 mins to get a response to a simple question is late check out . The person at the front desk made me go back to the line and come again  and was so rude … there is no customer service at all I will not stay with park mgm again and out friends who came with us also had similar experience  we were a party of 16 people  we asked for rooms together in the same floor  they only gave same floor for 10 people and then since we checked in late said we can’t give the room on the same floor . Also the security near the pool entrance was soo rude … he was treating us so badly in front of the kids .. we will definitely not recommend or stay with park mgm again … we made a wrong choice.
50,We booked a room at the Luxor but were bothered by the excess cigarette smoke. Could not have made a better decision to switch to Park MGM! Only smoke free casino/hotel in Vegas with excellent staff and amazing restaurants.
50,Love the location on the strip. Great courteous accommodating staff. Loved the Spa great couples massage. Lots of delicious food choices from sit down dining to to go options. Suites are clean comfortable and we had daily maid service.
50,I love the non-smoking environment and hotel smells good as soon as you walk in. Location is really good and they have EATALY! The only problem I encountered was the online check-in didn’t work. So we had to line up to check in.
10,Rooms are filthy house keeping is incompetent and cannot do anything right. Front desk people are useless and could not help with any issues they just tried to pass them off. Pay the extra money and go elsewhere or go to a cheaper place and save your money.
50,PMGM is super clean. Their staff is awesome and the best part I can check in and out from my own phone. I didn’t need a key for my room since it’s already in your application. I would definitely recommend PMGM
40,The beds in our room were not comfortable at all. In fact the worst bed I've slept in. And I've stayed in a lot of hotels in my day. We loved the smoke free environment. The staff were all very nice and helpful. .
40,The On line check in is good however be sure to check your room location before doing so. Got a room on 4th floor overlooking roof with terrible view. Fortunately we were able to change our room with little hassle but could have been a real problem if they were busy that week.
50,I loved staying at the MGM properties easy to talk to Receptionists the room was neat and clean. The center point on the strip hotel where you are close to everything shopping restaurants shows. Its like our 2nd home away from home.
50,M-life comp room and smoke free facility made for an awesome stay. Easy access to everything on the strip. Great restaurants and bars. Nice variety of casino gaming options. Clean facilities and friendly staff.
40,Perfect for walking the strip to other nearby resorts. Nice theater in Casino. Easy walk from parking to room elevators. Very helpful staff at check-in VIP counter Bell Hop & Concierge desks. Room okay beds were a bit worn/sagging. Bad service/food at La Pizza & le Pasta in the Eataly food court. in-out parking $15.00 on top of room/resort fees. Very clean rooms great housekeeping.
20,Rooms are dirty. Hotel charge $39. Resort fee per day. They don’t even have free water of water per day. There is no refrigerator in the room. Also do not have coffee pot in the room. So you can’t even make a cup of coffee in the morning.
50,Great place to celebrate Birthdays. Flew in on Thursday and back to work on Monday. West coast to East coast... Eatly is a great place to hang out with the Family for food . Just need more servers for coffee in the Morning.
40,The Park MGM is located in the middle of everything which is nice but surprisingly it is hard to find food at the Park itself. There are only Italian options to eat and everything closes at like ten. So if you want to get a midnight snack you are out of luck on site. You have to run toward New York New York or cross the street to Denny's. It was just not something I was expecting on the Stripe in Las Vegas.
50,We enjoyed several wonderful days at the smoke free Park MGM hotel and resort. The restaurants casino pool and spa provided excellent opportunities for a relaxing enjoyable vacation. This hotel will definitely be our first choice when we return to Las Vegas.
20,If you are staying via MyVegas rewards you are better off staying at Mandalay or Bellagio. The casino is beautiful but I am thinking that the hotel is still from the Monte Carlo days. Skip. Stains on carpet old dark hallways etc. Smallest bathroom I have seen in Vegas.
40,The location was good and service was excellent. Checking in was very easy and staff are friendly. The tram ride to other casinos was very useful. .it allowed us to take the tram and explore parts of the strip that required walking. We had breakfast at primrose. The omelet was below standard and felt like it was done earlier and was cold. The Italian Cafe was excellent.    Overall we had a good experience
40,Had been meaning to try this location due to the non-smoking you offer and it was worth the stay. Although the rooms do need to be properly cleaned for next visitors. Would definitely recommend this hotel to friends and family.
10,Had to move 3 times for a 2 night stay. 2nd room had strands of hair on the shower curtain & toilet had stains. 3rd room bathroom door didn't have a handle. As a first time guest it was unpleasant. Imagine having to move from one floor to the another during the first two days. The room I was finally expecting to get I only enjoyed for like less than 24 hours. To pay the room rate in full plus the expensive resort fees for such an experience was not fair.
40,Great air quality. Nice restroom. Beautiful Mirror. Relaxing Shower. Cons: Found dirty socks behind sofa. Mattress made of concrete. Pillows filled with polyester synthetic fibers. Room was a warm 72∘
50,Park MGM is a perfect spot to stay in Vegas! Great gambling facility and sportsbook!!! The location has everything to offer and plenty of stuff to do as always!!!!!    Stay at Park MGM and you will have access to many entertainment spots nearby. I love that area and it has everything to offer. My thing is the sportsbook and it has many eateries around it!!!!!!!
50,This hotel is located right near everything. The room was very çlean. I liked the self early check in and out it left time to just enjoy our stay without having to deal with anyone. The one thing I didn't love was the phone key pass as sometimes it didn't work but I was easily able to get a key.
40,First time staying at this property. Nice location NON SMOKING!! You don't realize just how much you appreciate that until you enter some of the other properties on the strip and get smothered by smoke. Room was comfortable fashionable and well appointed. Resort fee sucks but we all know and agree about that. Vegas is the only place where hotel internet isn't free.
50,We loved Eataly what a gem ... authentic Italian foods and loved the atmosphere in there. Location of hotel is spot on and is very well kept. Rooms were redone and very spacious. We also enjoyed the bench under window and all the outlets in the room!
10,Visited with company conference. We were located at Park MGM. Rooms are really not up to par. No storage. Just an dated but updated property with poor room designs!! Very little storage. Also had entire morning with no hot water. No apologies or explanation. Just our tough luck I guess.
50,This was my first time staying at Park MGM. Room decor is lovely room and bathroom are spacious water pressure in the shower is great beds are comfortable and you can’t beat the location. Staff is friendly. Special call out to Brewster in Security. He struck up a conversation with us in the wine bar at Eataly. He was very knowledgeable about the restaurants and other property amenities and was such a joy to chat with. If I had one complaint it is with the tv. When powering on if you don’t hit the right buttons fast enough it goes to a black screen saying it’s ready for Bluetooth connection and no buttons pushed will get you back to the menu to access the tv channels. The only option is to power off and back on. In summary we really enjoy this hotel and would stay here again.
50,Wonderful non smoking hotel convenient location Starbucks on site.  Restaurants were tasty! Mobile check in/check out very convenient.  Nice to have daily housekeeping. Would be nice to have a mini Frig for cold water.
50,Beautiful property! Best sleep in a comfy bed. Lala noodles was busy but customer service was great did was delicious! Sports book bar was busy and had big screen playing baseball and football! Fun ambiance!
40,Good room no fridge and that bummed us out. 35$ To rent a fridge which was crazy. Walls were very thin could hear our neighbors getting it on. Bed comfy room clean view good would stay here again
50,The location is unbeatable and the staff is fantastic. The rooms are simple yet very clean and they're pretty spacious. We always like coming here because it's a quick walk to many other properties with Mlife.
40,For any request you have to make multiple times before you get an answer. Request to switch from a king to double/queen beds with Hyatt customer rep turn me down. Called the hotel 2-3 days to make that requests. Turned me down. Both said to check in earlier and make that requests. So I did and guess what turn me down at check in. Only until I spoke with the manager that’s when he try to help. Request eventually granted but after 3 attempts and not willing to help staffs. Staff may have suffer from post pandemic syndrome.
50,Traveled for vacation with my friend from California. I loved that I was able to check in right away (early check in) as soon as I landed. The room was clean and the housekeeping staff was accommodating.
10,The mobile key didn't work on the elevator  Had to stand in check in line no VIP services open for Platinum members  Had to wait for someone going up to the 13th floor Room was smelly like POT  Lots of pot being smoked in the room the cappuccinos in the AM ordered were cold and no flavor rooms were Janky broken mini bar none available People on one side were smoking pot all night people on the other side having sex all night I had my Son with me Paper thin walls can hear clear conversations about drugs I'll Never stay there again !
10,I wrote this too many times before. Please refer to my other comments. I am a platinum member but the service I received was terrible. I was invited for this trip but was hugely disappointed by the services or lack thereof.
50,We stayed at Park MGM Las Vegas for a business convention. The facilities for our meetings were great. The food provided for the attendees was fantastic! And there were lots of shows food and other things to do in the area when not at our meetings.
50,Convenience in the event accessible to other MGM because of tram shopping dining.  Love that parking is near lobby then elevatorsI don’t have to walk far  Very accessible to ride share and easy to follow direction/guides
50,Non-smoking was a huge plus. Rooms are spacious and nice. Only needs a mini fridge. Will stay here again. Like the close proximity to MGM Grand NYNY and Aria. Very clean hotel. Wish the pool area stayed open past 6pm. But bottom line very nice stay.
50,The place is very clean. The non smoking is amazing the only casino/hotel with nonsmoking. Made a huge difference in my stay. The staff gave really great service. The place is easy to navigate. I will be back
50,My buddies and I stayed at the park mgm for a night and went and watched the golf tournament the next morning. For a busy street like the strip the park is easy to get in and out of. Great location. Clean hotel. Would recommend this property to anyone.
10,not worth the money very small room and dirty hallway room was vey basic not a 4 star hotel at all. called for stuff but takes forever. Service was decent had to pay for parking. great location though
50,The casino is non-smoking which is the top reason I stay there. Their Eataly Italian market Experience is also amazing with an extensive variety of Italian fare. All restaurants in the Park that I have visited have unique dishes to please most taste-buds. The only disappointment is that there is nowhere to get food late night/early morning.
50,We visited Eataly and were checking out their impressive wine collection when Hank struck up a conversation with us. He was extremely knowledgeable with the wines as he has been studying them after work (Hank is a security guard). Hank told us about the Happy Hour deal of 3 wines for $10 between 3-5 everyday which we happily took advantage of. He then gave us a discount at any restaurant at the PArk MGM which we happily used. Thanks Hank you made our trip!
10,The whole hotel felt cramped. The lobby has dropped ceilings which over emphasize how cramped it can feel when it is crowded. Beds were terribly uncomfortable. The hallways to your rooms were dim and never cleaned. They always had garbage on the floor even with the house keeping cleaning the rooms. I never Saw them vacuuming the hall ways. Eataly was a joke food was subpar for the prices. The steak restaurant Bavette’s was totally snobby. Told us didn’t have a table until 8pm but bar was open went to bar it was full and they had 30+ tables open. Pools are mostly covered by other buildings so you have to fight to get a chair in the sun and they play crappy loud sexually explicit songs. Staff was not overly kind nor happy to see you. The room door to bathroom and closet was annoying. Storage for clothes was almost non existent and only 5 hangers.  Trying to call front desk almost took a technology degree. They lock in elevator was frustrating. If you missed it once it started you had to ride all the way down.  Rooms are not quiet you can hear everyone.  Compared to other hotels/casinos Park MGM is subpar.
20,Facility updating has failed to address the lack of insulating between rooms. That combined with the large student vacation event was a nasty combination.  Location is a positive; however not enough to make up for the poorly insulated rooms.  Small negatives: no fridges in rooms no coffee makers in rooms (very long coffee lineups at the casino level every morning)
50,Park MGM has been renovated from the old Monte Carlo with nice places to eat. nice loud hip music nice pool areas. A definitely place to visit that is central to the Vegas Strip. I like the Tram to take you to other Casinos in the strip.  Edison
20,For the cost the carpets were filthy in the rooms and in the hallways. This property was better when it was Monte Carlo. I don’t know why MGM properties in Vegas are beginning to feel run down. Pick up the slack
50,Dealers at the craps table are wonderful. They made my experience really nice. I love this non-smoking hotel. Staff is helpful and the 3 pools are really nice. Most chairs around the pool are free which is nice. Plenty of great places to eat.
30,Our daughter was coming to Las Vegas to get married and arranged with Park MGM to reserve a number of rooms for everyone to stay at. When arriving on Wednesday night we had very limited choices to grab a bite to eat as the Cafe closes at 2 pm LaLa Noodle was closed so you only had the Steakhouse very expensive the Eatery or the Grill with just a few fast food items. When we went upstairs the floors were very dark and dreary. The rooms weren't bad but no coffee makers and there was loud music playing outside the hotel all night long. If you are a somewhat light sleeper it would probably keep you up. Upon arriving with my 92 year old mom we asked the Bell desk to borrow or rent a wheelchair and they told me the company they rent from was out. They made no effort to contact other companies to arrange one. I Googled companies and found one on my own. The Monte Carlo was a beautiful hotel/casino and MGM has ruined it.
50,Two things stood out regarding this facility….it was smoke-free and Eataly the HUGE restaurant(s) portion of the hotel. We felt like we were walking the streets of Rome and eating our way thru the city. Every kind of Italian cuisine you could hope forL
40,My husband and I enjoy the feel of the park. As non smokers it's a literal breath of fresh air. Eataly is gorgeous and a unique addition to the strip. This was not our first visit to the park and we will be back.
40,A truly great experience from the very first minute you can feel the difference. I believe all the times we been to Las Vegas this is the best Hotel and Casino staff. The only issue was the rooms are very small but clean and quiet. The favorite part of the property is the bo smoking policy (what a difference). Even though the small rooms would go again. A great place to eat is the Primrose Restaurant we ate there every day. The food was excellent and staff super especially the Manager Bridget I wish every restaurant had a Manager like that. Me and my wife also enjoyed gambling there. No smoke and a great vibe.
20,Due to the extra fees I had to pay for the room my guest was upset that I had no money to participate in a trip because I had spent over a 1000 for a room. We asked for a room that was a little better cleaned and when go there there was a couple arguing
50,Jack Gamboa from the security department was kind and helpful to my friend and I. He escorted us around the hotel to our destination rather than simply giving us directions. He ensured our safety was his #1 priority and was courteous in going so. Thanks Jack and Park MGM!!!
50,Silvestre Cabrera the engineer was great! Showed up almost immediately after calling we had a problem ~ the front desk said it would be a priority and it was! He was very nice and personable and resolved the issue efficiently and quickly. Thank you!
30,The amenities were sub oar in the room. One of each toiletry one towel set no coffee supplies no alarm clock.  *We were awoken by loud construction noise in the adjoining room. Sounded like someone was cutting into the wall along with other various construction noises.  *It appeared that our room was located in the middle of a block of very loud guests that were banging loudly on surrounding doors and yelling in the hallway late at night into early morning hours. The party finally settled in the room next door and went on until 3am.  *We asked for our room to be serviced one day that we planned to be out touring. When we returned we found our room untouched. We had to ask the maid the next morning for some towels and were told they were short on towels and no washcloths. Disappointing...  * The blinds are extremely loud when neighboring rooms are opening or closing them. It sounds as if it is happening in our room.
40,They Trip was very enjoyable. Checking in was the easiest thing I've ever done the front desk staff are very hospitable and helpful no matter the time of day or night. The Cleaning staff were very accommodating.
30,don't bother with the slots -- worst in vegas. this place is great if you want to be in a crowd of drunk kids not so much if you want to be able to have a relaxing time and grab things like food & coffe & drinks without confronting a hassle each time. the demon horde not withstanding if you want to be able to get simple things like coffee & a bottle of sparkling of water after sleeping in -- you just pretty much can't without a half an hour in line at starbucks or primrose or a 20 minute hike to the other side of the casino (or to the next casino over Aria where they do a much better job at basic service). the nighthawk suites are big and comfy but pretty no-frills. why mgm can't bother to install a coffee pot or a mini fridge standard is beyond me.
20,Nomad Library and The Eatly were amazing but did not make up for the small rooms. It was nice to have a smoke free casino. Most disappointed that I left an item in the safe followed hotel procedure for lost and found but zero response or acknowledgment. Poor customer service!
40,Only suggestions would be to provide coffeemakers in the room and maybe one bottle of water  They also really need a traditional coffee shop to enjoy a moderately priced breakfast. They have a restaurant for breakfast but it is way overpriced and seating is very limited.
30,From October 8 till October 9 I Stayed & Watched Tyson furry vs Wilder fight.. best fight ever.. while checking out Left my DJI OM 4 in the room… Lost n found not responding.. Thank u for any help……….
50,Clean and very modern hotel room. The view in our room was very nice. I hope you could loosen up the slot machines. Please add more keno and poker machines. Very accessible to everywhere and good walks to everywhere.
50,Loved our two stays there will stay there again. I’ve referred a couple friends to the Park MGM & they also loved the hotel and the great location. Service & amenities were top notch and the staff was very kind
20,It’s still the old Monte Carlo infrastructure so don’t expect much. Was in an adjoining room and neighbor was noisy from 3:30am-6am trying to open our door playing music etc. Tried to switch/upgrade rooms before that and was denied tried after and was offered a room w/2 queens (wanted king) and an upgrade fee. Abandoned my free rooms (casino offer) and went to the Encore instead.    Blackjack on the floor is garbage 6:5 aside from maybe 1-2 tables.
10,Ive stayed in Vegas several times and this was by far the worst. Room was dirty food was horrible. I lost my phone and security never met me to show me the phone they had. Hard to get anyone for any kind of service.I could go on but not gonna waste my time.
50,We had a fantastic weekend trip at this hotel! It was absolutely perfect the room was so clean and trendy Eataly was delicious and the spa was magical. We felt like we had 8 trips packed into one weekend with all we were able to do at this hotel. Thank you for a perfect getaway!
30,"minimum hours at lobby restaurant (Primrose 6am-2pm) and limited lobby bar hours was really odd. Sometimes dont' want to trek through entire casino to find something little to eat.    Gift shop is super lacking ""everyday"" clothing    Room were nice but no coffee maker or fridge was different to me    Staff is EXTREMELY dedicated to making everything right!    Good location on strip I was a first timer to Vegas and it really was great."
30,had a fun stay there love the self park easy access. Casino not so big and the rooms are ok. The main issue I had was trying to get some sleep while they are hosting sporting events next door at the T mobile center which was super loud!
50,We really enjoyed our stay at Park MGM! It's in a good location on the strip and the tram to the Aria and Bellagio was convenient. Our room was spacious and clean and we liked the decor. Would have been nice to have a mini fridge but that's the only complaint we had and it wasn't really a big deal overall. Will definitely stay again next time we are in Vegas!
50,Park MGM was clean quiet and comfortable. Located in the heart of the action. Next to T-Mobil. Reasonably-priced restaurants and food venues close by. Staff at Park MGM were friendly and helpful. We will be back
20,The room was dated didn’t appear to well cleaned a used mask from previous guest left in the room. We had a room with an adjoining room and you hear clearly every conversation in the attached room. There was no coffee pot in the room and the room was pricey with fees and tax over $500.00! Totally not worth it.
40,Our 2 queen room was comfortable and clean. We had a view of T-mobile arena as well as New York New York and Excalibur. Really enjoyed the non smoking casino. Machines were really tight. I got a comp room and probably would not pay to stay there again. It was comfortable but nothing really stands out about it
10,The hotel facility over-all is ok but the building is old and there is NO soundproofing or insulation in the walls; the are PAPER THIN. You can here EVERYTHING next door and across the hall.  We were surrounded by College kids partying all night and could not sleep all weekend.
40,We have been coming to this property for years (remember The Monte Carlo?). Love the location on the strip. Good selection of restaurants and the gaming area is always changing. The only thing I would like is an early morning coffee spot.
50,We stayed at the Park MGM for the first time. We really enjoyed the hotel and were really surprised that the hotel and the casino were smokeless. It was really noticeable and really awesome. The pool area was really nice. We normally stay at the Delano. We liked the location of Park MGM.
50,I travelled to Vegas for a few days on short notice with the intent of spending all my time in S.UT and N.AZ areas. The weath had other plans so I stayed at the MGM Park instead and it was a great experience. It was clean totally non-smoking very convenient to most attractions the hotel feels airy and bright. I did notice that there is a lot of traffic and it gets busy while trying to park when the TMobile theater has an even or the Raiders are playing but that happens at other hotels when there are events. Its very convenient to get in and out of parking otherwise and you can avoid driving on the strip altogether.
20,"I made my reservation through an American Express program which charged me a certain amount for my stay and included a $100 voucher towards participating food/spa services at Park MGM. I payed for most of it online and had a set balance to pay at the hotel. However when I arrived at the hotel the front desk insisted that I had a larger balance than what Amex was quoting me. However they were not able to provide me an explanation for what that additional charge consisted of because their ""system"" wasn't showing an itemized list of the charges. It blows my mind that a grand hotel such as Park MGM was not able to explain my bill to me. They advised that I call Amex to sort out the issue. I then spent the next 2 hours on the phone with Amex who advised me that the charges at Park MGM were not accurate. It turns out that Amex was right as when I eventually checked out of the hotel Park MGM did not charge me the additional balance. So the 2 hours I spent on the phone with Amex trying to sort out the issue during my first evening there was all for nothing. Not only did I waste my time trying to understand nonexistent fees but after my stay Amex informed me that Park MGM was supposed to provide me with a welcome package at the front desk explaining how to use my dining/spa credit. This was never provided to me at check-in and I therefore did not know the correct protocol to use my $100 credit. Because of that I did not receive the credit.  In conclusion my short stay at Vegas was made even shorter more frustrating and less rewarding all thanks to the poorly trained staff at Park MGM."
50,Thanks Nice hotel with convenient location and non smoking casino! Staff were friendly and hotel rooms are very clean and comfortable! Restaurants and shops in the plaza are very nice and location to the hockey arena is excellent.
40,Resort is very clean and best of all smoke free! The staff is friendly and helpful. The food was good and the pools are very clean and enough of them to not be overly crowded. Our room with a connecting room was noisy.
40,"Excellent vacation style room. Access to an ice machine is priceless during 100+ degree days!    The closet was very small - this is only a complaint for business travelers. You would be hard pressed to keep your clothes from wrinkling.    Casino is ""just ok"". It does not have the ambiance of a NYNY theme area but being smoke free is also priceless!"
40,I like to stay in Park MGM because of none smoking hotel. Not only none smoking hotel but the Park MGM is right into the trip and it is very convenient. The room is very nice I like the bathrooms. It has been remodeled and it is very big and clean.
50,Beautiful hotel and the non smoking casino was perfect the paigow dealers were very friendly and personable the only bad thing was there was only one paigow table open my whole stay the second table was closed
50,We recently stayed for a week and was amazed at this property! Such a convenient location so close to our favorite restaurants & stores. Don’t forget about Eataly! Probably the single biggest reason we chose to stay here TWICE in one year! Rooms are spacious for 2 ppl and the bed was so comfortable. There was no fridge in the room but we called to ask for one and it was brought up immediately.
50,The PARK was great. Excellent amenities. Friendly and helpful staff. Great pool with efficient and friendly wait staff nice clean rooms convenient location and solid tables. I will revisit on my next trip to Vegas.
50,went for my dads birthday and to see mulaney we had a fantastic time and the room was very handicap accessible everything we needed was there and it was not to far from all the fun going on on the strip
40,We loved our stay at the ParkMGM Hotel. Having an array of restaurants to eat inside the hotel is a plus. Specially Eataly. The station to the Tram that goes all the way to the Bellagio is another plus.  Enforcing wearing a mask in common areas give a sense of security but being a smoke free facility was the best.  The staff is very courteous and friendly. Highly recommend this place to stay in Las Vegas.
50,An absolutely beautiful hotel in the heart of everything. The remodeling of this hotel was just beautiful. The lobby the rooms the pools were just outstanding. The park theatre and T mobile Arena right there is too much. An epic place.
20,The cable was out I had to pay $15 a day for parking and the room was filthy. Hand and lip prints on the windows. Condensation from the last guest in the ice bucket. There was also blood spots in the toilet from a prior guest. This was on the 28th floor in which I had paid an extra $75 a night to upgrade....Nah
40,Good location close to eateries and the larger casino-hotels. The rooms were comfortable but the bed was a little hard. Staff was friendly and the hotel and casino was clean.  Casino is a non smoking casino which was very nice!
20,The hotel rooms/hallway could use another re-model. Carpets were bot in best of shape and not very clean. Stained. Security needs to step their game up when patrons in rooms are loud and noisy at night
20,Super creepy hallways American Horror Story Hotel vibes. Blood red walls in my room. Zero room technology. Not sure how this was considered a 4 star hotel. Also all the carpets look very dirty. The veils are low at 6 feet tall I was almost touching the ceiling when exiting the elevator
10,This past weekend (Oct 9th-Oct 12th) I stayed at Park MGM. I come to Vegas about 3x a year solely for pleasure and usually stay at the Aria* MGM Grand or Venetian. This time around we decided to try out the new Park MGM as it was also rated a 4-star hotel.    I am extremely disappointed. Upon arrival there was a large pile of vomit outside our door (floor 4 room 305). We immediately reported this (not once but TWICE) and it was not until 48 hours later that it was cleaned up. Disgusting.    Additionally I am in disbelief that this is considered to be a 4-star hotel when there was not even a coffee maker in the room at a minimum. The wifi was down on Monday of our stay. There was black hair IN our bedsheets. The classic breakfast (for one person) and coffee totaled to be $70. The bathroom sink was stained with a brown ring around it. Maids did not come on Monday to clean my room.    I have stayed in 3-star hotels for work travel and had a better experience than this. I have never been disappointed with MGM but I am sincerely in disbelief of what an AWFUL experience this was.
50,Breathing while masking is taxing enough on the respiratory system but you add a smoky environment it can be very taxing. A non-smoking property is refreshing. This option in Las Vegas is ground-breaking thank you MGM!
30,The rooms are pretty useless if you like to store your clothes in a dresser or on a hanger. The bed is pretty comfortable. The casino is subpar. The table games are very limited and hard to find a seat.
40,We loved staying at Park MGM. The room was very simple when it came to amenities but perfect for Vegas! We loved that it was close to the end of the strip and only 10 minutes from the airport. The casino was also amazing an smoke free!
50,Great Location. Love the non smoking hotel and casino. It is great if you visit Las Vegas with your kids. The fact that it is non smoking made a huge difference. We went to my brother's casino and forgot how unpleasant it is when a small number of people smoke and make the casino smell awful.  We will definitely come back to Park MGM and gamble here!
50,First time staying at Park MGM. Staff is friendly and helpful Room was large. Great location if going to Allegiant Stadium. Casino staff is friendly although table game prices are a bit high after Covid. The facility is non-smoking Highly recommend staying there.
50,Excellent accommodations and the walkway to cross Las Vegas Blvd is right outside the entrance. If you’ve never been to Vegas this is great because you don’t have to walk far to cross to the other side of the street
50,A few restaurants couple of bars and a small casino. You’re in the middle of everything without all the hustle and bustle. Nice to have a bit of calm without losing all the amenities. Overall a really nice place to stay.
30,Bathroom Door wouldn't shut right and was terrible because we were sharing the room. Beds too low and very uncomfortable. Valet prices are ridiculous plus they want a tip on top of it. Bellhop Melvin was amazing very friendly and professional. He seems too be very over worked though.
50,The whole facility is very clean. It is a non-smoking facility. Literally in the middle of everything going on in Vegas. It feels like you are in some European town. The staff was very helpful. The only thing i would complain about is paying for parking. Its seems though all of Vegas is starting to do this now.
50,The rooms were very nice and clean staff is very friendly. Great restaurants in hotel. Everything was in walking distance from the hotel mall stores. Taco and Uber service were easy to obtain even with a boxing event happening right across the street at the T-Mobile arena.
20,Wifi was terrible w/ no cell service. Also lost & found never called us back even just to acknowledge that they got our message. We also left an email for them. We even went down to bell desk to ask about lost & found and they gave us the same convoluted procedure. Very very terrible.    It's one of those places where if nothing goes wrong it's great but hte moment something does that's when you really see the true quality.
40,My stay at ParkMGM was a fine experience. I was there midweek. Cost was low relative to the strip but even still the rooms were beds only. No other great amenities. Shower was crazy hard pressure air conditioner system didn’t work and not even cups in the room. And it wasn’t just mine my buddy’s room 3 floors down all the same.
10,Room has zero amenities. No fridge no coffee maker nothing! Walls are paper thin can hear my neighbors conversations crystal clear. No room service after 6?!?! Feels like a prison    Prefer a motel 6 over this garbage
20,If you want to be in this property stay at the nomad upstairs if the price isn't too high. Our room had broken things and stained sheets which weren't replaced when we asked. The room is super basic and you can hear any noise from the rooms next dear.
40,The ParkMGM is ok as long as you know what you're getting into. No fridge no coffee maker no microwave. I ended up using a cardboard box and a garbage bag filled with ice to keep some water cold.
30,We needed one night in Vegas and wanted to try the Eataly Italian experience which adjoins the Park lobby. Our room was tired the bed was uncomfortable and Eataly was disappointing. It was pure Vegas: all flash and loud music with mediocre expensive food. Nothing like the real Eataly I experienced in Milan.
50,I loved my stay at Park Mgm! I would book again for sure. The rooms were nice and I loved the decor. The walls are pretty thin so it’s easy to hear people from the next room or even in the hallway. The casino was great as well as the food options.
40,My husband and I attended Vegas for the first time and we were so happy with our experience at Park MGM. Everyone was friendly and the facility was nice and clean. The location on the strip was excellent as well!
50,I really love staying here all the time just wish I could afford it all the time but so far the Park is the best place to stay - close to everything and staff are always so welcoming - rooms are great and parking is the best!
10,Room was dirty with shoe prints on shower floor and bloom stains on bathroom flower. I was told I could not change rooms and that I should not have used the mobile app to check in. Then why did the hotel keep send me emails about checking in on the app!
20,I want to like the Park MGM but ultimately we felt unsafe and this prompted us to cut short our stay.    While the hotel has rules on masks and other safety precautions these are not enforced at all. Almost no one wore a mask at the gym which is unmonitored. By comparison everyone at the gym at the Bellagio wore a mask.    There as a Bruno Mars concert on the night of our stay. More than 80% of the guests walked right through the casino without a mask with the staff waving them through.    You get the impression the hotel didn't care about the rules which is deeply disappointing. I recommend you stay at one of the hotels that prioritizes safety.    Won't be coming back until pandemic is over.
10,Rooms were hot during the night. The dry cleaning service lost pants to a suit and stained the suit shirt we sent in the get dry cleaned. The girl at the desk help thought it was funny that the pants to the suit got lost and kept making jokes about it. We needed the suit to get married in the next day.
50,Love the Park MGM. Smoke Free Casino. Awesome dining options including Eataly. The NoMad Library's table side tuna tartare was the BOMB!!! 3 pools. Love the Stay Well Option. Location and service is also great. Will be going back in December 2021!
50,Great location. Clean doesn’t smell like third hand smoke . Very friendly staff. Because it’s the only smoke free casino it’s the only place I’ll stay . I’m don’t love the red color walls for sleeping however it was still nice. Smoke free = cleaner everything
30,The room was ok but we where not too close to the elevator but we could hear chatter of guest getting off elevators so while trying to go to sleep you heard a lot of chatter from guest getting off elevator and walking bye or congruating in corridors not very well insulated
40,This was my second stay here. I was turned off by the nosiness both at night and then in the early evening on Sat. Around 5:30 from a loudspeaker nearby for an event. Rooms are noisy but also could hear noise from hallways and adjacent rooms. Need better soundproofing so that customers can get rest when they need it. Too many people walking around unmasked and I never saw anyone enforce the mask policy.
50,I really enjoyed my stay here at Park MGM I wish every casino was smoke free like this one. This is my new favorite place to stay and to gamble in Las Vegas. The room was amazing. I loved the view !!
20,We experienced rudeness and the room was not of quality. We had no where to hang our clothes nor did we have a laundry bag. I could have stayed in a Hilton home 2 suites and had a better room. Very disappointed.
50,The Park was terrific all around but I have to admit it smells much better than any other hotel casino we visited. We will never stay in another property that allows their guests to be subjected to second hand smoke. Thanks for having the courage and foresight to its guests and employees
50,Park MGM is very affordable and accessible to everything. The staff are excellent including the rooms. I would recommend the Park MGM to my friends and families. I will be going back to MGM park next time I go to Las Vegas.
30,We had trash from previous gust we found hair on the bathroom sink we always coming  To park mgm we like everything about this casino I ask for full refund or free nights with zero of charge that all .
50,Love this hotel. Smoke free and a nice size casino you can always find who you are looking for! Clean and bright and easily connected to other properties. One complaint would be the standard rooms def need a dresser
50,This hotel exceeded my expectations tremendously. Very good vibe with a modern day feel and more eye candy than what was expected. I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting who would want to get the full Vegas experience.
40,Location is excellent great access to the MGM side of the strip. Very clean with friendly customer service. Very impressed with their Covid protocols. Casino provides lots of variety and we loved that it was non-smoking.
50,I enjoyed my stay loved the food options Italian food store convenience friendly staff great room excellent water pressure in the shower easy to navigate the hotel and casino clean and friendly!
40,The clean air is a real treat. It makes it difficult to walk into other casinos and hit that wall of smoke. Dining is much more pleasurable without sucking up smoke. Contactless check-in and check out eliminates time waiting in line. Great place to stay.
50,Everything about the property was nice. Great location and staff was very helpful and knowledgeable. If i had to recommend a great place to stay to anyone it would be the Park. Everything I needed was at the location and I didn’t have to get out much.
50,The room was clean and had a nice view. I was able to see the t-mobile arena and allegiant stadium. The staff was able to help me on a question I had when I was checking out and also checked me out at the same time. I would definitely recommend going there.
50,We stayed at Park MGM because it was a smaller and newly renovated property that was smoke free! It didn’t disappoint! We were able to get a suite at a very decent price through M Life rewards. The cabana is also very worth it and is very affordable on weekdays.
40,Stayed for 3 nights in a 2 Queen Stay Well room for a sister trip. Overall good stay.    We chose this hotel because it was smoke free and had a great location on the strip. Beds were comfortable. Stay well amenities were nice- although some were a bit hard to figure out how to use. There is a QR code to scan for more information about the amenities but unfortunately that didn’t help much.    Our room was clean with the exception of the window being pretty dirty on both sides. The room is also bare bones- no coffee maker refrigerator or mini bar. We overlooked the T Mobile Arena. They must play loud music outside the piazza there 24/7. During the night I could hear it- we were on the 23rd floor.    We loved eating at Primrose for breakfast. We also ate at Eataly which was good but expensive ($25 for basic pasta)    Starbucks on site was great although the line is very long at peak times in the morning.    I would come back here if I had an event at the arena. Not sure I would come back if I wanted a luxury stay
10,Small rooms. The ax I guess worked but didn’t cool the room woke up hot every night. Noise from the arena or something at all hours just random music from the street. Sports book is really small and only sports no horse racing. Food options were very limited and closed very early.
50,We normally stay at the MGM Grand but decided to stay at the Park MGM because it was non smoking and closer to some of the other things that we like to do on the strip. Totally worth it!! And did I mention that the beds were super comfortable and room much quieter than other hotels. Little Eataly is a great food spot within! Pools are great too - definitely worth upgrading to get at least padded pool chairs and table. We rate this hotel as an A+ and will most definitely be back many more times!
50,We came from a terrible 6hr stay at another hotel on the strip… to our rescue MGM Park had friendly welcoming staff cleanliness spacious rooms! We saw security walking the halls and smiling staff ready to help! Parking our car was a easy & quick step away and the rideshare which were quickly accessible from our elevators and the location on the strip is GREAT! We won’t go elsewhere when we come back to Vegas!
40,Even if you are handicap you have to pay for wheelchair & electric scooter per day  Also there is only 1 restaurant open for food after 11pm  The property itself is nice & provides other amenities  Overall I enjoyed my stay
30,I typically stay at the same hotel when I visit Las Vegas period this time I decided to try a new place and so I booked a room with Park MGM. Let me say that this is an older hotel that’s been redone and honestly it’s not been redone very well in the room area. The rooms are small the walls are thin ceilings are low and it’s very dark. There is a reason there are not very many room pictures . This hotel used to be the old Monte Carlo and they just threw some paint on the walls. If you’re looking for luxury this is not the place to be.    One thing I can say is that the customer service is top-notch. Every employee was on point my entire stay. A big thank you to Ashley at the front desk who helped me get as comfortable as possible. Also the hotel is non smoking so you’re not slapped when cigarette smoke when you walk in.
50,This hotel is amazing great location great price and very clean. The pools are beautiful the staff is friendly and my favorite part is the train connecting The Park MGM to the Aria and the bellagio for easy travel.
50,This was a great hotel for the price. My husband and I attended a concert at its theater so it worked out perfectly. We only stayed 1 night however we do plan on returning for a longer stay as soon as time permits.
50,First time at this property and it was a good experience I have no complaints with the overall or individual staff members everyone was very friendly and accommodating. I plan on staying here again in the very near future.
50,"This was my first stay at the Park MGM and while a bit smaller than some of the ""Big"" casinos on the strip it still had plenty of games food and amenities. Not to mention clean smoke free air. The staff was the highlight of my stay. They were so friendly and helpful I felt like a VIP there. The room was clean  quiet and had plenty of storage and nice water pressure in the shower. I forgot to mention they do allow dogs which would have been awsome if I found out ahead of time. Oh well...next time!"
40,I meet my friend for a 32 hour girlfriend stay. This was my 3rd time staying at the Park. The rooms are clean and comfortable. I love the online check and electronic key. No need to wait in line. Many food options many slots and table options.
50,Park MGM is the only place we stay when in Las Vegas .. totally smoke free hotel and casino .. direct access to hotel elevators from lobby .. amazing pools .. splurge on a cabana if you can .. great customer service and security presence .. will be back in December for Foo Fighters !
50,Property and staff were excellent and took care of all our needs! They assisted our room needs and provided a complimentary dinner for four! Truly wonderful staff! Would recommend staying at this property! Will be staying here again on our next trip!
30,Just needed a place to sleep and shower so it worked. I was bummed that i found pubic hairs in the bathroom upon arrival and hair on the bathroom counter. Could have been avoided. The room is pretty outdated though.
40,Easy walking distance to everything on the Strip. Friendly staff. We could have used a refrigerator as the desert humidity makes having lots of water a necessity. Refrigerator-cooled water would have been great
50,Clean all employees were very accommodating! Smoke Free!!  Primrose restaurant employees met our every need as did house staff.  I’ve stayed here for the last 5-6 years and this new makeover is the best. Looking forward to next year!
50,Love the hotel clean and had a great experience. Staff was friendly and love that it’s smoke free. Love the tournament I hope I get invited again. We would definitely stay there again. Please keep smoke free
20,The room was dirty. It looked like it had not been used in a long time. Dust was on every surface. Water rings on all of the flat surfaces. The snack bar was covered in dust. The drinking glasses were filthy. We brought them down to the VIP desk to complain and were told that we needed to take them back to the room. Very unprofessional  .
40,I attended a conference at the Park MGM in early September. Two highlights of the property. 1) the casino is smoke free and 2) the food court near the Strip. The rooms are cozy modern and spacious.  They did a major remodel a few years ago. What I appreciated the most was mobile check in; I checked in on my phone after landing before deplaning and received a digital key. No more waiting in line to check in at registration this can be a huge time saver depending on what day and time of day you arrive.    Also major improvements to the pool area with multiple pools and plenty of chaise lounges.
50,The casino and entire property are non smoking and while I didn’t notice it the first night having entered the casino beside it at the aria you quickly realize how incredible non smoking is. The rooms were nice with walk in showers but didn’t have a desk. They did have a table and overall very well situated. I also could not hear any neighbors which was great.
50,Love every thing about this place. Smoke free is an excellent idea for a casino there are plenty of other casinos to smoke at. Eataly is a great concept for a restaurant. The place is so convenient to so many places on the strip that it’s a no brainer to stay here.
50,As usual the Staff were efficient and friendly the food exceeded expectations and the facilities clean and fresh including our Suite. Highly recommend . We gambled mornings a lot and afternoons mostly and totally enjoyed the experience
50,standing in line for 20 minutes at starbucks to get a coffee is terrible. there should be a cart etc to dispense coffee only. I would be sitting at a slot machine instead of being in line. Makes good business sense for you more convenient for your guests. worst part of my stay was standing in line for so long for a coffee! Hotel manager needs to see the morning line for coffee!
50,Stay was excellent made better by smoke free atmosphere! Thoroughly enjoyed Eataly short lines were a bonus. The number of sports betting keyosks also enhanced the sports betting experience could bet in quick if needed
40,I am happy I chose the Park MGM hotel. The location is great the beds are comfy and the water pressure in the shower is fantastic. The rooms are a bit small and there is no fridge or coffee maker in the room but the no smoking feature makes this hotel a winner. The hotel smells fantastic!! We stayed here for the Bruno Mars concert and it was so convenient to just ride the elevator down and go to the concert. The Park Theater is a great venue. I will definitely stay here again—in fact I have already booked another stay for November.
50,Luxury property with pretty good selection of new slot machines both new and old. Shower has high water pressure with quick temperature  regulator. Very comfortable king mistress with high quality comforter.  Fitness center wasn’t busy and very clean.
50,Outstanding time in Las Vegas during the stay at Park MGM place is really clean easy to check in nearly virtually check in and out. Room are clean and staff are awesome and friendly worth a trip back to Las Vegas
50,Park MGM is one of our favorites- not too crazy easy to get around great food options including Eataly!! Great location & within walking distance to other restaurantscasinos & shopping for basics - rooms very clean & entire property smoke free!!
50,Great place to stay. I love that it is non-smoking which makes the air much fresher than the other resorts. Hopefully this will catch on as they don’t seem to be losing any business. It’s also close to other resorts and are in walking distance.
50,Tried out Park MGM since it was a smoke free casino. For a non smoker I appreciate the smoke free environment. You get to enjoy the table games and slots without choking.  Room was clean and comfortable. Good dining choices too. Already booked my next trip in Nov 2021. Can’t wait!!
50,Had 2 nice side by side rooms with our girlfriends and it was a lot of fun love. Loved that the entire casino is smoke free. Wish the pool was a bit deeper but overall it was awesome. Housekeeping was super nice and accommodating us too
40,"Clean and pleasant. We did have an issue when my husband passed out (from low potassium according to the ER.) Security rushed to us but they were totally focused on making their report rather than my husband. When paramedics arrived security kept interrupting them to ask my husband and myself more security questions! It was all about making sure they weren't liable and not about my husband's safety and health. Additionally no one followed up with me to make sure I was ok or to offer assistance to help me get to the hospital (I'm in a wheelchair - double leg amputee.) No one followed up ever to see if either of us was ok. I realize it's not their ""job"" to make sure their ""guests"" (eye-roll) are ok but Park MGM Las Vegas - you guys and gals are stone-cold when it comes to basic human kindness."
10,Left my dress shirt on a hanger in the closet and called to retrieve it but was told it was not found. Called the host lost & found as well as security but response was very slow. I don't recommend this property to anyone based on this experience.
40,"Great location on Las Vegs Strip very nice restaurants (a little pricey). The Italian Themed Food area was a blast  appropriately named ""EATALY'.  Nice staff comfortable rooms.  Good assortment of Gaming  Food &shops."
40,the hotel is an excellent location reasonable prices. Overall nice place. Stayed there for two nights. It was my second trip to this hotel and I think going in the future when on my trips to Las Vegas.
50,This was the second time we stayed at Park MGM while attending Pack Expo the hotel staff is friendly easy check-in process and the rooms are very comfortable. Love the location on the strip and the Park Theater is a great venue to catch a concert.
10,Rude front desk staff room service stops at 2pm the air conditioning in the room only worked 10% of the time. The casino floor is empty 95% and you still can’t find any service staff for a drink. The entire staff seems super annoyed with any question.
50,We saw a concert at the Park Theater. It was super convenient being able to stay onsite. Park MGM is a really nice property with good amenities (Starbucks good food options parking at reasonable rates). The best part for me though is that it’s non smoking.
50,I love this Hotel and Casino is NONSMOKING! Service was great 👍. Good variety of machines in the Casino. Rooms were good size and clean. Park MGM is in a great location to get to the freeways easily. Awesome staff. We were there 6 days everything was a great experience. My only disappointment was we were on the 18 th floor and getting off the elevator it was kind of dark and carpets were stained. But room was nice and clean.
50,One of if not the best hotels we stay at. Very attentive staff and service across all platforms is impeccable. Very clean and love the fact that it is smoke free. Will be staying at this hotel many more times 10 out of 10
40,Pay in advance they tack on a lot of fees that make a discounted room feel more like full price. I stayed at the Hilton downtown Denver for cheaper than I did at a discounted room in Vegas at the MGM. The charges in fees exceeded what the room was quoted to me for.
50,Fabulous property! Smoke free well maintained clean and friendly staff. Housekeeping will only maintain room if asked. All restaurants on property had great food. Three pools and on weekends only one pool is adult only wish this was all the time.
50,The best bang for your buck! Super clean rooms and it’s non smoking property. Location is great right in the middle of everything. Only down fall is that the beds are not comfortable. But it’s Vegas who sleeps.
30,Facility accommodated me needing a wheelchair accessible room very quickly. As far as comps did not provide any which other hotels on the same level would usually supply other than that some sheets had stains still after being cleaned.
30,"PROs:  - Great location  - Great restaurants - La La Noodles Best Friend and Eataly  - Non-smoking casino  - Stay Well Rooms - air purifier and other small wellness enhancements  - Great modern rooms for the price  - M Life Pearl members and up get free parking across all MGM properties.  - Service is great for the price you pay.    CONS:  - Rooms aren't hospital clean but ok for the price you pay.  - Housekeeping is a bit disorganized.    So if you could compare Park MGM to a brand it would be like Starbucks. It's nothing ""WOW"" but it's not as bad as McDonald's. Excalibur and New York and New York are McDonald's. For the price you pay you get a little more than what you pay for. Every associate I've encountered were friendly and extremely nice. Shout out to Andrea at the VIP check-in. If there are avails you can pay for a late check-out which is $50 or prices can vary if you call the front desk the day of. She suggested not to use to the app.    I had a housekeeping issue when I was told someone would come at 11AM but did not. Then instructed them to come at 5PM which they didn't. It got to the point where I had to call the manager and have her come speak with me to which she apologized and gave me a $25 food voucher to be used at any restaurant at Park MGM. Also I found long blonde hairs in the shower and a random booger popped out of nowhere. But I am not complaining because of the value. You can't expect Bergdorgs Goodman service when you're paying Target prices.    Rates are great during the week when there isn't a convention. I would definitely come back and stay here but wouldn't stay here on the weekends where rates can be $400 a night."
50,Hotel and casino are well-appointed very clean and the best part is the no smoking policy. Every member of the staff we encountered were friendly and attentive. Our first day there we saw a gentleman that had a bit too much to drink and was getting loud and security was there in half a second. If we go back to Vegas we will only stay at Park MGM!
40,The hotel and rooms were great it felt very clean and safe. The casino is a good size and was a lot of fun. The hotel is in a good location walking distance to Cosmopolitan and NYNY. However food in the Eataly is overpriced and underwhelming.
50,This hotel was a great value for what you receive smell good was very clean the staff was very helpful and professional. The casino was great I have no complaints and I would definitely recommend this hotel to others.
40,It is great to be able to walk through a casino without choking in a cloud of smoke or to go to your room and put your head down at night into a stale smokey pillow!!!    The Park MGM staff is on the ball friendly ready and willing to serve their guests. We had everything we needed.    We were impressed and will stay again when we return to LV.
40,Good location. Very nice hotel. Good value. Very nice pool area clean room and very comfortable bed. A good overall experience. Less: The prices for food and beverage are expensive (25 for a drink at the pool...). Except for that it is a good choice.
30,My Stay review. I think that the property should have a microwaves and a refrigerator in the rooms. I also believe that it should not be a fee to check in early for a fee especially if rooms are already available. Many people are arriving from out of town.
50,Excellent view from my room. The queen sized bed was very cozy and relaxing. Overall a great stay and excellent value. The room was spacious. The bathroom was great with a large shower and great water pressure.
50,My stay was great. The rooms were clean and the nonsmoking element was greatly appreciated. There is a restaurant called Lala Noodle. It was so delicious. I highly recommend. Also there is an area called Eaterly with numerous food and pastry options. The coffee was also very delicious. I would definitely stay here again.
10,The walls are paper thin wifi constantly does not work front desk seems like hating their job and won't provide you service that you would like when you on vacation. Extending one more night online was only $54 but reception quoted $240.
50,Park MGM is centrally located. Amazingly clean. Fantastic restaurant and bar selection. Best of all the casino isn't a maze. You don't find yourself lost like other casinos. Lastly most of the pools are 18+ which is awesome.
40,Loved the freshness of the Park. Pools have a chill vibe which I love. That’s rare in Vegas. Primrose restaurant had the best breakfast. Disappointed with the $15 monitors from the pool….I swear there wasn’t a drop of alcohol in it. Otherwise this place is a winner.
50,Had a great time it was my birthday trip and I will definitely go back can’t wait to go back!!! Restaurants were awesome gaming was very cool had just a wonderful time overall!!!! The offer they gave me was incredible!!!
30,The hotel is in a good location (less than a minute walk to T-mobile area) and self parking was close but expensive. Be prepared to stand in long lines for restaurants checking in Starbucks waiting to elevator- just long lines everywhere.
50,"I only wish I could buy a Diet Coke. Pepsi is simply NOT OK! I would stay at another property except the non-smoking policy of Park MGM makes it the best property in the entire city. The only thing it needs to be ""perfect"" is Coke products."
40,Great location. Room was a little outdated. People/staff were great! Highly recommend since you can walk to many of the MGM properties from here. Pool was a fun place too. If you're going to stay on the strip you may as well get a decent central location. We took a taxi over to Ellis Island just to have dinner. Easy to get there and back.
20,This property felt like something spring breakers would go to. I saw MGM and assumed it would be up to their other properties. Upholstery in the room had stains on it and the bathroom floor had a lot of hair on it. The room looked like it was last remodeled in the seventies. We checked out and moved to the Aria.
40,The clean air in this hotel was a game changer. I loved being away from the smoke. We rented a pod bed at the pool on our first day and it was perfect. Lots of sun and fun drinks at the pool. We started every morning with a dip in the hot tub. That's that best way to start the day. Danced at On the Record three nights. The music was great and it was so convenient to have it right in our hotel. Had great pizza and italian coffee at Eataly. It was just a great experience. So happy with it!
50,I love staying at park mgm! So clean beautiful rooms and easy check in! If you stay here make sure to check out best friend restaurant! The food is fantastic! I like that there are multiple pools available as well.
50,The only reason I gave you 5 stars are because of:    The actual 5 Stars employees in your staff Hank/John  Toshi  Kim  Pia  Karla    Please add extra customer service training to both your managers ACE & Mlife Manager (Blonde/Red Hair) working Saturday shift 10/2/21 4 pm.     Concern: You need better refrigerators my mother is a diabetic and needed to keep her insulin cold the refrigerator you brought to our room was cooling very poorly. I needed to add ice inside to help ensure her insulin stays cold. Beds were also uncomfortable hurt my back sunk in seemed like old mattresses.
40,Spent a night there (first time @ this property) and did not let us down. We loves the fact is no smoking hotel. The casino is ok nothing special. Room ok too with good bed and great space to take shower.  Comp x 1 night. Resort fee total 44 usd . Not bad at all. Took the tram to get to the bellagio. Easy check-in and check-out. C you soon
50,We used to stay at the Monte Carlo (now Park MGM). We were very happy with the room upgrades and dining experiences available. Dined at Nomad Library great food & drinks. Lunched at Eataly also great. My biggest compliment is that they are smoke-free!
30,It’s a nice hotel but not the fanciest place for the money. It’s right next to T-Mobil arena and centrally located on the strip but the hotel is not well kept. The staff was not aware of their own reward programs that were going on.
30,Good location nice to walk through to other hotels. Smaller rooms air conditioner took a while to cool  Off room- especially at night sleeping room doors closing all hrs.we’re loud. Noisy from outside -  But Vegas right!?
20,While the room was large (it was called a Nightingale Suite) the sofa bed was laughably uncomfortable. And it when we arrived it had a previous guest's dirty underwear still in it! Many things in the room ddid not function properly the room was shabby and the housekeeping staff gathered each morning in the space next to our room between 6:45am-7:00am and spoke so loudly that our family was woken up and could not get back to sleep. Everything we experienced is whatI'd expect from a discount resort experience not a $500-per-night MGM stay. Ridiculous. MGM Resorts should be embarrassed but probably won't be as long as the $$ keeps rolling in.
50,The staff is awesome and very friendly!!! Great location on the strip. Felt safe in the hotel. Room is a little basic no fridge is the only thing I didn’t like. One of my new favorite hotels in Vegas.
50,This is the 3rd time I've stayed here this year and each time I appreciate it even more! Love that there is no smoking in the hotel or casino the pools are fabulous the location really can't be beat and the staff always goes above and beyond! I think I have a new favorite!
30,My room was not very good for the price. It was like staying at a Holiday Inn on the strip. Plane room nothing fancy and charged a premium price. Also I was very impressed with the restaurant in the resort. The Primerose had slow service and was overpriced for the quality of food I got.
20,We had stayed at the Park several times before and it’s been fine but it’s gone downhill.  Online check-in didn’t work we waited about 4 hours for room finally went to check and told room was ready the digital key wasn’t accessible the app said I had no reservation (wish the app told my credit card that). M-life rewards didn’t post points on the good side we finally gave up using most MGM facilities as we didn’t get points and had bad service at a couple of resort restaurants. The stay well room features didn’t work.  Tried to get some items resolved but after several call (about 90 mins total) on phone we gave up.  The issues we had maybe related to covid possibly staff shortages although service at other resorts seemed to be better.
40,We just got home from a long weekend in Vegas. This is a nice hotel. We didn’t have a view and the contactless check-in made it so I couldn’t request one during check-in. We had a nice couple of afternoons at the pool attended Bruno Mars at the hotel venue and appreciated the non-smoking environment.
50,The room was very clean and comfortable. The location is perfect for enjoying the fun of Vegas. The noise before a hockey game is disconcerting but it ends almost immediately after the game. If you are out on the town you would never know this negative. The staff is friendly.
40,The stay was okay. My husband and I came down for the Bruno Mars concert. The front desk service was pretty good and friendly. The room was okay for the evening although the bed was very low to the floor and the old lamp with the cord going up the wall. Bathroom well stocked and the water got hot really quick. Loved the blackout curtains. I think the hotel can do a better job with the carpet in the hallway. Very dirty!!!!
50,Stayed for UFC fight on Saturday and Raiders home game on Sunday. Fantastic venue. Centrally located for everything. Staff was exceptional. Beds were SUPER comfy pillows were king size as was the mattress. Great food options in Best Friend and Eataly. Nearby to everything. Will stay here again.
10,Carpet was dirty and stained. Hotel room and corridor are dark. Staff promised to waive the resort fee for us for service recover but was not followed through. Agent at check out refused to anything to accommodate even though there were notes on our reservation showing Carla at front desk promised to waive the resort fee
50,Flight arrived early in the day. Still checked in and straight to room. One of my concerns at most casinos is the effect smoking has on my clothes and sinuses. At the Park MGM that is not an issue. In room dining was great. We enjoyed breakfast every morning and it was well prepared and delivered quickly.
50,Good location. Walking distance to many other resorts attractions shops and restaurants. TMobile arena is steps out side the door. Smoke free. Rooms were clean and updated. Plenty of good dining options. Pool area is nice with option in the sun and shade.
50,"Staff friendly room clean as a whistle casino perfectly-sized pool top notch. Not a ""party hotel"" and that's another plus. Hotel decor is classy not overboard kitsch. Very relaxing to go back to after a night on the town my first choice in Vegas hotels."
10,For the second time in two months I was charged 50 dollars for a food credit I was supposed to receive. I was not sent an email receipt after checking out so I was unaware I was charged until I looked my card balance.
40,Great location next to T Mobile Arena and on the strip. Lots of restaurants in the area and Eataly is a beautiful bright space with plenty of choices Italian themed. Great links to the Aria and Bellagio via a tram system and connected to walkways over the strip.
50,This place has so much to offer. I loved the non smoking. Staff on casino floor were wonderful and courteous. We stayed in the nighthawk suite and was really impressed with it. We travel to Vegas every year and have stayed at other hotels but Park MGM is our absolute favorite!
50,I had not been in Las Vegas for nearly a decade and I was surprised this is a non-smoking facility (hotel and casino). This facility is for visitors who prefer not to be secondary smokers like me!    MGM app for mobile phones needs a lot of improvement! I booked two rooms (one for myself and the other for my relatives) and used the app to check in on both rooms. I can only use my phone to obtain the electronic key for my room and pay parking ($15/day). When I contacted Park MGM by phone to obtain assistance for another electronic key I was told to use a different mobile phone to obtain for another electronic key. When I did that the app need to verify my ID by asking me to input my ID password! I only set up ID password once I renewed my CA State driver license last year and don't use it often! How do I remember the password to use on the app! I am sure other guests who booked more than one room will also have a hard time to recall their own ID passwords!    In addition when I checked in the second room my name was also listed on the second room (Noted that my name is also listed on the first room!). Therefore I could only list 3 not 4 guest names on the app!    In short I decided to obtain the keys to two rooms at the check-in counter! This MGM app needs a lot of improvement!
10,Very outdated. They have the bare minimum in the rooms. No mini bar or cups and terrible decor. Felt like a mobile home from the 60s. Don’t waste your money. Everything needs to be updated. The prices should be much cheaper too.
50,Easy check in we didn’t even have to wait in line. They have staff with iPads that can do it all. We were even asked if we had any specific requests about the room we got. The room was very clean and a great view. The restaurant’s at this hotel were also so good especially Eately.
40,Rooms are smaller than most resorts in LV but don’t let that fool you - exceptionally clean and well appointed - the shower was amazing - staff was friendly and accommodating. Eataly has a great vibe -free tram access from Park MGM -
50,2 Rooms using comp rewards. Check-in and out room key and parking garage via the MGM app. Great location on the strip. Access to the other MGM hotels via the tram. Lots of dining choices. MGM rewards card earns gaming points at all MGM properties.
50,One of the security members (Nana) assisted me with directions and recommended that I visit Eately and Park MGM’s club OTR. I was in town for one of the Raiders games and these two extra spots made our weekend visit more memorable. Thank you!
50,Great location staff facility and casino!    As you walk out of hotel you are near the middle of the strip with many options to places to eat shop other casinos etc.    Multi pools casino restaurants etc. you could literally stay at the resort and not need to leave.    We had a great time!
50,The only smoke-free hotel in the strip. Excellent COVID-19 safety protocols. Room was nice and clean. Friendly staff. Love Eataly. They have good bakery and coffee. Pastries are delish at Eataly. I would recommend this property to my friends and family. I will certainly stay here again on my next visit.
50,The fist thing I like about the park mgm is the location. Almost anything you could want is within walking distance. The hotel itself is beautiful and smoke free. We stayed in a basic room with a king bed. The layout of the room compared to other hotels on the strip makes you feel like your in a small sweet. My stay was perfect in my opinion and I will never stay at another hotel in las vegas.
50,Check in and checkout was super easy and on app. Our room was ready by noon and clean. Bed is comfy room spacious and shower was great! Lost of water pressure unlike other hotels.  Staff was nice and restaurants were great!
30,WiFi did not allow electronic key to work to access room by elevator and no access to room with cell phone app room key. Had to go all the way to the front desk stand in line for a plastic room key. Cost me 1/2 HR of my time. MGM app would not let me check out. Had to call guest services. Lost money as usual on Park MGM slots. Saw no hand pays as another sign of low pay out tight machines.
40,Hotel was very clean great bar and club located inside the hotel. The bar was a mixture of adults of various ages and the club had different areas for different vibes and there is a speakeasy insdie!
40,This is the first time I stayed at Park MGM and it was a very pleasant stay. It is very clean and it a plus that it is a non-smoking hotel. Checking in is very easy. The front desk person was very helpful. It is good that it is close to other M Life resorts. I will definitely stay here again
40,It's the more affordable MGM property that is close to the area we wanted to be. We use the Aria tram to save a little bit of walking. We stayed in a Stay Well room but I can't say that it really stands out from the other room types. Though I haven't stayed in this hotel since it was the Monte Carlo. (I still enjoyed it as the Monte Carlo because of the location.)  We ate at Best Friend where the food is so good. So. Good. We had the Kogi Short Rib tacos Slippery Shrimp and a special Mango Cheesecake that was new on the menu (recommended by the bartender). We were lucky enough to meet Roy Choi too! (We're big fans of The Chef Show.)  We ate pizza at Eataly area. Pizza was ok. We'll need to venture to the other places so I don't have much feedback here.  One of the restaurants needs a little attention. On our last day we ate at the Primrose. I ordered Steak and Eggs. The steak looked like it could have been from Sizzler. (I really wish I took a picture.) The flavor was good because of the chimichurri but it was a cheaper cut of meat.  We wanted something a little healthier for breakfast on one of our mornings so went to Pressed Juicery located next door in Aria. Also went for coffee at Starbucks. (If you go to Starbucks go to the location next to convention room side where it's hidden. The other Starbucks by Pressed had a super long line.)  We were poolside for one afternoon and that was pretty mellow. The pools are standard - no lazy rivers or waterfalls. It got the job done though. We cooled off.  The hotel is smoke free too which we really appreciated. We had a drain backed up in the tub on check in and maintenance took care of it immediately. The guy was really nice took. He greeted me in the hallway before knowing he was going to be taking care of an issue.  Housekeeping was great too. The attendant was very nice and checked in on us to see if there’s anything else we needed. We had asked for some extra towels and other items. She didn’t have face towels on her cart. The maintenance guy overheard and said that he will have someone bring a set up. A few minutes later we had the towels.  The customer service was outstanding. There was the person at check in and the garage attendant at checkout who were great. That’s what it should be right? It’s not always the case.  I don’t want to make this review any longer but it was a great experience.
50,Park MGM is a fantastic hotel. Customer Service is second to NONE. Staff experience was courteous and went above and beyond to make our experience a magical. We will definitely stay with MGM resorts as our preferred destination. Personal Thank You to Guillermo S for his courteous and attentive service!
40,Very nice and convenient location. Room is AOK but the foods court is great. The casino is small but have plenty of option on games. Great casino staffs - had a great time and won $$$ for games that I had not played before. Will comes back next week for more 😜
30,The property is in a great location. However the standard guess rooms below average and very small. The service overall wasn't as great as other MGM properties that I've stayed at.. we usually stay at MGM Grand Vdara Cosmoor Aria. This was out first time at Park MGM and we decided to stay because had yet to stay there. Needless to say that was our first and last stay. The overall logistics between PMGM and Nomad are so disconnected.
30,Lack of attention to detail is what the problem was here. The sink hardly drained. There was black marks on the bathroom floor splatters on the walls and lipstick smeared on the bathroom wall. I travel Clorox wipes so I wiped everything down including all surfaces remotes signage light switches and handles since I didn’t feel the room was cleaned adequately for my unvaccinated 11 year old to be safe. I expected better from a Stay Well room. Also the air purifiers filter need changed and the light indicator was on. There is basically no closet space so be prepared to have your suitcase in the middle of the room or taking up the bench. Which made the room feel very cramped. We ended up checking out early and going to Vdara. Definitely worth it. It was actually $50 less per night for us to make the switch and the stay/quality was much better!
50,Super location (especially if going to the T-Mobil)  love the non-smoking excellent value. I would say make sure you know what type or level of room your are booking.. but all rooms are very clean and well maintained
30,So the bed was awesome but the cleaners left the older people’s shampoo and conditioner in the shower and I also don’t think they finished cleaning because our friends had mask bag in there room and we didn’t.
40,The hotel itself was excellent. The eatery was a nice touch. My only complaint is the rooms are very warm regardless what you set the AC at. It wasn’t just my room but friends in other rooms experienced the same issue. It wasn’t hot but definitely warm.
50,We had a great trip loved the non-smoking casino and the eating establishments around the resort. Room was very clean and the staff was friendly and very helpful. Would recommend this resort to friends.
50,Hotel was clean staff was nice room was spacious and had a good view of the strip. Close to Eataly for food which was nice. Rooms do not have desks if you are there for business. I do not know why TripAdvisor imposes a 200 character minimum on reviews. Reviews should be as long as I feel like writing.
10,The resort is perfect clean accommodating and a great location but if there is a home hockey game or concert across from the stadium do not plan to use your room as it will seem like the concert or DJ is in there with you it is so loud. Traffic around the stadium on game days is also poor. Took us and hour to get to the hotel from the airport because a hockey game was going on. Only 15 minutes to get to the airport when there was no game.
50,Spent the trip with friends. Everything went well with our stay no complaints on my end. Great environment for family as well with no smoking allowed inside the Hotel and Casino. Would recommend staying here for friends and family.
50,Smoke free! Smells like essential oils. Great room and staff! So natural and earthy. I would definitely be staying here again next time in Vegas. Convenient check in and virtual key if your out shopping still!
20,Room felt like an upgraded motel 6. “Strip view” was overlooking a roof and the m&m store/target. Beds are low platform beds. Charged $18 for a small bottle of water in the room. No amenities in the bathroom as far as qtips cotton balls shower cap. Toilet had to be flushed just right. Lightbulb missing by bed. A/c would only go down to 68’ but felt like 74’. Too hot in room for sleeping. Staff did not provide excellent service. Rarely a cocktail waitress when gambling there. Resort fee. Couldn’t bring to go food orders to pool. Overall disappointing.
50,Newly remodeled very clean. good location. Not all food selections open or those that are continue to have limited staffing. There are plenty of options on the street for food. I would stay here again.
50,LOVE. Would recommend to a friend! Love that it’s non smoking! Clean shops are great tram is convenient. Only inconvenient thing about it is that you can’t get to a floor unless you have a room key for that floor. I love how safe that is for guests but it made it inconvenient for my friends and I to get to each other’s rooms. But I would still stay here next trip based on the non smoking alone.
50,I really enjoy at this hotel but alllife properties are great..but I like the no smoking casino as well as the hidden lil bars it has...the closeness to TMobile arena is also great...thank u for the great time!!!
30,The antiquated pull chain window shades resonate throughout the adjoining rooms when guests stroll in at 3am. Bed way too warm don't understand the heavy bedding in the desert AC said 65 but not a chance. Shower has great water pressure but with Lake Meade running dry maybe tone it down a notch. Also if there is an event at TMobile arena it creates a traffic disaster if you want a ride share or taxi you will have issues with them getting there. 5 Stars for non smoking propety
50,Great location room and amenities. Primrose is great and so is the spa. I felt on cloud 9 after my full body massage. Pool was clean with plenty of seating. Plenty of casino games to play and sports to bet on. What’s not to live about this hotel and casino.
50,Had a great stay will be staying here from now on! The food was amazing the rooms were nice. I love that we come back at the end of the night to a none smoking resort. They had excellent service from the front desk to the drink servers!
40,location is good food is good pool was good rooms are in need of a dresser. bathrooms in rooms are small and minimal places to put toiletries towels and clothing. make sure you make reservations at Primrose or you will wait.
40,Park MGM was very nice and conveniently located. With quick access near the Strip T-Mobile the Patk and NYNY  there was plenty to walk to if needed. Also we realized what this non smoking casino meant to our clothes our hair and throats after visiting other casinos on our stay. It was refreshing to know you can gamble without breathing in 2nd hand smoke. Besides a draining problem in our sink it was a nice stay.
50,Will stay again. Close to the action but with a small personal feel. All the amenities needed are here! Great food option. Adult area pool space. Comfy beds. Took my almost 21 year-old for a Mom/Son trip to the UFC and Golden Knights across the street at the T-Mobile Arena. Perfect location in the middle of plenty of action!
40,Just got back from a 5 day stay at Park MGM. It was my 1st time there as I was in town for International Fight Week by the UFC. Park MGM did an excellent job each day of keeping my room clean and having my bed sheets new and changed each day. Suri the cleaning lady was extremely friendly and helpful. She should get a raise and Park MGM needs to keep her! She does a great job with these rooms. Other than that Dustin was pretty helpful at the front desk as well. The location was awesome as well since it's literally next door to T-Mobile arena and the center of the strip. Nothing was too far to walk to. The only issue I had was the shower wouldn't drain but the maintenance guy was on this each day to make sure it was fixed so I could use it each day. Overall I'd stay here again and is worth the price. Highly recommend them especially for a T-Mobile Arena event.
40,Park MGM stay was good experience. Cleanliness average- towels and sheets were clean but carpets need replaced. Decor is plain. Convenient walk to ride share/Uber pickup and MGM tram. Nomad bar was amazing-good food drinks and service. Whatever scents they used in the lobby smelled so good.
50,very nice hotel very clean rooms felt safe to stay at. Staff was great check in was fast and easy . Very close to other hotels and shopping areas on the strip across from NY NY and connected with Aria..
20,I've stayed in different hotels over the years in Vegas and this is a first having to pay over 300 for what they call unlimited parking? Every other hotel I've stayed; parking in their hotel was included in the hotels fees.
20,This hotel is right near the T-Mobile arena so all of the pre-game music and festivities are beyond loud in the room. We were on the 3rd floor and the bass from the speakers at the arena is ridiculous along with the volume of the announcer. I expect to come to Vegas and not get a ton of sleep but this is beyond annoying as there were 2 home games during our stay.    If you don't drink coffee it's not an inconvenience but if you do there are no in-room coffee maker. So pack your patience for the morning line at Starbucks (or grab coffee at Eataly)    The water pressure in the showers is also terrible. On the positives the casino and restaurants are nice but I will never stay here again.
50,I enjoyed my stay from check in to check out. The staff members are amazing! Hotel offers one the ability to never leave hotel gaming good food (pricey but good) spa pool very nice! I would stay again close to T-Mobile stadium walking distance.
40,Overall a great experience. Hotel is great with no smoking. Tables prices a tad high so didn’t play on any of them love the location as well. The only issue was the air conditioning was very bad. Room set on 65 and never went below 70 for 4 days
50,We just finished a bus tour of the Old Wild West and it ended in beautiful Las Vegas We had a great time on our trip and staying at the Park MGM to end it was just perfect. The service starting at the check in desk was great and the food at the Park MGM was excellent and we had the best three night sleep in their comfortable beds! We didn't hear anything from our neighbors the whole time when we were in our room. Our room was overlooking the strip and we could see the planes leaving the airport. There are a lot of hotels on the strip and this was our first time and when we go back we are planning on staying at the Park MGM. The staff was excellent and they had plenty of restaurants and we got the Best General Gau's chicken ever at the Noodle restaurant. You have to get the pancakes at the restaurant in the front lobby. They were delicious!! You can also do wine tasting at the eaterly which is located at the end of Park MGM. The two ladies that run that place are awesome!!
20,Looks like all of the renovations made from converting the Monte Carlo were only spent on the public hallways and lobbies. Our room was so dingy. The room never cooled down much despite the air condition being set on high and at 60°. I started to sweat in my sleep while only using a sheet to cover.    I had read about the rooms being warm and the walls being thin but I decided to book anyway because of the deal I got. It was a mistake!!! The walls are soooooo thin. It startled me every time I heard my neighbor adjusting their blinds because it was a loud rattling sound.    The carpet had stains and even worse— one comforter (mine) and one bath towel (friend's) had BROWN stains. I gagged when I saw the brown crusty stain on my comforter. Housekeeping changed out my bedding and the new top sheet had a huge purple stain (folded under the comforter top). Is this hotel that frugal that they won’t throw out stained sheets?!    The only saving graces are the non-smoking casino floor a Starbucks by the guest elevators and hotel's proximity to the Aria tram.
50,The location was great for our trip we were attending a UFC event at the T-Mobile arena. There are several food options both inside the hotel and in very close walking distance outside of the hotel. The room was clean and the staff was friendly.
50,Location and smoke free environment canʻt be beat. Casino was clean and slot machines were well spaced. Good choices of restaurants. Eataly offered good selection of food items but make sure you check them all out instead of heading straight to the first shop you see.
50,Great value for a great property with three pools Eataly and two of my new favorite restaurants Best Friend and Bavettes. The staff was friendly and the rooms were 70’s chic. My friend’s Nighthawk suite was even cooler. Loved that it was smoke free as well.
50,Hotel is in a great location it’s very Clean. Staff are amazing. Very friendly  Would recommend this place highly. All protocols followed. All stores and restaurants all amazing.  Casino staff very friendly
20,Room smelled like pot and was sparsely furnished. Not enough towels. No coffee maker. No minfridge unless requested. Check in area in lobby way too small. Food was overpriced. Primrose restaurant breakfast food and coffee was luke warm. Eatly is fun but also overpriced. Smoke free casino is a plus. Good location and easy self parking.
40,Stayed for the slot tournament and worked remotely in hotel. Ethernet Jack worked for 4 hrs and then quit. Front desk suggested to use WiFi which worked for a 3 person zoom meeting and the rest of my remote work. Staff was friendly pool was relaxing.
30,The Park MGM is a very nice hotel. My room faced the Mobile stadium but it was nice and quiet. Moreover the room was spacious with a good sized bathroom. Unfortunately the Park MGM will charge you for your deposit and a resort fee upon check-in. Not cool. All fees should have been disclosed when I booked the room. Especially when I tried to cancel the room and they said I wouldn't be able to get my deposit back...which I assumed was that I'd already paid online. Nope. That's something else entirely. Buyer beware.
40,The Park MGM is located in a great location on the strip. I like that the property is non-smoking. The rooms are clean comfortable and affordable. There is a great selection of restaurants and plenty of places for libations.
50,My girlfriend and I checked into park MGM on a Sunday… We had tickets to the first preseason NHL game for the Golden Knights for the 2021 season… Within five minutes of checking in there was a knock at the door and two gentleman in suits who are employees of Park MGM introduced themselves -Willie (I didn’t get his last name) and Willie Sanchez. They welcomed us to the hotel and genuinely seemed excited for us to be staying there… Once they found out that we were locals on a staycation and going to the game they gave us a complementary coupon for food or beverage at the hotel. …this little 5 minute encounter might seem trivial but since both my girlfriend and I are in customer service it had a huge impact on our view of the property as a whole.  We enjoyed food at the My Best Friend restaurant- went to the game right across the street at T- Mobile Arena and came back and had cocktails at the main circle bar. We both won some money and went back to our room and fell asleep in a very comfortable king size bed.  We will definitely return to Park MGM and - but honestly- the two Willies are what made our day! Good job MGM!!
40,Location is is great. Food was delicious. Staff was courteous and went the extra mile. Pool vibe was nice. My only real complaint is the walls are thin. I could literally hear conversations in the room next door.
50,Great stay in the perfect location if attending a T-Mobile event or a Raiders game! Love that it's none smoking in the entire hotel and casino. Eataly is really cool and different from any other hotel/casino.
50,This was our second time at the Park MGM and it didn’t disappoint. We stayed in the Nighthawk Suite which is comfortable roomy and has every amenity needed for a great stay. The pools are fabulous and have a bar at every one with food choices available at each one. The hotel is non-smoking which is a plus. Excellent choices in restaurants and bars. And a perfect size casino. Definitely will be staying at the Park MGM on all future trips to Las Vegas.
20,We have been to Bavette’s several times so we decided to stay at Park MGM since the restaurants and casino floor is so nice.    However we were fooled when we got the our room. The halls look spooky…dark and dreary. The rooms are cheap and are already wearing after the recent remodel. The shower head had mildew all over it and wallpaper was peeling.    Play and dine here but stay elsewhere.
50,Being from RI summer is basically over by mid September. We needed a little extra sun and fun and we could not have picked a better place. From check in to check out everything was great. We stayed in a king wellness room and you can really feel the difference. The restaurants were great our favorite was Primrose. The cabana and pool were just what we needed. The service throughout was great. Will definitely return!
40,Great value solid rooms and fantastic location. The hotel isn't going to blow you away but it's a solid hotel for a great value in a central location on the strip. Loved the non-smoking casino but the pool area could be better. Nice restaurants on premises and good-sized casino and rooms.
20,I get better service at other places Ed but acknowledge I pay a different price at other locations. So I guess you just get what you pay for.. it was fine. The pool area is lacking a bit. Some good restaurants.
50,Truly enjoyed the hotel and our room but really wish we did not have to leave the hotel to get late night eats and drinks. Other than that I would stay here again. If your a smoker the exit to smoke is not to far away. So even for a couple like my husband and I he is a smoker I am not it still worked perfect.
10,it's bad comfort it's bad the rooms i didn't sleep at ease    the air makes a lot of noise and doesn't let you sleep    I did not have hot water    the view was bad the window was too small    I will not stay here again
40,Very nice hotel. Automated check in and checkout was very easy. Key system (on the phone) was erratic at best. Restaurant service differed from excellent in the Primrose and the Pasta place to The Steak house that was poor and unfriendly.
10,Heard neighbors and T mobile arena until 3am every night .    Neighbors were doing activities and you could tell . Security staff acts like secret service agents at the Park Theater . Ruined my show and my experience.
10,Housekeeping admitted to throwing a bag away by mistake. Hotel manager said they were looking for my items. Didn't ask what they were or brand of items. Spoke with hotel operations to resolve the issue and got a lowball offer to replace the items. Was told there was no one higher in command. Upon research got a number for Senior Hotel Operations Manager. I left 3 messages and haven't got a call back.
50,Waiter at the Bavette's Steakhouse & Bar was incredibly attentive and friendly. Also the hotel amenities are perfect newly/renovated rooms perfect location and great staff. You can choose to spend for a quality meal or go down stairs and buy your dinner to take to your room. Very convenient. Loved it.
20,Stayed here and thought the hotel was fair at best. Hallways are dark and dirty and definitely needs some renovations of the decor. Only good point was the water pressure in the shower. Would not return.
50,Stayed 3 nights in September. I like this property because of it's great location near the airport it is SMOKE FREE! The rooms are small but adequate. The pool(s) were very nice always able to get a lounge chair with an umbrella. Service for drinks/food was excellent. Casino is nice not too big. Tables these days seem to be $15 minimum which is a bit of drag prefer $10. Eataly was nice but not everything is open right now. Also had to wear masks while inside. Understand why but it is a pain. Would stay here again but want to wait until pandemic is about over and masks aren't required.
50,We went to Park MGM for the first time last week. The hotel was awesome- great dinner venues fun pools and had a great time messing around in the casino. The team to Aria and Bellagio is very convenient. Would definitely recommend.
30,Pros: smoke-free hotel 3 pools & 1 jacuzzi friendly staff clean room comfortable bed fast elevators mobile check-in tram to Bellagio.    Cons: annoying shared closet & bathroom door no coffee machine mini-fridge cotton balls q-tips plastic cups.    Park MGM is located next to the T-Mobile Arena at the end of the Las Vegas Strip. We utilized both cabs and the free tram to get around the Strip. The tram goes to the Aria/City/Center/Bellagio.    I would definitely stay here again due to the smoke-free atmosphere.
50,I stayed at the park mgm for my 33rd birthday from the time I checked in til the time I checked out the staff was friendly and helpful..I got roses sent to me an forgot them so left the airport to go get them..they made sure they got in touch with hotel security so they could go to my room an grab them for me.when I arrived back they were at check in waiting on me so I wouldn’t miss my flight..
10,Went the weekend of a UFC fight. Event setup and loud music throughout the day for the fight along with thin walls made it hard to sleep. Hotel room felt dated with exposed electrical wires bright red decor and an overall cheap feel - I’ve stayed at Holiday Inns that have been better. Hotel is also understaffed with only 2 people working the front desk.
50,Although not as splendid as the MGM Grand it was certainly a wonderful hotel.    We got initially dropped off at the MGM Grand by accident so when we figured out the error and got dropped off at Park MGM we initially were feeling let down because it's just a smaller facility but it didn't take them long to prove that they make up their size with the staff and accommodations.
30,My room was just OK nothing really to get excited about or take pictures of. For me the bed was too soft and the in room safe didn't work. The draw line for the curtain was broken so I would have to wrestle with that to bring it open or close.
40,I really enjoyed my accommodations and look forward to returning! We really will recommend this hotel to our friends and family! This my second time in Vegas. The first time I stayed in old Vegas you guys having stepped it up.
50,I really enjoyed the park it’s was very clean inside the hotel casino and rooms.  The wifi was easy to connect to and I was able to work without interruption. The Starbuck had a long line but after I put in my order it took less then 3 min to have all my items mins you it was a 15 item order with drinks pastries and cake pops. (Tip your baristas people)  Tables in the casino were not full and waitress’s were making it to us for drinks. Overall nice hotel to book last minute
40,We staayed in the beautiful NoMad Tower and the room was fantastic! Beautiful big soaker tub over 500 sgft suite with separate bathing rooms. Only negative the hotel does not offer room service after 2pm Monday thru Thrusday ( as part of the covid cutbacks) so dont plan on dinner or a late night snack in your room. Also the refrigerator was electronically locked up the entire time even though the front desk kept telling me it was fixed. Otheriwse great room and view of Tmobil arena.
50,Thanks again ma’am Bruner Calli you’re awesome my one day complimentary stays makes me feels wonderful and I do enjoy a lot great suite room friendly staff quick check in and out with free parking best of the best experience.thanks again
50,Everything was awesome and I cant wait to be back! Very clean overall. Staff was friendly and nice. Having a Starbucks is always nice to have at a casino. The transit train they have was perfect to go places!
50,We stayed here for 4 days recently and were very please with the cleanliness. The staff was eager to please and the casino while contained a great variety of entertainment was not overwhelming. Perfect size. Good restaurants especially the Eataly Food Court. Will definitely be returning.
40,Good location friendly staff. Issues with room safe that took time from our stay. Wish food choices for stuff like pizza and ice cream were open more. Main late night food choice was very busy. Over all good place to stay
30,I love how the hotel is situated. However there was dust in the ledges tables and nightstands as well as trash in the basket. Bathroom was fine beds are comfy. But being in a pandemic it was clear not everything was wiped down. Check in through the MGM app was perfection. Contactless is the way to go. All in all it was a good stay just please do better with cleaning.
50,Love staying at the Park MGM when we’re in Vegas. Great to have a fully non smoking hotel & casino. Mini suites are perfect size & hotel location is in the midst of everything Nice casual atmosphere. Great comps!
50,Over many times visiting Las Vegas this time was the most memorable and thank the Park MGM for making it easy and very comfortable for me and my family. The restaurants at the Park MGM are awesome and delicious
30,Rooms were nice but not super functional. Odd layout and no where to but our suitcases but on the couch. Small bathroom counter and not enough hooks for hanging towels and such. Overall we won't be staying again.
10,"The Racist host in the high limit room got ""sassy"" with me as I explained in detail my situation which led to my host clearing up my issue. He seemed to not like a black man telling him his issue. Also I watched as he serviced a white man and 2 white Ladies all over 50."
50,Loved this hotel! Rented 2 connecting rooms for our group it was perfect for our friends to have a hang out space. The pools were great and we loved the non smoking casino. The staff was excellent across the board!
30,The hotel resort has been clearly repurposed from the old Monte Carlo Hotel to attract a younger tech savvy less discerning demographics. The common area (casino) is fine and pleasant but limited in the abundance of table games. Slots are Ok. The fine dining restaurants are limited in number--Food court eating experience is encouraged (by design?). The guest rooms are clean and suitable but the décor and amenities will in my opinion be found to be stark and disappointing to an older crowd.
50,Enjoyed my stay. Would have wanted them to allow smoking but the place was wonderful. Gaming was great also.If I ever make it back to Vegas I would stay at this hotel again. The experience was unforgettable.
50,We absolutely loved the smoke free casino. The location of the hotel was convenient and easy to get to everything. The rooms were a little basic for our liking but the casino and pool made up for it. Friendly staff! We cannot wait to return!
50,This was a make up trip that had been planned for last April 20/20 the week before we were due to arrive Las Vegas was shut down I had always planned on making up that trip so finally it happened and it was great!!
40,Room was very bare. I believe every hotel room I've ever stayed in has had a fridge. This room did not. The check-in process was great using the app. The shower in the room had a leaky seal so every shower made the floor in the bathroom soaking wet. Luckily it was near a lot of food options and other casinos that I like so that was a positive.
50,Had a great experience ! The room was very large and clean. The staff at the front desk room service and players club that I talked with were all helpful and fun had great personalities. Long lines at the front desk and starbucks everyday but what can ya do. One of the pasta dishes from one of the Eataly stations was extremely salty couldn’t finish it. Other then that all food and beverages were great !
40,The trip was really good. I was there for a conference and some R & R. The location was really great and the food was fantastic. My ony concern was how low the beds were and the mattress was really soft and I don't do either. But otherwise it was a great place to stay.
50,This smoke-free hotel is great for families. There was no rowdiness or loudness to deal with throughout the night like other hotels. The rooms have a modern touch to them. The bed was super comfy. Overall great stay and would definitely come back here.
50,I love the vibes here. Great casino. The Nomad casino is awesome too if your have the cheddar.    Keisha at the front desk was very helpful with switching rooms. Sorry I love the hotel but do not like the red rooms. My advice would be to paint them all the lovely green motif.    Will be back for Halloween!
10,Ugly dark green halls & rooms food was AWFUL Very few restaurants Beds were on the floor Basic Breakfast for 2 was 82.00. Tournement was well run Dealers. Casino waitresses were very nice casino is nice and relaxed
30,Construction being done right in front of my door paint fumes coming inside of my room.Not able to rest and I didn’t really enjoy my stay complained to the front desk and didn’t get anywhere.No one told me that they will be doing construction that weekend
40,This updated hotel is our current top recommendation for newbies to Vegas. The convenient mid-strip location includes a free tram to the Bellagio/Aria/Vdara then across the strip you can hop on the paid monorail at the MGM Grand - this is super helpful for those who want to see visit different casinos. AND - right across are shopping options like a little Target a CVS and Walgreens so good opportunities to stock up on small snacks bottled water and even a few clothing stores in case you forgot something!  There's lots of dining options (for those who want more than Subway and Sbarro) with a lot of them pretty reasonably priced. Our most recommended was the breakfast spot Primrose. You've also got Eataly - a big ol' marketplace choc full of goodies - beware though those can be pricey.  For room size. . . we usually book double queen rooms because typically you get more room for the same price - NOT SO with Park MGM base rooms they just flip the room setup - it would probably be a SUPER tight squeeze for 4 people. The rooms are recently redone and have neat design elements with lighting and art. The King Room has a couch and table which came in handy when hosting a few friends. Basic amenities are included like iron/board hair dryer safe drawers etc. The drawers are small though!  The price is usually good when looking at comparable hotels. Currently a $39/day resort fee so keep that in mind when pricing. Also keep in mind the free tram that'll take you north on the strip and save your feet and your cab/Lyft budget!  Overall we loved the ambiance and convenience of the hotel - PLUS - it's entirely SMOKE-FREE!!!
50,I could not have enjoyed this work trip more. Everything at the hotel was perfect! I will definitely choose this hotel again for a fun trip or business. Great gym space so clean and the room was GREAT! Thank you!
50,Love park mgm … such a breath of fresh air literally it’s non smoking hotel. The best vibes and lounges like mama rabbit . The Starbucks right by the elevators is so convenient and eataly has the best Italian. Love the style and everything about this place
50,Personal trip to Vegas for iHeart Music Festival. Hotel was wonderful. Great price nice rooms clean perfect location and friendly staff. Loved the non-smoking policy throughout the hotel. I would definitely stay here again. The rooms are not large but well done and has everything you need for a few nights in Vegas. I have already recommended this hotel to friends.
50,Very comfortable and clean very nice place to stay I love that is smoke free and the security at the building it’s great I’m in love with this place I would stay there a million times more park MGM is my number one pick excellent service and very friendly staff
50,This is the perfect hotel if you don't smoke!!! the staff was great and the rooms are great. I did not eat at the resturants. Great location too. Very central on the south strip. Every one of the staff was extremly helpful!!!
50,I was attending a work conference that was being hosted at the Park MGM. The rooms were a great sized and the price was so amazing for what you got. The staff was very friendly and efficient. My only negative was that I like to sleep in freezing temps and the air never seemed to get cold in the room I constantly felt like the low to mid 70's. Other than that I had a wonderful time and would definitely stay again!
30,First off our room was complimentary through an M-Life promotion so beggars can’t be choosers. The hotel was really clean and the decor in the rooms was updated. Unfortunately we got a room with a crappy mattress and lumpy pillows. It also had terrible WiFi.    The Park is in a great location on the strip with a great choice of restaurants within walking distance. (Casino restaurants always charge an arm and a leg.) The pool was really nice and they did have some complimentary chairs but the drinks are way over priced ($52 for two pina coladas!). The casino itself was not terribly busy so we had plenty choices in slots and table games.. When you are part of M-Life they constantly send you offers for complimentary stays at MGM Brand hotels. It’s definitely worth the perks!
30,This hotel provides a nice non smoking alternative. It has very few smoking areas outside to accommodate others. It appeared well staffed and the staff was friendly and efficient. I would encourage adults 40 and up to stay here.
50,The hotel is beautiful. I would have thought it would be more expensive! Good restaurant choices and the staff was so friendly! I thought it would be further from the strip but it was actually a perfect distance
10,Room was not clean and bed was not comfortable. I wanted to check out other mgm property for my mom's 70th Birthday and it was a wrong choice of hotel to stay. We ended up switching over to Aria. Hotel wall is thin as paper we could hear everything on the other side of the wall.
50,Exactly as advertised. Check in was confusing at first but once I figured out the mgm app it was smooth sailing. The casino is cool. The dealers could use some tightening up but overall good spot for craps.
10,Check in took over 30 minutes. When booking was promised a memory foam healthy mattress - it was as hard as a rock. Room only had one chair to sit in by the table. It is a good thing I came alone. Checked out on-line and after 24 hours still have not received my final bill.
40,Spa rooms are spacious and clean. Good variety of food options. Need to open up more elevators especially when we are supposed to be distancing only 2 elevators operational after a Raider game madness!
50,This 5 day stay was exceptional. Room was very nice and very clean. Many varied eating establishments from which to choose. Staff were knowledgeable friendly and courteous. Would highly recommend this M-Life property.
40,Good food. Great location nice people.working. small and cozy and I prefer that. 200 characters is a bit much for a review so I'm not sure how to give a review using that many words..hahaha but here we go. Will stay again. Last year at the Grand and that was just toooo big
10,Terrible service not a friendly place to stay. Rooms underwhelming with horrible service at restaurants which average an hour wait to be seated if at all. Charging for parking even for guests of the hotel really?
40,I've paid more for worse rooms on the strip. This is a good bet and the internal restaurants are very tasty. Had issue with parking which was frustrating but staff did resolve it.Staff was friendly overall and the room had a great view. Would buy again.
50,This hotel is smoke free a plus. Kept very clean. It has all the amenities the rooms are great many options for food. The pool area is awesome. Location location location. It is in the right location.
50,I truly enjoyed my stay at the Park MGM. The resort and rooms were clean. The non-smoking environment all throughout the resort was a game changer even in the casino! Good location and will be back again soon!
40,It was our first time staying at the Park MGM. After we figured out how to find the hotel parking it was great when we found out it was a smoke free casino too. The only bad part was there was not a big selection of table games and the minimums were high. The rooms were very nice but did not have a refrigerator for our meds. The atmosphere music was a little too loud especially in the restaurants so it was difficult to have a low volume conversation while we were eating. Other than that we will return some day because it’s a smoke free casino.
20,I was placed a handicapp room that I did not request. With the bed being so low I came back to sever back problems that kept me bed bound for a couple of days. Called to speak with a Manger I have not received a call back as of yet. It's been almost a week.
50,The location is excellent (next to t mobile arena) right in the middle of the strip where it’s poppin at. Cheap retailers close (Ross Marshall’s Burlington) if you need swimming attire. Denny’s close. Top notch customer service!
50,The boys and I go for a football weekend every year. We missed last years COVID year so this was a return trip after missing a year. Park MGM with their smoke free atmosphere is awesome. Everything went as planned. Easy checkin and checkout dealers giving us their best and the location was perfect.
50,The fact that this is a non smoking hotel alone would make me come back. But beyond that everything was so clean. My boyfriend loved the casino and the sports bar while I loved the pool. Will be back
50,I have stayed at this hotel over 350 nights. It is in a great location. It has changed since the Monte Carlo days. I have a lot of fun with the bar staff. Been hassling them for years. The now are friends. LALA Noodle is delicious. Pool is great.
40,Clean fresh hotel with incredible scent in the lobby - no smoke! Nighthawk suite was great with couch and large bathroom. Great service to resolve check in problems. Early check in must be requested and fee applies.
50,Had a great time. I always stay with MGM they are the best! They are so accommodating and go above and beyond to make your stay the best it can be. I always have such a great time when I stay at an MGM resort.
20,Stay somewhere else! We thought this location was great but it really wasn’t. People here were rude the room was dirty and for the price we paid so not worth it. We stayed here as a convenience to the venue we were attending however we had to walk farther to get to all other accommodations. We felt like the location was unsafe and was not equivalent to the price we paid.
40,Last time I was at this hotel is when it was the Monte Carlo. I can say that it has changed. A fresher more modern property. My room was on the 20th floor overlooking the three pools. It was a large room with a king size bed large built in sofa table chair large screen TV good size bathroom large walk in tiled shower vanity and magnifying mirror. It was clean and comfortable. The cleaning staff was very accommodating when asking for extra clean towels or toiletries. It was easy checking in and out of the hotel. Smoke free is a plus too! Never had to wait long to use the elevator. Everyone that I encountered there was very helpful and nice.
20,It seemed every time we speeded into an elevator it had some sort of trash inside. I understand it’s a busy hotel but to see trash nearly every time was annoying. Also my headboard base was disgusting. I don’t know what was splattered at the base. I just threw a towel over it to cover.
50,The staff at the Park MGM restored my faith in great customer service. The staff at the Park MGM take pride in their jobs and they really made me feel like I was important. The hotel had a laid back smooth atmosphere. I felt safe everyone wore their masks the room was clean and very comfortable with a nice view.
30,Dark hallways I like that the casino is smoke free but I guess everyone is smoking weed in the rooms and hallways and IT WILL get in your room! Window was extremely dirty on the outside couldn't take pictures through it. Dead bird (looks like it's been there for a while) right outside window.
30,Great location but the rooms were just ok. No dresser just some small drawers in a little closet. Beds were pretty comfortable. Hallways are dark and carpet really dirty. We love the Signature at MGM so we just expected more when we saw MGM in the title.
10,4 people each registered for individual packages for 2 nights with a $50 food and beverage credit for each day. I had to change my package after being billed incorrectly. And the other 3 only received 1 day credit. Staff seemed to be uninformed disinterested and irritated with inquiries. We spent a lot money. Terrible. Never again.
50,Me personally didn’t like Vegas because of the smell of cigarettes but this one atm doesn’t allow smoking. It was a good time and the staff was friendly check in was quick and checkout was even faster
20,bars closed in the evenings video porker machine turned off. $14.00 for a shot.... bartenders that were working were rude even after tipping. the only enjoyable part of the trip was the pool area and the people that worked there
40,When we initially started looking for hotels we were really considering the Aria because our friends were staying there. But after we saw the difference in price The Parks fit our budget perfectly. We were also very happy to confirm our choice after we visited the Aria and the Parks was most definitely the correct choice due to way the casino flowed.
50,Room was very small great location for travel to the t Mobil arena and other populated areas. All the pools close at 6pm I highly recommend downloading the app and skipping check in. It was amazing..
50,The non smoking rooms and casino were refreshing after being out to other properties. The room was very nice although a mini fridge would have been nice. The shower was the best I ha e ever had in a hotel room.
50,Courteous staff clean rooms great water pressure and air conditioning. Smokeless environment was awesome!! Not happy about the Mask Mandates but what else can they do? It will be nice when freedom of choice for private businesses returns to America.
50,I went for a solo trip for my birthday. The staff was friendly and the room was very clean. You working that you have a connecting location for the tram to Bellagio which saved a lot of walking. Would highly recommend especially because it is the only non-smoking casino.
50,Great place to stay. No smoking! (I hate cigarette smoke & the smell) Excellent places to eat. Try Eataly. Great Italian options. Room service breakfast was excellent. Staff all friendly. Bars & Restaurants were all good! Central location on strip in the middle of everything.
20,Nightingale suite Bathroom baseboards & shelving broken both TVs didn’t work. Loud banging noise throughout the night from maintenance room next door to suite. Housekeeping entering room even with signs on door for no service. When complaining to front desk rep was rude and showed no compassion for the issues stating there was no record of the complaints in the system and don’t expect any credit. And to take the housekeeping issues up with that dept. Also when booking the room was told there would be a bathtub and there was nothing of the sort.
40,Nice hotel. Smoke free was amazing but lacked some table games being closed and fewer older a lot machines. Overall good location and friendly staff. The pools are fine but nothing to rave home about.
40,The staff room and facilities were excellent. Our room was spacious and had an excellent view of the strip and surrounds. The pillows were a little stiff and took some getting used to. The pool area was nice and had two pools to choose from plus hot tubs.    The one flaw for us was the restaurants. We are not chefs or food snobs and found the menus hard to figure out what we were getting. Besides that the food was all way overpriced. We ended up eating at other MGM facilities or on the the strip.
50,Exceptional service by all employees food and food service was fantastic in all venues and stay was very nice clean and smoke free. Valet was very friendly and easy to in and out. Front desk service and Bell service very organized and friendly.
30,basic hotel room  nothing special about the room contained no extras  mini bar or refrig or water available for for free or purchase  had $50 credit was misleading the room service close at 2pm  the parking was never explain ..pay in and out fees daily
20,Came home with at least 10 bed bug bites. Didn’t know what they were at first. Had to wash all the clothing items in hot water and left everything outside in the hot sun for 2 days. Bought cortisone to help with the itching.
50,would stay there again super clean and love that it doesn't spell like smoke. everyone was helpful and nice will helpful and stay at any hotel that doesn't smoke. we where super great full that it didn't smoke
50,I can not say enough about the level of service at the spa. The entire staff was kind and friendly.    The deep tissue massage provided by Sophia (might be spelled Saphia) was without question the best I have ever received.    Another member of my group had a massage by a different staff member and it also great.    I can not recommend enough. If you have a chance request Sophia (or Saphia).
10,Horrible check in experience. Room was unclean (A q-tip left on main carpet). Attention to detail was non existence and I didn't feel like I mattered as a customer! No follow up from staff! While the non smoking aspect is great and the pool area was nice that is really the only positive aspects of this hotel. Very disappointed!
40,Overall my stay was great! Service was excellent. Mobile services were running smooth; easy mobile check in/out mobile key worked every time. I loved the decor it was classy industrial minimalist. The room was spacious and clean the bed was super cozy and snug. The couch inside the room was bigger than usual and very comfortable. Lots of food options in and around the hotel. Betty's grill was on point for a quick bite after a few drinks ;) Pool was great a combination of adult chic and relaxation. The only thing that was missing for me was a small fridge in the room. The hotel is a bit far from the middle of the strip but getting a rideshare was really quick and easy. Thank you Park MGM for another successful Vegas Trip!
40,Overall pretty good except for some unfortunate circumstances involving staff interaction.  Areas of concern:  Front desk restaurants and bars. Better training needed. Especially on customer interaction and reaction
50,They have the best beds  you can sleep like a baby  nice and clean place  if you want coffee go to the food court less line and the bakery is fantastic Don’t buy the pasta there  we did’t not like it …But the coffees Lavazza …
10,Rooms were uncomfortably hot. Had to be transferred to a different room. That room was also hot. We also booked a cabana but the pool got closed because of a rain storm. We received no refund no resort credit.
50,It was a nice trip friendly staff clean room fast check in the only thing that we didn't like was that the pool closed at 6 pm so we never ended up having Time to use it other than that everything was very nice
20,Dark rooms with worn out furniture peeling wallpaper and stained lampshades. Non-smoking is great but that’s about it’s only appeal. Eataly is nice but expensive and good food can be found all over the strip. I’d skip Park.
10,What I said above ^^^ no room service and MGM has very limited places open pay and staff the hotel or close it down for ever it was a horrible experience when I come back to Las Vegas I will be at the Four Seasons
50,Super easy online check-in and check-out. The room had simple nice decor and was clean. We stayed with our 2 young children and there was plenty of space for our things and for them to play. Also love the smoke free environment so we could walk through the casino floor without worrying about the kiddos. 10/10 recommend.
20,Dirty couch with white stains that look gross dirty white sheets. Customer service was not so good. House keeping took about 6 hours to bring my extra pillow and towels. I guess snacks were moved but not taken and they charge us for it. Checking in was long and tiring. Next time I will do mobile check in and not book a room here.
50,We loved The Park MGM! The staff were very friendly and helpful. The queen double room was exceptionally clean the water pressure in the shower was powerful. Requested housekeeping can opt out for our entire stay and were very pleased. The restaurants were terrific and the tram was an added benefit! We will stay here again.
40,Had a great time with many siblings that I recommended to stay at Park MGM most of them live in Southern California We traveled from Fresno it was a good weekendeveryone was pleased to stay at this Hotel and would definitely come back!
50,Excellent room and service very friendly staff really enjoyed the casino part dealers are really friendly and always welcomed honestly couldn't ask for something better love it all the way it is definitely going to see me come back.
50,Property was clean friendly staff and we loved Eatily. Great selection of restaurants and bars. Dealers were friendly and tables were good. We plan on booking at the Park for our next trip to Las Vegas.
50,another trip in the books to validate that booking at one of the MGM properties is the way to go. From the service received to the location and numerous options available around you why would you book anywhere else?!!
20,Not good just so so didn’t like room layout tv needs to face bed. No fridge. Rooms are dark. Hallways are dark. Towels had holes and are worn out. Pools are ok. Didn’t provide WiFi. Used 50 bucks resort credit at arias salt and ivy which was even more horrible don’t recommend park mgm at all. Only stayed here because comped 3 nights but had to pay 130 bucks resort fee. But not worth it IMO
10,The room was out dated I was expecting more from the inside bc the hotel outer exterior was beautiful but the bathroom had a great amount of mildew. I have stay at all mgm properties except the park and I wish I didn’t.
50,The renovated rooms are nice. Everyone who in interacted with was pleasant and knowledgeable - From housekeeping to the bell staff to the front desk and personnel in the casino. Love the non smoking casino and the hotel.
50,This hotel checked all the boxes...great location clean rooms that were completely smoke free and quiet! I picked this because of the price and was expecting a much lower grade hotel. It was top notch for an amazing price. Try it you won't be disappointed!
10,I was very disappointed with the new park I have stood there many times when it was called the Monte Carlo and I was always satisfied when in thinking that I was going to be satisfied and walked out very unhappy.
40,This place would have been perfect if it wasn’t for the issues with the key cards to access my room or the lousy service at prime rose it took us half an hour and se our waitress once the whole time didn’t see her again and took forever to get the check
40,Another great stay at Park Mgm perfect location and smoke free easy parking and check in. wish they had a 24 hour café but still my favorite place to stay. Has easily accessible tram from back of hotel to Bellagio so you don't have to make the horrible walk past city center
50,We stayed here for an anniversary weekend and it was amazing. The lady at the front desk who checked us in was pleasent and friendly. Our room had a strip view and it was a stay well room Wich was worth it! The whole property was smoke free and it was amazing!
10,Make sure when getting into your room that the safe is open so you can lock your valuables. If not call the front desk so they come open it I learned the hard way. Me and my boyfriend were robbed by the maid for $3200.00. We had the DO NOT DISTURB sign on the door and security told us the maid entered the room and was in there for a minute to a minute 1/2. Basically they could not do anything but make a report and would only get our money back if she fesses up!!! I bet she doesn't show up for her next shift!!! To make matters even worse they didn't even offer to comp the room or at least invite us back for a free visit....just terrible and sick to my stomach
30,They overbooked the hotel and offered no compensation to fix the issue that they had control over. Even when they had the sister hotel Nomad right there and still didn't try to accommodate me or the problem.
40,Great smoke free hotel without the crowds like in the larger hotels. Room and bathroom were both clean and spacious. Free tram to Bellagio and the monorail can be accessed across the street at MGM Grand. Only problem was at check in. The room type we booked was not available at check in. We accepted a different room but the view was awful. Would have been nice to have been offered an upgrade. Other than that we would definitely stay there again and highly recommend.
30,I usually like Park MGM-great location value and service. This past trip the front desk (unfriendly unenergetic) and casino hosts (severely inaccurate rating of my play) really soured my experience.
50,Came to Vegas for a couple of concerts and wanted a hotel where I would be able to relax but also be near the concert venues. Park MGM did not disappoint. It is very clean starting from the lobby all the way to the rooms? Staff is super friendly and the fact is a non-smoking casino is a real bonus. Did kind of wish they would up hold the mask policy a little more as there was quite a few of guest that did not have their masks on and walking past employees and no one would tell the guests to put their masks on! either have a mask policy of not but have the staff make sure it is being followed by all guests!
50,You're always treated like you're the most important guest there at all hours by everyone of the staff regardless of the department they work in. Smoke free!!! Large variety of table games and slots. Wonderful food options.
50,We had a wonderful experience at Park MGM. The hotel is completely non-smoking which I enjoy. There’s more of a chill atmosohere and really enjoy that. We would definitely stay there again when returning to Vegas!
40,sportsbook shouldnt have a live dj during the games. the sheets in one of the two rooms i got had some stains on them those should be thrown out. other than that the rooms were nice and clean location was great and the food was excellent.
50,My husband and I were very happy with our stay. The staff were friendly and helpful and the room was clean and well-designed. The bed was soft and cozy (but firm enough to provide good support). We especially loved the roomy shower with great water pressure. The entire place being non-smoking was a huge bonus.    Our AC worked well when we were in the room but if we were out all day and returned it would be stuffy and warm. We figured out that the AC has a motion detector. I would wake up in the middle of the night when the room was starting to warm up and wave my hand near the control panel and it would kick back on. Also the temperature gauge is inaccurate. It would generally read 5-8 degrees lower than the actual temp of the room.    Aside from the AC trickery my only other complaint is the lack of a coffee maker which has always been included in every other hotel room we've stayed in until now. I don't know if most of the other hotels in the area have them or not as this was my first stay in Vegas but I know my friends staying in the Bellagio had coffee makers.
10,"This is possibly the worst hotel I've visited in the last 10 years. Lots of problems:    * 25-minute wait in the check-in line    * Room smelled like cigarettes    * No room service at dinner time -- only 7 am-2 pm!    * Hotel has nearly 3000 rooms. I've seen bigger fitness centers at properties with 100-200 rooms.    * No coffee-makers in the rooms! Seriously? Motel 6 and Holiday inn have coffee makers. The line for the one coffee place in the hotel was 45 minutes long. Do you really want to start your morning like that?    * I could not get AC to work properly. Whatever temperature I set it at it would not go below 75.    * Half the restaurants were closed. The only place to go was ""Eataly"" which is a really pathetic Vegas take on Italian dining. I paid $27 for two slices of pizza that were apparently made early in the morning and then reheated. They were so dry they were almost inedible."
40,Checking in was great; Miko took care of us. Despite good basic decor with random photographs adorning the walls basic toilet cleanliness was lacking. I apparently sat on a dirty toilet. Much to my chagrin my husband regretfully informed me that there was remnants of explosive diarrhea underneath the toilet seat. I was left with no choice but to hope into the shower to decontaminate.
20,The hotel was OK it's nothing like the Signature at MGM or other MGM properties I have stayed at in the past. I will do not intend to book at Park MGM again in the future it'd have to be an absolute bargain for me to return.
10,Void staying at this property if you can help it. The pricing is fine but the customer service rooms and inaccuracy of delivery of information is not worth the money spent. I could have stayed at another property than to go through what I did especially with a coupled I brought to celebrate their birthdays and has never been to Vegas. Such a rip off and embarrassing.
30,Lobby was beautiful and so was everything else on first floor. The rooms are not that great and had musty smell. Could definitely find a hotel with nicer rooms for the same price. Restaurants are great!
50,During our stay we found the facility to be clean and smoke free which we loved. The staff were courteous and the new contact free process made us feel safe traveling during COVID. The conference rooms were clean everyone wore masks and seats were adequately spaced. Thank you!
10,Beds are uncomfortable rooms are not properly cleaned rooms stink room service was cold and too expensive for the quality of food I called the front desk to ask about getting moved to a different MGM hotel due to the multiple issues we had in the first day and having to move rooms 3 times! I was transferred to someone was not told who and had to leave a message. I still have not received a call back 3 days later and now that my vacation is over.
50,Loved it! The view was beautiful. The staff was helpful and friendly. The room was clean and spacious. The casino was fun. We were celebrating our 20th Wedding Anniversary and loved the entire experience.
50,There was no cigarette smoke at casino level also rooms were quite renovated and nice. Also it was quite silent inside my room I appreciate that a lot. Silent air conditioning. Best hotel I was staying at Strip so far.
30,"It's smoke-free the layout feels fresh and different and the alcove-style rooms are charming. The location isn't perfect (it's a bit too south on the strip) but you have some solid on-site properties (Eataly and Crack Shack) plus easy accessibility to a bunch of useful stores and restaurants.    The property's lighting and decor won't be for everyone but I liked it - everything felt ""nice"" for a mid-tier Vegas property. The pool area is fairly small but it still has a quality feel.    The gym is also solid. It's a bit cramped but it has dumbbells up to 100 and an actual free rack with a barbell - as opposed to the lame Smith Machines that are standard in most Vegas properties. Could use a few more plates (there's only enough to go to 340) but it's fine for a hotel gym.    However I did run into a few issues that put a damper on my stay:    *Check-in issue: As a gold Mlife member I'm entitled to a complimentary room upgrade. My understanding is that this doesn't quite bump you up to a suite but rather to a Stay Well and/or Strip View room on a higher floor. However when I checked in I was told that there were ""no upgraded rooms available"" even though I had called the day prior to confirm my upgrade and got there at like 11:30AM (sufficiently early to ensure there was no conceivable way every room could have been taken).    After arguing with a casino host I eventually got them to secure an upgraded room for me. It wasn't the best (not the top floor not the best view) but it was something. However it begs the question - why did I have to argue to get a room to which I was entitled? Clearly this room was ""available"" (not to mention the hotel wasn't even close to capacity for most of my stay so I wasn't buying that argument at all). Honestly left a sour taste in my mouth - which shouldn't be the case for a gold player (meaning - I gamble a lot!) who was staying for 8 days (meaning - I should be a priority for a great room!).    *Housekeeping issue: As is increasingly (and bizarrely) becoming the norm in the business housekeeping wants to make its rounds as early as 9AM. Since I was working east coast hours while here I needed to be in my room until 2PM (9AM feels early even if you're not working - as I'd imagine you'd be sleeping off your Vegas hangover). But as soon as I was free I would remove the Do Not Disturb sign - often when there was still a housekeeping attendant on my floor (meaning someone to see that my room was now free to clean). Despite establishing that pattern housekeeping only twice (in over a week) automatically cleaned my room. In the other cases I had to request service.    That admittedly wasn't a huge inconvenience in general but it became a problem one day. Even though my Do Not Disturb had been off most of the day (it was a weekend and I was out at the gym + pool + restaurant + casino) no one cleaned my room. I called to request service at about 8PM and was told ""housekeeping stops at 7PM."" I've stayed all over Vegas and travel for work and I've never once encountered a hotel - even a freaking Days Inn on the side of the highway - that doesn't offer 24 hour housekeeping. Especially when they errantly didn't clean your room!    I am hoping Park will reach out to me to apologize and arrange some complimentary stays but for the time being the customer service here was a black mark on an otherwise-fine stay."
40,Love the eateries downstairs. I like the ease of getting around the hotel as a guest the elevators check in desks and exit to Valet parking are all in the same general area. Also the pool exit is near so you don't have to walk thru the whole casino to get in and out of the hotel.
40,I had an issue with my player card I mentioned that in the other window. Other than that it was a great stay. I will stay again at the property it was a great location. I was shocked how easy it was to use the self check in.
50,We highly recommend this hotel! The rooms (and hallways) are very clean and comfortable. There are many restaurants to choose from and the location is superb! Close to shopping and many other attractions.
20,Beautifully designed for the people who love to see all of Vegas strip. Clean air all throughout the casino is smoke free. Only problem I encounter was that the room I was given had a issue with the restrooms so had to change hotel room two more times after that to finally have a proper working restroom
50,Really enjoyed my experience here. First time at Park MGM. I enjoy the other MGM properties but this one was a top rate experience at an affordable price. Smoke-free casino was a big plus! Also really enjoyed the Eately food court.
30,This hotel was definitely below par. Noisy neighbors up at all hours and clearly smoking weed in a non smoking hotel. I paid extra for the sleep well upgrade but the room wasn’t very nice. It looked like an old hotel with new blinds and paint. Unfortunately I don’t think I’ll be coming back.
50,During corona times non smoking hotels are the best choice for both smokers and non smokers. Stay healthy stay safe have fun nice pool friendly staff high level of sanitization masks are free and available near elevators or near check in point.
50,We booked a room here using a reward through the myVegas app and felt like we picked really good accommodations for the price. Park MGM opened just one year ago after remodeling from what used to be the Monte Carlo. The rooms aren't huge and glamorous but they clean modern and have all the basic necessities. The location is pretty central and takes about half an hour to walk to Cesar's Palace. My favorite things about this hotel: location smoke-free and pet friendly. I would come back to this hotel solely for the smoke-free experience!
50,We had an Amazing time at Park MGM. Being Non Smoking was paramount for our health. Everywhere we went throughout the Hotel and Casino we felt comfortable and open. Staff was always extremely friendly helpful with a smile. Tram to Bellagio and the Breezeway to cross LV Blvd made getting around super easy. We will definitely come again! next time with our 2 year old granddaughter and Foster Son to enjoy the pool and not worry about 2nd hand smoke
50,It's nice not to be overwhelmed by the smell of smoke as soon as you walk in the door. Our room didn't have a refrigerator which was a bummer but it was fine. Staff was helpful and Bavette's Steakhouse in the casino was delicious!
50,We switched hotels from the OYO to the park after seeing the horrible room we had at the OYO. The entire weekend all I kept saying was how great the hotel was after we switched. Bonus was non smoking!
40,Love the non smoking casino is small but it’s easy to navigate and eatly is great addition for food and experience juniper lounge was awesome - Primrose had a great breakfast - location is great as you walk to the miracle mile shops in 10 minutes or use the free tram to Aria. You are steps from NYNY which gives you easy access to MGM and Excalibur- the pool is nice nothing special but it’s quiet and the frozen drinks were good.
50,Great location with easy access to other MGM properties. The Eataly had so many options including Gluten Free items. Nice size casino but not too big. THe property was well maintained. The ability to do self checkin and also print our puente room keys worked well.
30,Rooms comfortable but not my style aesthetically. Room on 4th floor dark due to a concrete wall outside of window. Beds comfortable and nice shower. Did mobile check in and it was great and love that the property is non smoking.    Seems there were limited cocktail waitresses. Waited 20 minutes and couldn’t get a coffee while playing roulette one morning. My husband asked another staff and the response was “ is there a long line at Starbucks?” Ended up leaving to go to Dunkin Donuts to get a coffee and wound up giving our money to Caesar’s Palace that day. We had to leave to get coffee so we figured we might as well try another casino.    Overall comfortable but I didn’t care for the overall decor and nothing really wowed me.
50,The hotel was amazing. Staff was friendly and courteous. Hotel was clean and immaculate. All measures were taken to ensure our safety during Covid-19. Staff was very friendly and attentive. Dining options were superb. We were treated very well during our stay.
30,The rooms are clean but nothing special. I was on the 9th floor and could hear music 24/7. There are not a good selection of food places inside Park so you’ll have ti venture out. Security is a bit overzealous. Rewards desk staff is the best! The younger crowd in the casino can be a bit unruly.
50,What a great trip! My room was very clean and comfy cozy! I love how it was set up because when you're tired of walking the strip you can relax in your room with friends and family. There was plenty of room to entertain.
50,Park MGM is a fun hotel. It offers a lot of delicious and diverse food options; from upscale dining to a delightful brunch at Primrose to a quick gourmet pizza at Eataly - which is an awesome place to explore anything and everything authentically food-related from Italy. The hotel and casino aren't too big it felt very easy to get around. And the pools were very nice. All of the staff members we came into contact with were very friendly and helpful. We also enjoyed the Starbucks just outside of the hotel room elevators.
40,The Park is in a good location and one of few hotels with updated rooms. The casino is very clean and nonsmoking much better than others. All staff were friendly and helpful. The three pool areas provide a lot of space with excellent poolside food and service
20,There was heavy duty renovation work every morning for 3 days of my trip. When I spoke to the front desk the receptionist failed to apologize even though I stated that the work started at 8am every morning. We were not told about this maintenance work and the hotel worker seemed to be bothered to even appolozige or offer a solution or discount on our stay. Unfortunately the work was right outside my hotel room and was extremely loud due to power tools and workers cutting and sawing into the wall to the room next to ours. I understand that work needs to be done for repairs but this was extremely unprofessional. If the hotel worker would have offered to refund part of the stay and been sincere I would have accepted the solution and understood. However next time I travel I will likely not stay at the Park MGM again.
20,The casino staff was very unfriendly and short with us especially one pit boss at the blackjack tables that was very rude. I’d gamble elsewhere.    Rooms are decent for the price and the rest of the staff did a pretty good job.
50,I loved this property for several other reasons but smoke-free sold me. The room was beautiful and staff provided great customer service. I will stay here in the future. The restaurants are nice and I loved La La Noodle and highly recommend it. Food was great and customer service was very friendly.
50,This place has the best restaurants and is super close to everything on the strip. Check in was super fast and easy. Security was really good about enforcing masks and everything seemed clean. The only downside to this place is that the rooms have really low ceilings and do not have a mini fridge. Overall great place to stay and would stay here again. Definitely recommend staying here and eating at the restaurants.
40,Great place to stay with non-smoking Hotel & Casino. Loved not smelling like smoke as you do at other Las Vegas Hotel & Casino. Rooms are clean and commutable. Has nice places to eat and pools. Wish rooms had coffee maker and refrigerators & small dresser with drawers to place some clothing. My biggest issue was the bed being very low to the ground making it very hard to get up from especially if I had to get up in the middle of the night (being disabled tis was very hard).
30,My husband & I recently stayed 3 nights at the Park MGM as part of a package booked through Costco.    Positives: Very reasonable rate convenient location plenty of dining choices friendly staff & entertainment options room service & MAID SERVICE!! (Hard to find these days)    Negatives: Room was very basic no mini fridge microwave coffee pot ice bucket or cups.    The casino was clean with a variety of tables & machines all participating with your M Life player card. There were also several shops for drinks snacks & sundries. Valet parking is available at a steep $36 a night.    Not our favorite M Life property but a convenient clean stay for sure!
50,Overall the hotel room and staff was great. We were extremely happy with the nonsmoking atmosphere. Our gambling experience was fun the food & drinks were great and the desserts were amazing. We will make this one of our spots!
50,We have been staying here since 2002 (The old Monte Carlo day's). Great staff always made us feel at home. We love the Nighthawk suite. Casino is very pleasant not real noisey. Many great food choices for dinner.
50,The casino is in a great location! Central to the strip and easy to get to other properties. Casino is smoke free which is a welcome change! Nice pool area. Casino staff and bartenders are all very friendly!
50,Everytime I stay at the Park MGM it never fails to deliver. From the red decor plush bedding and great views. It couldn't get any better. This is my favorite none expensive but not cheap hotel on the strip.
50,This hotel is in a perfect location. Near the monorail that can take you all the way to Sahara. We had a great time here. The rooms are clean and big. Checking in was fast and they were nice. We would come back .
40,Very good stay. Rooms are fresh. Shower was sizeable. Room was quiet. The Hotel/Casino being no-smoking is a dream! So nice not to be in a smoky casino.    My only issue is check-in is unacceptably slow. Las Vegas hotels need to find a way to speed up the check-in process. It's entirely too chaotic and slow. For check-out I tried the self-checkout kiosk. Neither of the two I tried were functioning properly. I was left in the lurch. Wait in the long line to deal with an agent (I wasn't willing to wait) or just drop the key in the key-drop box (which I did). I was left with the unknown of whether I was checked-out properly or not.    Neither my check-in or check-out experience was good but my overall stay was very good anyway.
50,We traveled to Park MGM for an event that we ended up not attending due to Vivid seats messing up our tickets. The hotel and staff were great and we enjoyed our time there anyway. I would definitely stay there again. Great location!!
50,Andres Ramirez came to our room to fix an issue we were having with our tv. What an amazing man! He was knowledgeable and one of the friendliest people out here. He mentioned that he was in the service. I am honored to have someone as great as him representing our country.
50,The room was nice. It was a typical hotel room. The shower was spacious and great water pressure. The bed was fairly comfortable. Long couch in front of the window. We did not have a fridge so that would have been nice. Plenty of outlets and places to charge electronics. Convenient hookups for media to the tv. We were on the 13th floor and had a good view of New York New York T-Mobile Arena Plaza and the south side of the strip.
40,My stay here was pretty good. My only issue was the television not working very well and the cleaning crew forgot my wash cloths twice. I had to call the front desk twice to get the wash cloths. Pretty good overall.
50,"I've spent over 350 nights in Las Vegas hotels over the past 20+ years and this trip was exceptional.  After a nightmare experience at their ""5 star"" competitor which resulted in cancelling our stay we booked seamlessly into The Park at 11pm on a Friday into a holiday weekend.    The service was impeccable the room was perfect a 2 queen suite with 2 couches one that pulled out into a bed and a dining table near the elevator with a great view of the strip. I've stayed in nearly every strip casino and many off strip and this is easily one of the best layouts of a room in regards to family staying especially for the price point! The restaurants are top tier we ate at both ""Best Friend"" and ""Eataly"" on this trip and it was just as excellent as it has been on previous trips. The added perk of non-smoking throughout the casino added more value as a family destination. We spent Sunday at the pool There are 3 of them in a well designed area that allows for water in both sun and shade and we found lounge chairs without issue. Every member of the staff we encountered was friendly and gave off very good vibes as they actually enjoyed their jobs.  Really gets a top recommendation!    Finally this is a great location if you're planning on attending an event at t-mobile arena I've done several in the past while staying at The Park and it's very convenient."
20,There is no reason to spend this much money to stay here. The kiosk check in takes your information and you need to make an account. Also myself and other guests had no idea how to work the check in kiosk well enough without staff help so it begs the question why even have a kiosk if you need staff help. Check out was easier. There are no amenities in the room. The walls don’t look they they’ve been cleaned and the bed is just one blanket. It is a very minimal room yet it cost $300+ for one night (nightingale room). Also parking is NOT free even if you are hotel guest which is absolutely ridiculous given the fact that they don’t make parking and picking up your car easy.
50,Great place to stay if you’re in Vegas. It’s clean and very nice. Also enjoyed that it is non smoking. Proximity to strip is also great but quiet. Restaurants on site were great as well. Would definitely recommend!
40,Great hotel nice location never to busy and pretty clean compared to others. Only problem is the crazy resort fees and having to pay for parking as a guest staying there which makes no sense. Other then that pretty great place to stay
50,Very Convenient location. It has tram to Bellagio. The restaurants have great selections of food. I like that there are attendants who can assist at the parking garage. I’m new to digital keys etc. that was the only trouble I had during my stay.
50,Beautiful atmosphere great customer service very clean establishment. It made you feel as if you were always taken care of. Great place to relax and enjoy all that vegas has to offer. Will definitely be back!!
50,This is the best hotel room I have ever had anywhere not just in Las Vegas. Not huge but big and full of amenities. I can't remember the last time I had a multi night stay and didn't have to request anything.  Not all the MGM properties give world class customer service - the Park MGM definitely does.
50,The employees at Park MGM made me feel very Special and treated me like Royalty ❤️ My siblings were quite pleased with our room and other hotel accommodations. I am personally planning another Vegas trip and my lodging will definitely be right back at The Park MGM and since Bruno Mars has residency there I’m going to do my darndest to try and get tickets 🎫 for one of his shows there at the The Park MGM🥰
50,Very clean. Smartly decorated. Very helpful friendly staff. Good restaurants with excellent service. Room very comfortable. Pool and workout room were clean and inviting. Great location within walking distance to many hotels
50,After getting back to our room the first night we realized that our air was not cooling the entire room. Andres was sent up and was able to resolve the issue within minutes. He was pleasant and very knowledgeable about the area.
50,This hotel is close to everything and also has a no smoking policy in the entire hotel. Perfect for those who do not smoke. Good rate and great food options. I would definitely stay here again and recommend to everyone
40,I love that this hotel is non smoking. The Eataly place is really awesome! the staff is very helpful and friendly. I also loved the courtyard to New York New York which is a nice place to hang out. Would recommend this place to all families and friends.
50,Enjoyed the stay but had problems redeeming Mlife rewards. Had to pay full price because the rewards tickets were already given out all 6 tickets. If you only give 6 tickets a day the rewards are useless.
50,As a long time Vegas visitor I have finally found a property that is completely non smoking! I love Vegas I have always dreaded being surrounded by smokers and feeling like I have to burn my clothes at the end of the trip. I would highly recommend staying at the Park MGM.
40,Great location. Clean and smells fresh. Friendly staff. Convenient parking. Everything is great about this hotel besides pillows and mattress. I don't get a Goodnight rest at this hotel due to very bad quality of pillows and their mattress. Hope they will do something about it.
10,Have you ever wanted to sleep on a bed filled with dog hair? Or grab a towel from the bathroom with a booger and a different one with a fresh blood stain? What about a front desk agent you have to tell him how to do his job? Better yet an unfriendly cashier before coffee? Well this is the place for you. Other than one staff member in housekeeping making my day by being kind caring and taking pride in her job I would have jumped in my truck and say screw if I’m driving back to L.A after an 8 hour road trip to Vegas. But seriously don’t let the nice outside building fool you.
40,I was highly impressed with the staff. They were very kind and helpful! The room was small and did not have a fridge. I didn’t really think to ask though-so it may have been my fault. Also-the room temperature was either too hot or too cold. It made sleep difficult. Primrose is excellent and the pools were great!
30,Great hotel with one minor and one major issue. The minor issue was that the water pressure in the showers was subpar. Serviceable but not great. The major issue was the noise. I was on the fourth floor and in the mornings between around 8-9 am there was perpetual noise coming from what appeared to be the third floor. It was a constant banging that managed that overpower even the white noise I play to block noises out when traveling. I'm not sure if it was construction or a part of regular operations; I'm honestly not sure what in the world the noise was.
50,Great food atmosphere prime Las Vegas strip location clean rooms friendly staff Primrose brunch restaurant is a must 4 pools with music activities and a poolside taco bar. Directly across the street from the T -Mobile arena and also this place is family friendly.
50,I knew this was going to be a great stay when we arrived early and were able to check in at 10am! We booked a daybed at the pool and had so much fun! All the staff from the front desk to concierge housekeeping pool server and Primrose restaurant server gave 5 star quality. The Casino personnel were OK but everyone else was superb!
40,Fantastic client services and cleaning staff. We were greeted at the front desk by a friendly attendant that was able to make our initial experience welcoming. We loved the pools and the various options for upscale or easy eats ! Try out eataly and bestfriend !
30,When we arrived we asked for water at check in the person at the desk asked us to wait while she went to get us some. After about ten minutes she came back and said she couldn’t find any water. Yet in the casino if you ask a waitress she will give you some water. The room did not have a coffee pot coffee nor a microwave. It has been many years since we have stayed in a hotel/motel that didn’t have a coffee pot nor microwave. It seems that they only want to sell unless you are contributing to the casino.
10,I found a very large size used dirty man’s boxer inside my hotel room bed it was disgusting and unacceptable when I paid $500 for it! I called the manager and she didn’t want to do anything about it is this normal ?
50,We had the Nighthawk Suite. It's the first time we've had a hotel room with a walk-in closet. The bed was very comfortable as were the pillows. The shower had dual showerheads and plenty of pressure. The only negative was the lack of an available coffee pot. The Borgata still furnishes them but the Vegas casinos seem to think Covid can survive boiling water.
50,Our third visit….wow what a positive change. The staff was exceptional starting at Valet. We checked in on the app which was super easy. Our room was meticulously cleaned. Every member of Park MGM was helpful and friendly going above and beyond to help us. A very nice visit.
50,Our overall experience was exceptional. The room was clean comfortable and ready when we arrived. The staff was friendly and service was excellent. The entire facility is smoke free. The only smoke free casino I entered during my stay. My only complaint is there are no coffee makers in the room. It may seem like a very small convenience but it would have made our stay much more enjoyable.
30,"When I checked into the room I noticed a finger nail next to my bed meaning they do minimum cleaning. Park mgm gave me a $50 resort credit and when I went to check out they charged me for the crack shack. I informed them Crack shack at park mgm said it is covered by resort credit the only response I received from Park mgm was ""it happens a lot and we are not sure why they say it is"". They should take responsibility sense they have seen it a lot but they refused to refund me. I thought they would treat me a little better considering I am a gold member meaning I stay with them often but i guess being a loyal customer does not mean much these days."
30,Not very impressed with the room . Bed was uncomfortable and very low to the ground for a taller person like myself . House keeping took forever to answer the phone to provide us with some fresh towels
30,Rooms were clean but lacked basic amenities like drawers for storage. I was there for 5 nights but had nowhere to unpack. The small wardrobe had about 5/7 hangers in addition to the iron ironing board glasses and ice bucket. I really needed/wanted to unpack.
30,Several times the digital key failed to load preventing us from being able to use the eleevators or access our room. The rest of the hotel is awesome. But the digital key system is extremely frustrating to say the least
50,Always a great experience at the park Mgm. The not so hidden gem on the strip is smoke free easy to check in and out and central to everything you’d want to see in Vegas. Love the new York vibe of the rooms!
50,Stayed here for the weekend for a friends 21st birthday and had a pleasant stay. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Everything around Park MGM is close by such as the stores and restaurants. Would recommend staying here!
50,We were impressed with the rooms. We also ate at the noodle bar twice and the cafe twice. The layout of the casino is easy to learn. Very spacious! I recommend also trying the Italian Eatery there. My luck was ok but that's the luck of all the casinos.
30,We changed hotels from the Delano to Park MGM for one night. We were totally spoiled at Delano complex. Our room at park was very small and there was no a refrigerator. The plus side is it is right on the strip and close walking distance to everything. We had dinner in eataly which was amazing. I can’t put my finger on just why I didn’t love it.
50,Always wanted to try Park MGM and they offered me a low price and $50 a day. Location easy beds excellent AC superb view was what I demand (very improtant) bathroom/shower user friendly food and casino nice. My buddy has a bum knee so I dropped him off and picked him up at the front desk area which was very easy because self parking was a short distance away. Had 5th row center seats for fantastic Carrot Top show with plenty of elbow room (distancing). My buddy had luck and enjoyed the companionship of the bar gambling crowd because he was in the business I on the other hand played and lost quickly (don't use MGM card). They had just opened up Vegas and no masks were required and we both were fully vaxed but my convention was postponed from winter to June and I really don't like LV in the summer but the insides of LV and chilly and cool. All in all I give Park MGM a thumbs up. Been to LV 20 plus times and I save up for nice rooms with views shows with great seats and eateries that are famous for food/drink and atmosphere so I can go back home and brag. Going back in Jan/Feb so MGM I'm waiting for another perk see you guys in 140 days.
50,Absolutely great stay clean and convenient location. Hotel staff were professional knowledgeable and provided great entertainment recommendations. Will definitely stay here again and recommend to family and friends
40,Stayed here for a conference last month.    Room was adequate and clean. Nice view too.    The SHOWER in the bathroom is the bomb! Great pressure - and goes from burning hott to icy ice cold.    Food in the food-court is the most reasonable around but still $$    Would recommend: Yes  Would re-patronize: Yes
30,Park MGM is a good hotel the eatery is extraordinary the problem is this is the second time I have stayed there this month and my room was too hot like the air does not circulate or it’s not a consistent flow!
50,Excellent staff and environment. All were very friendly and helpful. Will stay here again.  Loved the Primrose breakfast but disappointed in the sports book area.  Loved the convenience store right by the elevator.  Thought they did an excellent job during a pandemic.
20,We stayed at the Park mgm. Rooms were old and nothing special. Checkin was a nightmare. We got the hotels confused and checked into mgm. They gave us a room key to a room already occupied! Yup. Our reservations weren't even at the hotel
50,Stayed here to celebrate my birthday. It was a great experience even with Bruno Mars being in concert that weekend. Service is great everything is clean and the Casino is SMOKE FREE!!! I recommend this hotel to everyone!
50,Had an enjoyable time staying at the PARK MGM. The check-in was so easy using the app. The casino staff was very friendly and helpful to new players. And there were excellent food choices provided by the hotel.
50,The rooms were very nice and very clean.  And love Eataly it’s amazing. The food is good. Top favorite was their steakhouse Bavette so nice and romantic definitely great for a date night. The staff is very friendly.
50,Great experience - non-smoking casino which is a huge improvement to the normal Vegas experience. Convenient to other hotels on the strip - great restaurants in the Park and the other MGM properties staff were all friendly and resolved issues immediately.
40,This trip was booked for my birthday to see Bruno Mars. Overall I enjoyed my stay at Park MGM. Pros: The restaurants are superb and concierge staff were helpful. Cons: I guess Bruno and his crew had all the face towels since we had to use the same one Thursday-Monday.
50,Amazing place to stay highly recommended! The fact that they had Eataly was a huge plus for me. Best Friend was really good too. Pool was nice and I went during the week so it wasn’t crowded. Overall a great place to stay when you’re in Vegas!
50,Fantastic room with nice views and a great bathroom. The Eataly restaurant was positively delicious. So many restaurants within a comfortable walking distance. The Concierges on staff were very helpful and friendly. Definitely a hotel we will happily come back to on our next visit !
50,Awesome job responded quickly and for our trouble gave us a voucher for dinner.  Love Park MGM. Everybody professional and friendly. Clean rooms well maintained pool is awesome. Would recommend anytime.
50,I love it very fun and very relaxing I hope to return next year the staff are very efficient and very attentive Park MGM is my hotel of choice since I was MonteCarlo I want to return with my whole family.
30,Ours is King size bed with strip view on the 24th floor. The room is smaller than we expected. The shower is way too small and faucets is aged. We were there just one night for Bruno Mars concert. The location is great !!
50,Park MGM is a no-smoking casino one of very few. Other casinos should learn that taking away smoking does not keep gamblers away. Park MGM rooms are very clean and spacious they have terrific food options and the casino is smoke-free. The best of everything!
10,The room was such a disappointment based on what our expectations were. For the price we paid we could have done so much better elsewhere. We had nothing but problems with the room including no air conditioning for two or our four days and a water loss in our room for several hours.
50,Park MGM is a fantastic place to stay! I love the whole stay! The Park is Awesome and the rooms are great to stay in. Some of Cityscape overlooks the pool area which gives a unique feel to the area. The Employees were helpful polite and just so nice to talk to! Thank you so much for a fun stay!
50,we always love to stay here. close to anything you need. everything in this area is a good time waiting to happen. good food good entertainment. close to shops and other casinos that are also fun to visit
50,We had a great stay at Park MGM. We loved the location of the hotel and really liked the fact the casino is smoke free. The room (and entire hotel/casino) was clean and staff was very friendly! We had a great brunch at Primrose the restaurant in the lobby. We would definitely stay here again!
50,This vacation stay in Las Vegas was due to the UFC 264 event which happened on 07/10/2021 at the T-Mobile Arena with a sold out crowd of over twenty-thousand people in attendance. The Park MGM hotel formerly known as the Monte Carlo had spacious rooms with very attentive customer service. The hotel was only across the street from the T-Mobile Arena which made it very convenient. Looking forward to staying at this property once again in the very near future.
20,Back corner room was dirty upon arrival. Used cups and garbage everywhere the front desk told me it was labeled ‘clean’… HA. Anyways it was cleaned after the phone call. At least the bed was made. The bottom half of the window’s view was that of the alley/loading dock. Which multiple times you could hear truck engines running whilst trying to sleep. Apart from that the window looked as if it never received a proper cleaning had a good layer of filth could barely get a good look of the strip. Should've tried getting some of the hotel costs taken off at least. Besides the room though the pool and casino floor was just fine but I won’t be returning.
50,Great place to stay in Las Vegas to stay great customer service. Had an AC problem and they sent a service engineer up right away and air was ice cold in no time. Beds were great bathroom a lil small but view was amazing cant wait to go back would stay here again.
50,Had wanted to stay here for a while but when we found out it there was no smoking allowed the decision was made. The staff the rooms and the restaurants are wonderful! We will be back for another round!
50,This is my favorite hotel in Las Vegas. Great central location terrific amenities my favorite shows have been in walking distance. The Park makes it easy to check in and out. Stress-free trips every time!
50,Very clean. I loved the shower and couch. I stayed at this hotel when it was the Monte Carlo. Park MGM did a great job on this renovation. The bed was really comfortable as well. I really liked that there were multiple electrical/charging outlets.
50,Had a wonderful time at the Park in June. We always make it a point to book here. The temp was around 100 degrees everyday. Wish there were more umbrellas available at the pool. Love this place the staff is terrific and the place is spotless. Great time.
20,I had stayed at this place many times when it was Monte Carlo. The last time I was here it was still a Monte Carlo but I was in a room that had already converted to Park MGM. We had a reunion of some sort with some friends I had not seen in 15+ years since college. I was excited to stay at Park MGM since it is a smoke free casino. I am allergic to cigarette smoke. The only places on the strip that seem to have good ventilation systems are 5-star hotels. This would be a good alternative option. Despite not very long lines it took forever to check in. The lines just moved very slowly and I am a M-Life Gold with a separate line from the general line. I combined two reservations for my stay. When I checked in I was told the two reservations are combined I would not have to come down again. Wrong. I did have to come down again and it was once again another long wait to get this done. This place needs more check in agents. It also needs better trained agents. When I was trying to get ready to head out my first night there I had no water to shower. I later found out there was a leak in a room near by and they shut all the water off. Anyways I hope they get it together. I know Covid has an impact on workers. But if you are no longer charging Covid prices then we should have expectations of decent services. Will I be back? Probably. again I love the smoke free concept and I love Eataly.
40,The willingness of Park MGM to go against the norm and make their establishment smoke-free was enough to entice us to try it out. The location is good the establishment was clean the bathroom was fabulous and the gaming choices were plentiful. We had read about thin walls but we either had the luck of the draw or the suite that we stayed in had thicker walls. We never heard any hallway noise. On the negative the guest room was pretty out-dated with its décor and the hallways were quite low. The bed was very hard so even with the quiet from the halls it was not the best sleep we have ever gotten. We tried out Bavette's steakhouse and found that to be a step above some of the others and would definitely return to eat there. Our biggest issue with Vegas right now is that it seems that Casinos are trying to recoup all their lost revenue through very tight machines. Its tough to want a return trip when losing was all we seemed to be able to do. This is an issue. As far as a return to Park MGM I wouldn't rule it out.
50,Excellent. Awesome. Best value in town 👌👏👍. Staff at check-in were kind friendly and very informative. Room was very nice 👌 clean good view . House keeping was very well done. Elevator were prompt. Dealer at craps table were positive friendly and seemed willing to give you advice on how to play.
50,"This was an ""all good"" trip as far as the hotel and it's facilities. The dining options both inside and within steps were all you could ask. Room was spacious had a nice view and most of all it was very clean."
50,Love this resort...smoke free is so important. Would really love a 4 card table or two. We have to go to other MGM resorts for 4 card. You really need more variety of restaurants. Everyone that we had contact with was just so helpful and friendly.
40,"Our overall view of the ""new"" Park MGM is a positive one and we will return. We did find the hallways of the room floors to be more dim then we preferred however the room itself was nice and clean. The other primary positive for us was every staff member we came across was exceedingly pleasant. Definitely one of the better MGM resort hotels on the strip - and we've stayed at most of them."
40,The hotel is a nice resort but it can use more live music in the casino area. NYNY has massive food music and fun options. The casino was bland and I am no fan of Eataly. We ate at America as there is nothing comparable to America.
50,Great hotel that is easily navigatable and provides all the gaming dining and resort amenities that the much larger hotels offer. Location is closest to the new arena. Non smoking was great aspect of this hotel.
50,This was the easiest mobile checkin experience on the Strip with no issues. I’ve stayed at all the MGM properties and this is the only one where I didn’t have to deal with checkin issues. Bypassing the checkin counter line was amazing and my room was ready hours early! Rooms are no frills but clean. The updating from the Monte Carlo to the Park MGM isn’t much but new paint and carpeting & new artwork in the rooms but it’s fine. The hallways seem depressing though- lighting needs updating to feel more park like bright and inviting but they’re just hallways I guess. The casino is clean staff is friendly and it’s the only one I’ve won money in for months. Can’t wait until their inside small venue opens up. Haus of Gaga inside is a neat little experience when it’s open but that’s a separate review. Having Eataly is a nice edition to bring foot traffic into this property with decent prices for meals. Love the smoke-free environment literal breath of fresh air after walking through other properties. Instant favorite.
50,Clean affordable and good location. I will be staying here again! Mobile check in/out was very easy to use! I enjoyed the food options and my time spent in the pool. Wish the slots payed out a little better!
50,Room was clean and well-amenitied.    The hotel itself had a very down-to-earth/refreshing feel to it sadly I didn't get a chance to eat at any restaurants there during my stay.    Love the non-smoke policy it enhanced our stay quite a bit.
50,We celebrated our 15 year wedding / 18 year together anniversary....our very first trip together was at Luxor Las Vegas back in 2003. When we heard the Park MGM was smoke free....that was plus #1!  Overall was a nice place...pools were great....gym was just right & service was good too. Rooms were a good size & we loved the boutique style and sofa. Would recommend.
50,This is a great hotel and the staff is wonderful always a smile on their face this is one of the only non-smoking hotel and casinos on the strip I love it I love everything about it and it has a Eataly on premises
50,So happy it's smoke-free! Mobile check in was super easy and skipped the lobby mess using Mobile key. Didn't request early check-in to avoid a fee but guessing because I did Mobile check-in room was ready by 11am at no charge awesome!    Room was super clean and love the modern take on roaring twenties style. The large sitting area was a plus. Room gets super dark. Bed was very comfortable. Restaurants here are so good. Love the pool area chill euro resort style instead of the constant crazy party loud Vegas vibe (which you need to recharge from sometimes). Staff on casino floor (Sean?) and at tables were so fun and friendly. Sox in lobby and bell desk offered great directions. Staff at LaLa Noodle were incredibly kind and helpful and the chef team there made such a tasty meal. Loved Park MGM and so did my friends. Definitely will be back.
40,Moved up the MGM Ladder this year. Historically I stay at MGM's LUXOR or NYNY properties. This year our Golf outing and alumni events were held out of PARK MGM. I was pleased with the renovations done to the old Monte Carlo. Rooms were immaculate and comfortable. The staff were professional courteous and kind. The dinning facilities are excellent. High praise to the offerings located at the open forum food court of EATERLY. I will be staying here again on my future annual VEGAS outing!
30,I've stayed at the Park MGM before and had the opportunity to get a comp room and stayed there again recently. The location of the Park is great easy to get to so many things without much effort. The Casino isn't the best but it's got enough to keep you busy for a while the food choices are ok Eataly is something that works for all As well as the other choices in house.  The room was clean and had two comfy beds that were completely adequate for our stay. So why the 3 then? There is something in the rooms at the Park that turns off the air conditioning if there isn't any movement. Both my son and I woke up in a sweat at night as the air would turn off. If you waved your hand it would turn on again but I want to sleep no move around to keep the air on. Maybe in colder months this might be ok but in Late June Air conditioning is mandatory. I went to another hotel after the Park two actually. Both of them had constant air conditioning and a good nights sleep. I have told the hotel but have not heard back. I'll probably not stay there again.
30,The only thing that wasn’t average was that we were upgraded rooms but someone had stuck the stripper cards they hand out on the street & stuck them to the art in our room. All over. Also the strip view window was dirty like someone pressed they face to the window and it wasn’t cleaned. Not sure who worked our room but they didn’t pay attention to details that is for sure.
10,Horrible check-in experience kept waiting for 3 hours past check-in before being offered an alternative room. Receptionis kept us waiting because one room was being cleaned instead of giving us another room
50,This is a great hotel. It is much cleaner and calmer than a lot of the hotels in Vegas. Rooms were very quiet clean and comfortable. We stayed four nights and really enjoyed our stay. We had a few very minor issues during our stay but their staff went way above and beyond to correct the little problem. During our stay we visited other hotels but we will pick this one over the others. If you want a quiet clean hotel for a relaxing vacation this would be it. We are in our 40’s and some hotels we definitely felt out of our element. Park MGM is very diverse and we felt just right for our age group. We look forward to coming back soon. Thank you for a wonderful stay.
10,We got there about 6 and there was no air coming out of the vent it was hot called Right after we got there nobody came the next day nobody came finally that next afternoon early evening the man came and fixed it but then when I bring it to somebody’s attention the young man who check this out basically said screw you i’m not touching this you have to call someone and stated there are no notes that you even called whatever
40,Short stay. But I ended up extending for a couples of hours and it wasn’t that expensive for a weekday. Good service and it’s close to the LAS airport. Walking distance to places to eat and not too crowded.
40,Rooms are comfortable and well appointed. Love the NO SMOKING policy. Casino is comparable to suitors. Things I would improve is having a quick bite option close by. Eating from the gift shop is not ideal. Also was almost impossible to get quick attention or questions from the front desk. Even at 3am there was a line. I like being able to check in digitally on my phone. But the digital keys don't work well in elevator so I got stuck going up and down the elevator numerous times until it worked. Had to get physical keys finally.
50,Close too airport clean lots of gaming.We didn't have to leave everything was in our hotel. Dj at the pool keep the vibe just right there were multiple pools and bars.Best Friend is a mist try experience servers were great also good music. The chef Roy Choi came out he was very friendly he allow us to take a picture with him.
50,This was our 2nd visit to the Park MGM. This time we noticed that it had been remodeled. The room was clean updated and comfortable. There are several restaurants within the Park MGM complex; you never really have to go anywhere else if you don't want to! We stayed there to attend the Bruno Mars concert since it was at the Park Theater which is part of the Park MGM. Lunch at Lala Noodle was excellent dinner at Eataly was outstanding and breakfast at Primrose was delicious! The Park was close to everything we wanted to do and we had a wonderful time!
30,The place was clean enough and the staff was very friendly. The room although very spacious had terrible furnishings and quite frankly was not all that clean. Also my AC unit was borderline effective.
50,No smoking allows for an enjoyable experience in the entire hotel/casino. Restaurant selections and inside walk to Aria is nice. Proximity to NYNY MGM Grand is also nice. Pools are good but get very crowded on weekends. We’ll be back soon.
40,Great hotel I stood for 3 nights not all rooms gave a coffee maker or frig so watch for that when you book. Beds were comfortable hotel was nice great breakfast at the Primrose Cafe . Overall good stay
50,Had an amazing experience at park mgm! My new go to hotel for sure! Would definitely recommend to anyone! Loved that it was a smoke free hotel as well! Amazing food options as well. Can’t wait for my next stay!
50,The rooms are nice the staff is exceptional but the smoke free part is the best! The pool has a great vibe on the weekends. The location is perfect with easy access to any other hotels and the airport.
50,Due to the amazing service and impeccable atmosphere it’s now and always a must stay for us. From the night life at On the Record the three amazing pools clean and smokeless casino and to Eatly it was a trip to remember
50,We stayed 3 nights- my husband myself and my dad. We had adjoining rooms and my dad was treated very well. The night of his birthday he played blackjack until 3:00 in the morning!!!! Everyone on the casino floor including the black jack dealer was patient and kind. 5 star treatment and we really appreciate it!
50,The hotel is beautiful the rooms are cozy (no minifridge though) and the lack of smoking made gambling so much more enjoyable. Eatily in the building is also wonderful. It was perfect for our 5-day trip away.
50,This was my first time staying at Park MGM and it was for our anniversary. It was very clean and we loved Eataly. There are some great specials in there and I would recommend it to anyone seeking good food on a budget. The rooms were cute and we really enjoyed our stay. Thanks for everything!
10,I woke up with bites and I’m hoping it’s not bed bugs also the location it perfect on the strip but everything was closed early also if you plan on driving here be prepared to pay a lot for parking they don’t validate parking. Also they gave me the worst view I was stuck on the 4th floor looking at a brick wall. Cleanliness wasn’t amazing I found random beer caps around the bed and some people were arguing outside my room all night before security ever got involved
10,Room was very sub-standard (standard) no clock no coffee pot sofa old and filthy. Dining table so tiny. Most specifically the bed mattress was SO lumpy and uncomfortable. Hardly got a good rest and sleep.
40,Check in went good although keywords issued worked first time but not when we left and came back. Had to go back to desk and wait to remedy the issue. Car was lost in valet Wednesday morning.  Other then that great stay.
50,The variety of different food were amazing. Everything from a slice of pizza to a great steak. We ate at Bavette Steak House. Everything we ordered was excellent! The Eataly has plenty of different menu items all in one place. You did need to leave the property for great food
50,Loved the property and that it was smoke free! Very clean and several pools. I would highly recommend and it is close to NY NY and other hotels. I will definitely stay there again!!!!! Easy access to walk to other places.
50,Great hotel. Best part? NON SMOKING venue. Yep! Pool casino rooms EVERYWHERE. Rooms were beautiful. Casino was fun. Lost what we planned on loosing but made up with fun and relaxing. Pool was very nice but somehow we got seated in the shaded area. Oh well.
50,Nice stay. The staff was friendly. This is center of the strip and we will stay there again in the future. Eataly reminded us of our visit to Rome and the big Eataly shopping center. We really appreciate the smoke free environment!
40,The staff and amenities at the Park MGM are wonderful. You feel very welcomed as soon as you walk through the doors of the hotel. I love that it’s centrally located on the strip and the staff is very friendly and helpful. The only thing I would like to see added would be a small refrigerator in the room for added comfort. I highly recommend staying at this hotel!
50,My stay was excellent the rooms were very clean and I loved all food areas . I wish there were a few more slot machines but I had a fabulous time with my family and we hope to be back later this year .
50,Really enjoyed staying at Park MGM. Thought it was in a good location affordable nice pool kind workers and just really enjoyed my time there. First time and would definitely return. Rooms were pretty big also
50,We had a National sales meeting after MGM renovated this property in 2018. Our team members still talk about the meeting memories. I have been back a few times for local business. Facility is still great!
50,First time stay! Loved it! Great service! Super cute room! Might have to cancel my Nov 2021 rsvp at NYNY and book here again!!! Anyways...    We stayed on the 28th FL overlooking the Tmo Arena. Loved the colors and decor. Got a great deal on the stay. No charge with housekeeping (Elara charged $40/nt to clean can opt out.) Only issue was the shower--gotta place towels on the floor otherwise the water will leak onto the floor. No biggy. Also sink/counter space is limit but it works. Outlets EVERYWHERE!! No need to find and/or share an outlet.
50,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The hotel is much more modern and relevant than the old Monte Carlo. The room was nice and bed was comfortable. The casino is bright and fun. The live band in the casino area was a nice touch. Best of all NO SMOKING! Would definitely want to stay here again.
40,"Love that the entire hotel is non-smoking! We found the hotel to be very clean. If you want something to eat late night you are limited to the Eataly which we ate pizza at once. Not a lot of tables were open. Most of them were $15-$25. We found that all over the strip. A couple of times they changed from $10 to $15 once we sat down at an empty table. We were grandfathered in but still quite the coincidence. Visited the pool once and found that you have to pay if you want a shaded seat. We were lucky to get the one open umbrella for free. The pool is down in a ""hole"" and does not get much air. If you decide not to get in the water it is hot fast! Pool drinks are very expensive. The first night we were there Saturday we were kept up with loud thumping and yelling from the nightclub. We were on the 30th floor so it must have been extremely loud inside that club! Also the noise from the strip traffic was bad. Other nights were better. The rooms are not soundproof but nice in the NoMad. We will go back. This hotel is conveniently located by a CVS and the walkway to Target. There is also a tram that runs to the Bellagio."
50,This is smoke free casino with relax atmosphere first class European suites. Rooms are very clean. Excellent restaurants: I love the restaurant Bevette’s. They have one of the best steaks in Vegas. We just love this hotel. Excellent management!!!
40,Park is the old Monte Carlo. It's one fo the few non-smoking casinos.. and that's nice. It is literally at 60 second walk to NYNY for people who want to smoke while gambling).. 5 minutes to MGM Grand.. and 10 minutes to Aria. Rooms were nice (clean.. no smell). Plenty of choices to eat on property and just a few minutes to at least 30 other choices in MGM's casinos or nearby on the strip.
30,Room was outdated. With the value better stay at MGM grand or Mirage or Signature. Pool was ok and kids can go to all three pools even if it says Adult only. I would recommended it but if you’re on a budget go for it. Good location though!
10,Not good at all. Room was dark. No dressers. No refrigerator. Didn't clean our room. A/C not working well. Shower flooded if you didn't direct it at the back wall. Old hotel tried to be rejuvenated. Did not work well.
50,I was there in town for a weddings. I have bad knees and ankles. If i hadn't been able to rent scooter my time would not have been good. The bed was confortable. Staff was plesant. . only thing room service food way to high and it wasn't good. Pancakes were horrible. Everyhing i ordered eas in different packages.
50,Was not to sure about trying a new hotel… But ended up falling in love with it. It is smaller than other casino properties and centrally located for our needs. Eataly was an experience and Best Friends was hands down the best meal of the trip.
50,Amazing food options (la la noodle best friend no mad everything in eatly) Staff cleaning constantly and always saying hello. Hours of some establishments were off but nothing to be upset about in a pandemic.
50,I love Park mostly because it is non smoking! The service is great and rooms were clean and smelled good. I am going back in Dec.  I have a lung condition and the clean air is very important to me.  They also have scooters at arrival.
50,I had a great stay at Park MGM. I used the MGM app to check in the night before and my room was ready when I arrived at the hotel. It was very easy to print physical keys using the kiosks. I had no wait in line for checkin. I had a strip view Nightingale Suite. It was a great size and was clean and comfortable. The room was right across from the elevators but the noise wasn't too bad. As others have said the AC had a hard time keeping the room cool. It was not overbearing but I would have liked it to be cooler. The casino on the other hand is fairly cold. They have a good selection of games and all of the employees I encountered were very polite and helpful. The restaurants were hit or miss with varying hours. Drink service on the casino floor was great. The best part is the non-smoking!
40,Nice rebranded casino resort. Most facets of the hotel stayed the same but many of the amenities such as the food choices have been well improved. The Street market style food court is a tremendous improvement of the boring mall style food courts found in most casinos. Definitely worth checking out if you remember the tired Monte Carlos themed hotel.
40,Love this hotel for the most part except cannot seem to figure out the pool area's general lack of...anything? It's literally 3 rectangular pools. What happened to the lazy river?? It's dull esp. for paying a resort fee. We might make this our winter hotel only and go elsewhere during the hot months. Other then that great smoke free casino (only one on the strip!) great restaurants Eataly is fantastic unique and cool rooms.
50,The hotel is the only non-smoking hotel which is great. The rooms are very nice clean and big. The pool area is great. It is a great location on the strip. Easy walking to other casinos. Close to the T- Mobile center for a lot of events.
50,Great property well run not too noisy doesn’t stink as they don’t allow smoking inside. Roy Choy restaurant and Eataly. Easy to get to Aria T-MOBILE Arena or grab a cab/Uber to go further afield because it has both Strip and non-strip car entrances
50,Clean suite roomspaciouswinning casino at park mgm.slots machine.. foods are good...we celebrated birthdays here with 25 guest from California and some relatives here in Las Vegas..casino host are frienly.
50,Overall check in and check out was super easy. They have self check in which prevents you from waiting in long line. The food places they offer are also great especially Rob Choys restaurant food was amazing and so was the service. Rooms are spacious and comfortable but the AC was not as cold as I would prefer sometimes it seemed to not be working but great stay nonetheless.
10,When I arrived I was checked into a dirty room! The room was not turned over and the towels were used. Then I was switched to another room where the shower would flood after 5 min of use. The sheets were stained and the carpet can unknown stains on them. Ordered room service the next morning waited an hour for them to bring the wrong order. Waited another 30 min for them to make my order incorrectly!! No manager available just the chef who claims he is the manager when one is not there! I had to call and wait on hold for an hour to get a food and beverage manager to refund my money! (Only one for the entire hotel) I was also supposed to receive shot play per my promotion the front desk acted like they did not know what I was referring to. This was the worst experience ever! Only stayed here because my flight was delayed and the Venetian was booked. STAY AT THE VENETIAN they have far better accommodations and the rooms are 1000 times better. They are the same price during the week. The staff at Park MGM are rude abrasive and no manager seems to be available ever! I left Hungry with no slot play per my promotion and disappointed! You will regret staying here even if you receive a promotion! They should pay guest to stay there not the other way around. The best thing they have at Park MGM is Bruno Mars!
30,Friendly staff but overpriced stay. The pools are small and crowded the rooms are just okay nothing crazy great. Primrose was a great place to eat and they had some cool bars. Had a great experience at Park Theater as well. Overall it just felt like a very average resort.
50,Location is solid and the entire hotel is super clean. The check in process is fast and easy. The strip view was nice. The rooms look very new and were spotless. Overall it’s a really great hotel that won’t break the bank.
50,Non smoking and new casino and great customer service. Close to everything on the strip. Small room size but cute. Drinks at the pool were yummy. Kids pool. Nice ambiance music at the pool area. Clean restrooms.
50,our room was great service was great overall everything was outstanding cant wait to come back next year food was fine able to get around to other places pool was good i really don't know that anything was wrong oh yes most important i have COPD and you are smoke free thank you so much
50,Hubby and I stayed here on our vacation to Vegas. I really like the location on the strip of this place. It's very clean the employees are helpful and professional and because it's smoke-free it smells so much cleaner and fresher than the other casinos around. The only upgrade in the rooms I would offer is a mini-fridge.
40,Thumbs up for no smoking! Location is very central. Casino is just right for me can’t get lost☺️ Love Sandra so very helpful from our very first stay which has to have been 4 or 5 years ago. Have been staying at the park since.
50,I like to come to Vegas to enjoy all it has to offer - gambling restaurants shows everything! However I don't smoke and on the strip it's nearly impossible to avoid smelling like smoke. The Park MGM is smoke free throughout its entire casino which had an unexpected benefit that my clothes didn't smell like it when I returned home. It's amazing what a difference that can make if it's important to you. The casino and hotel staff are very friendly and engaging and it's kept immaculately clean. I also enjoyed the quality of everything at Eataly which had enough variety I didn't have to leave the hotel to eat. One of my favorite unexpected surprises was a live band that was performing cover songs as shouted out by the audience. They were really good but you also couldn't hear them if you were farther away in the casino - I don't know how they did this trick but for those not wanting to hear them you could still enjoy yourself too. It just feels like the Park MGM has somehow addressed everyone's needs in Vegas and it's my favorite place to stay now.
50,Great place to stay especially if you love having smoke free and pot free environment. Clean and comfortable excellent and caring staff. Ever since covid Vegas has declined down to a ghetto environment pot stench every where low class people every where casinos allowing non-service dogs on the casino floor. My stay at the Park MGM was a refreshing change.
50,Some gambling some drinking good food great service and a very nice room. The time in the pool before the crowds was especially pleasing. I love the layout the ease of outdoor access and Eataly is a wonderful addition for the dinner/lunch options.
50,The environment in which I choose to stay makes or breaks my vacation. And The Park is now my new favorite! I’m coming from Caesar’s Palace which is still a great place but how they edged them out was when they went smoke free! As you’ve guessed I’m definitely not a smoker never have been. So when I’m out trying to enjoy myself it gets hard when my chest and head starts to hurt all around Vegas! Now I can sleep eat and even play slots in a beautiful bustling smoke free place!! Thumbs Up! Will only stay here from now on! 🤩🤩🤩
50,The food options were great and had a lot of fun during our stay. Best Friend lived up to the hype and Primrose and Eataly were also great. Enjoyed the smoke-free casino area and had a blast at On The Record!
50,Hotel is clean liked that it was smoke free! That’s a real plus! Our stay was brief but if I were to return to Begas I would stay here again. The staff are helpful and accommodating. My room did not have a refrigerator in it but with one phone call one was brought to our room.
50,We had a wonderful 3 day stay. We love the nonsmoking aspect of the Park. The food options are excellent. The rooms are spacious and have great views. The employees were all helpful and accommodating. The casino was clean and had many choices. It was a great stay. We will return.
50,I absolutely love that this whole property is 100% smoke free! Add in the fact that there is a Eataly on-site along with numerous other great restaurants and it’s the perfect location to stay in Las Vegas!
50,You really can’t go wrong when it comes to not smelling like smoke when you get back to your room after spending time in the casino. The fact that the property is non smoking was the reason I booked with this hotel.
50,Service was excellent. Location is great close to everything. Rooms are clean and great value. Eataly downstairs is an excellent addition. Food choices are incredible.The club On The Record is phenomenal. Great ambiance and music. I would highly recommend this hotel.
50,The Park MGM hotel was great! The rooms are very confortable!! It was weird to be in Las Vegas and not have everything open yet. You had to wear your mask down to the pool and then everyone took them off outside.
50,From the moment you check in to the moment you check out the service is amazing. It did not matter who you asked there was always someone to answer any questions you have. I had a little asthma flare up and it was nice to have a smoke free hotel. Definitely would stay again
50,Park MGM is a great hotel on the strip that is modern with simple amenities. Rooms are pretty basic but retain a charming feel. Room elevators are at the back of the resort (off of the Check In lobby and almost a straight walk from the parking garage). The casino is setoff entirely from Las Vegas Blvd making it a little less traveled than others. The pool area is similar to most other resorts in Vegas. There are three separate areas. And then there's a separate pool location entirely that is more of the typical Vegas club/pool party vibe.  Park MGM does have quite a few unique fun and good places to eat and drink. I would recommend almost any venue here because they are all so diverse from each other.    There's a Target and a Walgreens across the street and a CVS next door.
50,My wife and I have been coming to Vegas for over 40 years and we found the Park MGM to be one of the best experiences we have had there. We are staying there again next month and many more times to come.
50,The rooms are very nice as well as the restaurants. We had breakfast at Primrose and enjoyed it.  We really enjoy the smoke free rooms and casino. That’s part of what brings us back to the Park.the new overpass just outside the hotel is another big plus.
40,love location to Eataly and others - dont spend much time in rooms but they are nice and walk-in shower too. Not sure what the $40/nt resort fee did for me - pools are too busy. Did use the gym - is nice and spa - had to pay for spa. --- I was bitten by some kind of bug/spider both nights - 3 on side the first night - then one big one on abdomen the next - and still have a welt weeks later !?!?!?!?!?
50,And you cannot go wrong with the rooms at the park MGM. The hotel is clean casino is clean service is great for me it’s just the best. It checks all the boxes the sweets are just amazing with great square footage and awesome layout. I really don’t think you need to stay anywhere else besides here at the park MGM
50,Park mgm has always taken great care of me. To the great customer service beautiful rooms spacious casino floor and marvelous views from each hotel room has to offer you can't go wrong staying at Park Mgm. Thank you Park Mgm I can't wait to go back!!!!
50,The room was clean and very nicely decorated. The staff were extremely helpful and friendly. The staff I in countered with seem to really enjoy their jobs. Melissa whom worked pool side was super nice and informative.
50,The Park MGM is a great option. Clean rooms. Non smoking casino made for enjoyable gambling without people smoking cigarettes everywhere. Classy boutique feel and a little on the quieter side compared to neighboring strip hotels.
50,Everything was simply amazing. Great staff. We really enjoyed our stay and will be back very soon. Thank you so much for everything that was provided to us. The food was really good as well and we enjoyed gambling in the casino as well
30,There are a couple reason I put unsatisfied. The first reason would be that there are no refrigerators and I know that wouldn’t be easy to fix but it would definitely be nice on ninety to a hundred degrees plus especially when dealing with leftover foods. The second reason is that our air conditioning would not go under seventy-five degrees again it would be nice on hot days. The third reason is that the ice buckets are so small that it is so hard to keep anything cold. Nothing to serious but those things definitely made the stay uncomfortable.
40,My son and I plan at least one trip a year to Vegas. Our last trip was canceled due to COVID restrictions. While not ideal the Park managed to accommodate very well. We still had to mask up at the gaming table and the plexiglass between the dealer/players made it hard to heard we still enjoyed our stay. Of course the restrictions were lifted two weeks after we left but we already have a reservation at NoMad for May 2022.
50,Wonderful service atmosphere and quiet was what I found at the Park MGM. Friendly staff and an upgrade made it more special. It was small enough I actually could find my way around the hotel. I look forward to staying there more often! The location is perfect for dining shopping and getting around and there was no wait for cabs or Uber.
40,There was a lot to like about our stay at the Park MGM back over 4th of July weekend. For a property on the Strip my five night stay was not terribly expensive (think it ran me about $700 though I have an MLife Rewards card). The fact that it's a smoke free casino was a big plus. We rented a cabana at the pool which was awesome. The sports book and associated bar were top notch. My only nitpick is with the dining options. I wasn't terribly impressed with Eataly and the lack of a buffet was disappointing. I also wish they had a poker room. But that aside I would definitely stay there again given the opportunity
50,I like the location of Park MGM - a quieter stretch of the strip within a short walk of all the hustle and bustle - and I've stayed there several times for conferences. My room was clean and in good order as always. It's jolting - in a good way - to walk across the casino floor without smelling any smoke. I thought they might take a hit with their non-smoking decision but clearly they did not. The restaurants and bars on site are all top-notch for quality and service.
50,Good size casino. Nice clean rooms Great staff. Easy parking and super great food at Eataly. could use a few shows. trying Nomad in November top four floors of Park Mgm easy access right on strip and has its on tram stop.
50,I really liked the room. Having a couch is a nice touch. Also the casino even though it's non-smoking was super fun. We ate at Best Friend which was super delicious! I would definitely stay here again. Also the Eataly was amazing.
50,We’ve stayed at many places in Vegas over the years and this was my favorite! Great location comfortable well designed! We will definitely stay here again. I loved that it was smoke-free. Also so enjoyed the pool area!
40,The moment we learned it is a non smoking casino we were sold right then & there we booked. The staff were amazing from front desk down to housekeeping. The rooms/hotel in general are not fancy but we don’t come to Vegas to sleep so it was fine with us. The little problem We didn’t like was that the restaurants won’t take your order via phone because they don’t deliver upstairs. The only room service dining they have has breakfast menu & time limit. Other than that our stay was perfect 👍
50,The rooms were nice and perfect if you’re seeing a show at Park Theater! Lots of places to eat. It is a bit of a walk to get to the other side of the strip but the monorail is over at MGM Grand and definitely worth it. Friendly helpful staff and a gorgeous hotel.
50,Everything was wonderful. Room was clean and bed was comfy. The shower is so relaxing like a heavy waterfall. Restaurants were great. Definitely try Best Friends and Eataly. Make some time for the pool too! Music food and drinks ALL GREAT.
40,Convenient hotel on the strip. Room was fine but overpriced IMO - but I was there for Gold Cup final. Clean room. Check in was slow. Loved that the casino was smoke-free. Absolutely no enforcement of the NV mask mandate by hotel staff which was annoying to me. Restaurants will be reviewed separately. And the “resort fee” is the biggest rip off ever.
50,I had an amazing time celebrating my birthday at Park MGM. The customer service was excellent. Brian I. is definitely an asset to your team. He went above and beyond to ensure our experience was memorable. Did I mention Bruno Mars was EVERYTHING! Best performance ever.
30,This was our first time staying at this hotel. PROS: Good location quiet room clean room good security nice pools. CONS: Very expensive for what you get we had a regular King and it was small only one vanity in bathroom and it was small no mini frig or coffee maker. Had to go to Starbucks in lobby and stand in line to get an expensive cup of coffee. Room was very plain but remodeled and clean. Had long check-in line so tried the app check-in. You better be computer literate to use this otherwise you'll be standing in line for awhile. It's better to get an actual key card than trying to use the app to open your door. They screwed up our bill and I just now got it squared away. Everything in the hotel is expensive. Had a 12 oz glass of Coors Light draft and it was $10 at the casino bar! Minimum $15 table games. Be careful of the water pressure in the shower...it is so strong it will almost blast the dirt off of you (can't be regulated). Room service missed cleaning our room one day so they comped us one days resort fee. If you stay on the strip I would definitely do your drinking and gambling off of the strip. Conclusion: Only reason we stayed there was because of a concert that was at the hotel. You can definitely tell that Vegas is trying to recoup their losses from last year by the prices everywhere. Next time we'll find a cheaper hotel on the strip with more free amenities.
10,Rude dealers staff and security. Unresolved payout issues on roulette tables. Racist remarks to Asian guest in the casino. We wanted to check out 4 hours after arriving.... we hadn't even gone to sleep yet.
30,Hotel Room needs to be updated was in a suite - room size was impressive but carpet was stained and worn.  Check process is very slow even after I was notified my room was ready - could not check in at Lobby kiosk or app both were down
50,We enjoyed our park stay. The rooms is nice an quite. Good location for a concert at the Park theater. Short walk to Aria and City Center or take the tram to the Bellagio. Good option in dining selection.
30,Shower door not sealed Water all over the bathroom floor. Guest could have accident. Housekeeping should report this things to their supervisor and supervisor should take action. This is very dangerous to guest especially older people and children
20,House keeping does not clean the room and requesting towels was a problem the phone of my first room wasn't working I had to wait in line long time using my cellphone to call front desk to request a room change. Second room it took a while to get clean towels
50,Park MGM offers a clean smoke free fun environment. The 3 pools are perfect with great restaurant choices right there in the casino available to you! I would stay at the Park for every trip! Every staff member was helpful and nice!
40,The hotel was nice. It is in a great location. My wife and I enjoyed the environment. The fact it was remodeled and smoke free made he most impact on us. The staff was great. We ate at Primrose and had a wonderful server. All of the dealers and cocktail servers were great. The front desk person was not as friendly as everyone else. The room was ok. The minibar was not stocked or even hooked up.
40,The hotel was beautiful and comfortable. There was a long hold time for the bell desk. We waited on hold for over 30 minutes without anyone answering the phone. We basically wasted an hour waiting for no one to answer and have to proceed to take our luggage down ourselves. Definitely don’t waste the time during peak check out hours. Loved the check in and out through the mobile app feature.
50,The staff was absolutely amazing.  We could not have asked for more.  The valet team was extremely helpful.  The pool staff went out of their way to make sure all of our needs were met before we even asked!!!!!!  Thank you!
50,I love to stay at the Park MGM. The rooms are comfortable and hip it’s non-smoking everywhere on property the restaurants and bars are great the pools are good and the Park Theater is right there to enjoy concerts.
40,Poor air conditioning Very expensive meals extras. I could not sleep because the air wasn't working properly. Food at the restaurants was very poor - and Very expensive even for Las Vegas. Beautiful rennovation but won't be back until the management fixes these problems.
20,We woke up to find carpet beetles crawling in our bed and contacted the front desk. They sent us to another room and said we would hear from a member of management. We were on the way out to a reservation to celebrate my wife’s birthday and asked if we could move when we got back but the front desk was pretty insistent that we move rooms now so we did. When we finally heard from management they told us that everything was okay because the room tested negative for beg bugs as if that makes it less disgusting to wake up to bugs crawling in the bed with you. Nothing else was said or done about the matter.
30,Stayed here for a couple of nights. Booked the nighthawk suite.    Pros:  Non smoking casino  Not too busy  To me one of the best locations  Nighthawk suite is spacious and funky    Cons  Can hear everything neighbours say  Skyhawk suite strip view only with queen beds (king is non strip)  Valet - can’t call down and VERY slow (up to 1/2 hour!)
10,The room is too small and old. The location is alright it’s in the middle of the trip. No fridge in the room. The room is too simple. Fast check in with your phone. Won’t come back again. I like the food court which provide Italy food
50,No contact check in was easy pleasant personnel and cleanliness were on point exceptional service with a comfortable bed and plenty of entertainment. I left Park MGM feeling really good about my experience overall I was Happy.
40,Park MGM has always been an outstanding hotel as well as all the other MGM Hotels. They have a great variety of services. The hotel is very clean. Fun for all family members and you have to check out the casino floors.
10,If I could give no stars I would...checked in to room the key did not work ok no problem. Asked for room closer to the elevator got a dirty room. They moved us back to the room we had room also dirty once we got in. They said oh we'll send housekeeping. Housekeeping came an hour later after I cleaned what wasn't cleaned myself after waiting. I sent an email to no response on this part of our experience. Two days later our key stopped working another day apparently our cc (that they took and authorized at check in) wasn't on file so they locked us out the front desk agent didn't know and gave us new keys. We received a call later saying no cc was on file we need to stop by the desk. We told them they split the incidentals on our cards at check in and showed her the authorization on our accounts. The agent said its supposed to be on one card. I said yall told us we could and did charge our cards. I had the email evidence of this and showed her. They said no we were supposed to authorize for incidentals and the resort fee. So I figured out after much back and forth they needed the money for the resort fee. The girl who checked us in said we could pay that at the end. I just said can we pay the fee now. I had a death in the family and I was drained from all the stuff that happened and the hotel experience thus far so at this point I was fed up and over it all. We got that straight went upstairs. Next day we're checking out another person in our party saw that he was overcharged for incidentals so he was waiting in line to get that straight and security just popped up beside us...this man was going on about some schedule or some bs but I felt like he was called since we were just standing there and not in line...final straw for me on property. No I wasn't imagining it because why tf was he randomly telling us about his schedule out of nowhere and we weren't talking to him....Trash ass place never again. Come to find out I get home and weeks go by and my incidentals hold has not dropped. I work at a hotel so I know it takes time to return but it was way past time so I had to dispute the charges and got my money back. My friend who was in the room with me also had to and they only returned some of her money which she has to fight because she paid the resort fee on a separate card. All in in this place was utter trash and shout out to everyone who had a pleasant experience as for me it was horrible and uncomfortable. I'm sure they have enough money to not care about this review so me writing it may be pointless but definitely be careful if you go there. I recommend not at all
20,For the price of this hotel per night please update AC and light fixtures and old table with a family room chair there was poor light for makeup no refridge no microwave not at all happy for my buck sorry thumbs down.
30,Got the Bruno Mars package. Our room was just okay. Pool View was good should have requested a lower floor. Seemed like staff lack smile on their faces. Parking not free for VIP check in. Carpet seemed unkept and unclean.... felt sticky walking on them. The wall paper was at it's bare minimum. Looked like a cheap hotel sorry. Lobby though was neat looking. Food court or the Eataly was convenient. Easy access to the stores and restaurants at the strip.
50,This hotel is very clean and has a very convenient location. I love that the whole hotel is no-smoking. The rooms are spacious. The shower is spacious and the blackout curtains are amazing. The bed is very comfortable. The staff is super nice. Check-in and check-out was quick and easy. Only things I would change is find a way for the A/C to blow harder. It didn’t blow very hard and it often took awhile for the room to cool down. I would also like to see the hotel find a way to keep our cell phones from losing signal or WiFi on the elevators. Losing the wifi made it impossible to access digital room key while on elevator. It also made it hard for digital key to work when signal and WiFi was lost
50,How many times do you go to a place where they say non-smoking but you go up to your room and your entire floor has smoke or something like it. Finally a hotel that is clean non-smoking friendly & does what it says.
10,Had to change rooms 4 times air conditioning sucks only one breakfast restaurant room service only until 2pm during the week is terrible no true gift shops. My husband and I went for a couples weekend and it was not romantic and was pretty miserable for the price.
40,Liked hotel and mixologist at Nomad Bar. Did not get to eat in hotel but Eataly looked incredible. Also had drinks at Provence Bar and bartender was great! Obviously we liked the bars...Gambled only a bit.
20,We were waking up in a sweat every single night. I was with a group and we had 3 different hotel rooms on different floors. None of them cooled down regardless of the shades being closed. We had the room as cool as possible but nothing helped. Also digital cards were frustrating and we rode the elevator up and down several times because we couldn't select our floor and no one was available to help without waiting in extensive check in line.
50,Hotel is nice and a great value for the $$. Location is great! Staff and hotel were great. Really convenient to the strip and everything around. Easy Uber/Lyft area. We didn't use the pool or spend a ton of time inside the hotel but for a nice place to stay and enjoy the strip it was perfect!
40,This property is a good pick if you are looking to stay on The Strip have easy access to the Park Theater and several decent food options. It also is connected to a free tram that travels to The Aria and The Bellagio (minimizing travel costs). Rooms are basic but clean with a view and staff is nice.
50,It was nice to have Eataly attached. Fairly central location nice sized room. AC in the casino was nice and cold. Liked the Lady Gaga museum. We overlooked the T-Mobile arena and liked to people watch. The walls seemed a bit thin at times.
40,I had a great experience at Park MGM. The staff was very accommodating and welcoming. The location was great as well. The only thing I would say is the room was slightly outdated with no fridge but the bathroom was updated and nice.
50,Park mgm has outdone itself with the new venues the extreme cleanliness as well as the exceptional service. When you have a casino manager (Sean) take the time out of his schedule to address a concern it clearly shows the passion the employees have for their property and the guest service you can expect when you come visit. I’ve only stayed at this location and now that it’s non smoking this will forever be my go to whenever I visit Vegas- we go around 6-8 times per year with about 15 people or so each time
40,We stayed at Park MGM for 4 nights August 12th thru the 16th. Carpet and furniture in room was a little dated. Overall the room was clean. I loved that the casino was smoke free. The 3 separate pool areas really helped by not being overcrowded. The mobile check in and the ability to make our own keys upon arrival was extremely smooth and stress-free no waiting in a check in line for hours
50,This was a great place to stay. Smoke free environment and a great location. Almost center of the strip for the places I am willing to walk to.Eataly provides more than adequate eating options. Depending on the day it can be quite busy. I happened to be there the weekend of George Strait and Bruno Mars. There was heavy traffic in the Casino but not anything concerning to me considering this is Las Vegas. I was also able to take an inexpensive cab rid to see some NBA Summer League games. I spent most of my time in and around Park MGM and was totally content with my trip and experience here.
50,This hotel is a breath of fresh air considering it’s a smokeless casino you can distinguish this hotel from any on the south strip! The aroma is one of vanilla and roses and the casino is a very cozy environment with amazing service from cocktail waitresses! The room it’s self is also a very cozy feel like room! Very minimalistic and spacious yet very modern and super clean! This was an amazing hotel to add on to a great trip I would definitely recommend you stay at this hotel to anyone!
40,Nice hotel although Nomad pool not accessible ….which I would have preferred not all restaurants were open … nice casino … good location to access strip and good value for money…. Housekeeping was alway very prompt and efficient
40,Good location with lots of dining options. Tram available to take you to other hotel which was nice in 100 degree weather. Rooms are nice with great view of the strip. Each time I have been to Vegas I stay in a different hotel and I wouldn't mind staying here again.
50,location: great especially if you are going to the arena for anything.  Food: amazing  Rooms: comfortable and spacious with nice amenities.  Gaming: smaller but had everything you needed  Staff: friendly and helpful
50,The stay at Park MGM was an amazing experience. The staff was knowledgeable professional and helpful. The room and view were breathtaking!! We literally never left the hotel because everything was so inviting and convenient. The restaurants in the hotel serve mouthwatering dishes and drinks that made our trip absolutely perfect. Will definitely be back to visit again soon!!
30,Our room was dark red and depressing with old carpets and random furniture not the crisp clean green as shown on the website. I had expected much more from an M-life property. The hallways were sad until you got to the casino and spa and then the décor was peaceful and fresh. The one advantage is that it is close to T-mobile arena.
50,Love virtual checkin/out. Room was ok (ac needed to be dusted for sure) but the highlight of our one night stay was mark cooper at the pool bar - he was so personable and really made our stay amazing. Please recognize Mark for his amazing customer service!
50,I have stayed at many Vegas properties. To be transparent I do focus on MGM properties as I have MLife and work on my tier credits. Park MGM is non-smoking Hotel AND Casino. I don’t like playing in other casinos because I invariably have a stinky smoker sitting by me. Just walking in to other casinos I can immediately smell the smoke. Park MGM is literally a breath of fresh air!
50,Just what was needed. Great weekend getaway to relax and have some fun. Room upgrade made it all that much better. Lots of good place to eat and the pool is a lot of fun. Primrose has a fantastic brunch too. Try the bottomless Mimosas
50,The Whole property is clean and nice… always know what to expect. Staff friendly and helpful! Rooms nice and sports book staff is friendly and helpful..casino floor easy to navigate and well marked.
50,Literally a breath of fresh air! Very surprised and pleased with our visit.. very likely I would Stay again! Very modern decor and the choices of places to eat were high end- I felt bad just wearing a shirt BUT was still treated like a valued guest.
50,Came to see Bruno Mars. Was a great show and the theater was an amazing place to see a show every seat had a great view. Bruno Mars did not disappoint. The hotel and casino are smoke free this is so refreshing and makes time gambling enjoyable. Rooms are little basic in design and furnishing but nice Great shower
40,My daughter and myself booked this quick trip to attend Bruno Mars within the hotel.  Pros:  centrally located within Vegas.  room was super clean  A NON smoking casino ( big plus)  they didn't charge me for late check out ( my flight was delayed)  CONCERT was amazing!!!!!    Cons: confusing directions on how and where to pick up tickets for the concert -- got three different answers ( It was long lines to get answers)  short staffed ( not there fault)  Not enough towels provided in the room . we were provided 2 towels and one wash cloth and one hand towel . I asked housekeeping for ONE extra washcloth young lady said they were allowed because of them being short staffed and not have enough people in laundry . i did inform her she could skip our room for our stay as long as i got an extra wash cloth ( i just needed one for me and my daughter) She did finally give me a wash cloth .    I would stay here again
20,Arrived at the Park MGM on business. After a walk through depressing dark green hallways arrived to find my room slightly dirty with some random broken items in the corners. No room service available (after 2pm) no bottled water disposable cups or tea. Had to fend for myself to find these items in the casino. Then throughout a Monday night music blaring from the arena that even my earplugs couldn't block out keeping me up all night. No warning or accommodation for any of this from the front desk. Only extra star is for the non-smoking hotel which is a rarity in Vegas. But will not be back.
50,Looking for the right place to enjoy a mini-get-away ... Park is the spot for you - variety of gaming options for all types of styles and the Park team has that extra extra positive approch to making your stay there feel effortless without taxing delays or maxing out on patience... Park environment allows you to be in moment - and that is the WHY Vegas !!
20,I reserved a king bed room. Room was not available when I arrived so they “upgraded “ me to a two bed queen suite. When arrived at suite restroom had completely dirty walls stained with makeup and dirt and shower was clogged. Had to go to check in counter to advise of situation. So they gave me regular room and had to move all my belongings and was a complete waste of valuable time that I had planned that evening.
50,If youre a person who keeps a full charge on your phone and and love a great bed then this is teh hotel for you! you can do everything from checkin room keys and parking right from your smart phone. I'd say the staff was friendly but I had no interactions because everything was made so easy through the MGM app. Love the bathrooms beds and pillows - very important. My go to hotel!
50,The customer service was supreme. This was my second time coming to Vegas and staying at the parks MGM it was a wonderful experience everything including the room was perfect. I love the location I love the customer service and I will always love Vegas.
40,Great price just what we needed for our getaway. Good Location to many attractions within short walk or tram ride. Variety of food choices and a non-smoking casino!! Great service from staff and clean.
30,Pros. Best location. Easy to walk to most places. Could visit Ceasers Palace Bellagio cosmopolitan planet Hollywood New York New York and Aria very easily by walking or tram. Lots of food options. Clean Rooms and staff are very accommodating. Cons. Mostly had to do with the room. Very thin walls/could hear everything your neighbors are talking about and every time a door closed all through the night. I had a lot of issues with the internet and cable on the TV. The lighting is awful in this room.. you cannot turn on enough lights. The decor was pretty bad as well. Looks like a 70’s motel. I pay higher prices not to see that. The hallways were so dim it was hard to see and felt a bit creepy walking to the room. I would stay again because of the location but because of the price I would probably go to the Vdara.
40,Check in was easy and early without an additional fee. The room while basic is pretty decent especially for the price. The large walk in shower is also a plus. The draw down black out shades are great at blocking out all light. Finally navigation is pretty easy as the property is not too big.
20,Bad experience if you get room 5117 please ask for a different room. Paper thin walls old disturbing shower unclean shower head AC not working. We have loved our park rooms in the past but beware if you get put on this floor and in this room.
40,Park MGM has the best location on the strip. It is a good area of town and you feel safe coming and going even if you are alone. The rooms need updated and the beds need box springs added. It feels like you are sleeping on the floor.
50,The non-smoking resort is SO much nicer than smelling like a dirty ashtray as soon as you walk across the street to one of the smoking casinos you just want to go back to the park so you can breath again. Room was pretty clean hallway needed vacuuming and bed was too soft for me.
40,Park MGM was a very very great value table games were very slow at times. I recommend eating at Best Friend. If you are a young couple and want a cool hop environment I would recommend this property.
40,We got the Sleep Well room. If you want to pay extra for the memory foam then it's recommended. Everything else though it truly was just fluff. Get the brioche french toast at Primrose super yummy!
40,Fantastic restaurants great service and we loved the lack of smoke. Great location. We were close to all the spots we wanted to visit. The casino and most of the staff were great. We also enjoyed the pool where we rented the day bed. It was a nice trip.
50,We have stayed on the Strip many many times. We have stayed mostly at The Bellagio but decided to give this a try based on rebranding from Monte Carlo remodeling price location and smoke free. Glad we did! Room was very nice great bed and shower. Eatily restaurant area fun. Starbuck’s easy access to New York New York and easy bridge walk to ABC store help make it ideal Glad we gave this a four night chance. We liked everything about it.
50,I have stayed at the Park MGM pre-COVID and really liked it. This stay did not disappoint me - compared to the service at Lemon Grass @ Aria and El Segundo at Fashion Square. Park MGM staff and service was professional and inviting - customer first. Those other two restuarants could use some training from the Park MGM staff on how to treat a (any) customer during a pandemic.
20,To me certain things are and necessary when traveling like a bath and a good cup of coffee in the morning. I was not able to get either of those staying at this place as this place does not offer a bathtub nor even a coffee pot to make coffee in. You cannot warm up food if you have a baby you can't even keep anything in the refrigerator for them it's not a person that has like a family of this is more of if you're just waking up and going out to party 24/7. Which isn't the case with everyone.
50,Location location location! Everything you need is at your fingertips! Pool is great Eataly is the best and easy access to your room! This is the place to be! Park MGM is in the middle of it all!!!
50,We had a great stay the only thing that we would have something negative to say is that we wished the pool had later hours they closed at 7pm which we would have loved to have a couple more evening hours to swim. Everything else was amazing and we would absolutely stay again!
50,Park MGM has inviting and outdoorsy decor. The staff is friendly and helpful! Primrose is a quaint eatery with great menu selections. Eataly has awesome pizza pasta pastries and gelatos. The ambience of Eataly feels like you’re in Italy!
30,The location is good  Rooms are clean smell fresh  Nice pools would be better if they had an adults pool only .  The workers are horrible. I only came across one helpful worker  if they aren’t going to be helpful then customer service isn’t for you . Checking out is ridiculous. There’s 6 key drops so you drop your key but then you can’t get out of the parking lot without a parking key? So why say drop your key off if you can’t get out of the building . Need better employees. Best friend restaurant was the only place I found another nice employee
40,Location is great food is great. STAFF is wonderful and it's clean. The pool and the drinks and food there was out of this world I was a little unhappy with my room it needed alot of repairs but I will stay there again and will ask for an upgrade
50,The stay was comfortable. The rooms were spacious. We loved that it was no smoking. Wish room service was available earlier and later for early coffee and late food. Starbucks on site didn’t open until 7 and the quality was not great.
20,The decor restaurants and smoke-free casino were all excellent. I would absolutely recommend the Park MGM as a place to visit but skip staying at the hotel.    The rooms have been updated and are nicely designed but the small size and small windows feel like a low value compared to other options to stay on the strip.    Several amenities were out of order during our week long stay including the ice machine on our floor. Since the rooms don’t have mini fridges this meant we were not able to keep cold drinks snacks or leftovers. Our interactions with the staff about the issue were pretty frustrating. They were unable to give us access to another floor with a working machine or to send up ice to our room. This obviously isn’t the biggest problem that could come up but in the future I will look for a property with a stronger focus on customer service.
30,Had issues with smells in the restroom like sewage it was nasty. Unfortunately they did not have a solution for our smelly restroom. It was sad we couldn't spend more time in our room due to the strong smell.
40,Restroom was stinky n dirty.  15$ for parking is foolishness even though I’m pearl tier free.  Need more single 0 Rouelette tables . And there’s no fridge and ice machine was broken; terrible place. Not many selection to go eat there
40,Love that The property is non-smoking. The clientele seems to be a little bit older compared to other hotels on the strip so it is not as crazy or loud etc. Great restaurants on site! So convenient to have a target store right across the street for last minute needs and also to head up there Starbucks which had zero line at any time of day
40,The check in and check out process was very quick and easy. Our room was ok but could use a little up grading. The shower was new. We had a view of the three pools. I like that the casino is not huge and you can’t get lost in it. There are many restaurants to try we tried a few. It is located right on the main strip so it was easy to get to in order to check out the other sites. All the staff members were nice. The dealers were all friendly.
50,I had the good fortune to take advantage of an offer I received to visit Park MGM Las Vegas. The resort is in a great location for getting around town. I loved the room the Nighthawk Suite with a king bed. Staff was exceptional. The restaurants in and around the resort were very good.
50,So awesome not to constantly smell smoke and to know that your room has an air purifier cleaning out all the germs floating around in the air.  Oh and the mattress it’s memory foam you literally melt in the bed
30,The hotel was in a perfect spot close to ally of attractions and stores.I really enjoyed being across from the T-Mobile arena and the park .Bruno Mars also preformed at the hotel 2 nights great show .Thanks Park mgm.
10,Hallway had soiled carpet. Rooms were not cleaned properly. They charge a resort fee and $100 PER NIGHT deposit however providing at best 2 star hotel experience. Changed room 3 times because of unclean rooms and upgrade was denied.
40,I'm not a smoker & although I realize it's Vegas I still hate walking through the smoke filed casino floor. I love the fact that Park MGM is smoke free! The main floor decor is stunning they did a really great job. The addition of Eataly was gorgeous as well! Only negative thing I have to say is the suites aren't worth the extra $$$. The shower was tiny & there was no wow factor.
10,Outdated rooms and finishes. Our shower leaked bad and there was hair in bathroom upon checking in. Hotel amenities are sub par. Stay elsewhere. Also their app doesn’t work Will and their check in process can be very chaotic
30,I was staying on a Sunday and almost every bar was closed. Had to go elsewhere for a bar atmosphere a major inconvenience. The design of the rooms were ugly but they were clean. The walls were quite thin was able to hear everything my neighbors were saying.
30,We picked this hotel bc it had a decent location and price and because it has a smoke free casino but that was it for the positives. The walls in the rooms are paper thin to sounds and smells and the beds are just OK. The room service menu is lame too.
50,The cleanest and friendliest casino on the strip. They always catered to the customers and ensured they were serviced in a timely manner. Eataly has always provided the best in fresh authentic European style foods and wine.
10,Room was dirty and there was food on the carpet. Ice Machine was broken. On my floor there was no ice and with my access card you can’t go to another floor. Worst experiences ever. A/C says that it is 60 degree but it feels like 80 degree it doesn’t go below. I’m very disappointed by the service and room setup. I hallways were dirty.
50,I read lots of reviews and was sceptical. But I LOVED my room. The beds/pillows were very comfortable. I had an amazing view of the city & mountains from the 23rd floor. It's 5 minute walk to the MGM food court & drug stores.
40,We were pleasantly surprised at how nice the Park MGM was fresh and clean air and freshly renovated look that was modern but classical. Although we had to wait in line for almost 30 minutes during check in a staff from the VIP area was kind enough to take pity on us and help register us and move the line along.    The Hotel and Rooms were very nicely decorated and clean although a bit stuffy until we can in and set the temperature to the AC. We thought the rooms were nicely decorated and enjoyed walking around the hotel and having a cocktail at the Primrose.    However things took a turn Saturday night with guests and their drunken behavior. We encountered one guest that was so drunk that she didn't notice her breast hanging out of her dress another vomiting from drunkeness and another that I can only imagine decided to clean up after himself as we found his dirty sock in the elevator with signs of having been sick. The Escalators to the Self Park went from prestine to food and drinks thrown all over the floor in what one could only imagine was a disregard for their surroundings.
10,The sliding bathroom door jammed my finger my wife's finger and our kid's finger got a terrible cut. He had to go to urgent care after we got home because of swelling and extreme pain. It infected his finger and now has to take antibiotics. The sliding door is a terrible idea. We stayed at other hotels with slides doors that worked properly. This one at ParkMGM was not installed correctly and the design is terrible. The two bulging screws dug into the wall every time we closed the door. It won't stay closed most of the time. The gap between the handle the and edge of the door makes it easy for fingers to get jammed.
50,Beds were great! Check in and out with ease! Table games and slots paying out! Food was amazing! Easy walk to New York for more amazing food. Smoke free environment was the icing on the cake! Will come back again.
30,While the room was updated not very long ago it lacked comfort. Nice big shower but the room was an odd lay out with waisted space. Check in process took almost an hour. Elevator was slow and crowded.
40,Location is awesome being in the middle of everything. Very clean and smoke free so air quality is great. Security is good with the number of staff there. Mattress was very comfortable. I didn’t want to get up. I need to know where they buy their mattress
10,Room was not refreshed. We were away from 10 am til 10 pm and returned to find unmade beds trash not emptied and towels not changed Staff seemed unconcerned when we reported the condition of the room. We had to request a discount which I have not yet seen because we don’t a check out invoice  Yet.
40,We chose Park MGM specifically because it is non-smoking! We were not disappointed. There were no residual smoke odors anywhere we went. Also the Park Theatre is a great venue for shows and concerts.
40,Suite was perfect. Housekeeping after Covid takes alot to get used to. Not the same. Call if you would  Like new towels. Or your bed made. Mobile app needs to be redone never worked. Check in needs to be vastly improved
50,I really enjoyed my stay and despite the hiccups that came the Front Desk staff Housekeeping staff and Maintenance team was very pleasant. I would highly recommend this facility to family and friends visiting the Las Vegas area and I will definitely be back myself. 😍
50,We had a great stay at the Park MGM. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The parking was very close to our room. The Park MGM was very centralized on the strip and was very clean. I will be staying at the Park MGM for my future visits. Guaranteed.
50,Great experience. Friendly staff fast service. Clean. Already booking a trip back. Had a great time wasn’t to busy. A beautiful hotel and we had a great view. Ate near the pool food was fantastic. Just great experience over all.
40,The rooms were very attractive and roomy. For 3 ladies we had plenty of space. only thing missing were microwave mini refrigerator and coffee maker. Enjoyed the electronic key and webpage. I will enjoy this again soon.
40,Great staff. Not 5 stars because we did online checking we were put into a unsatisfacory room which had lots of stains in carpet and a low floor room with no view. Great Salon and non-smoking casino were big pluses
50,We had a wonderful time at the ParkMGM! Everyone we friendly. The room was excellent! And the smoke free environment was a appealing!! The restaurants were great with excellent food. And the location on the strip was perfect.
40,"Great stay for the Bruno Mars concert at The Park Theater!! We were celebrating our anniversary and was only in town for one night so didn't need the ""Whole Las Vegas Scene"" Excellent stay and we highly recommend!!"
30,First time staying here would stay again very clean and well taken care of. Gaming was fun very nice Casino wish you didn’t have to pay so much for valet service now a days and wish you could pay in cash not just a card.
10,If you like a hell vacation please go here and have a great time. The services is really poorly from top to the bottom. The manager is a lady she is very rude and look like a racist when I try to explained her the problem. She brushes me off like I was the complainer. I even shows her all the videos clips in the room. She don’t really care what I got to said to her. Beware for a hell week if you decide to go here. I recommend you stay at motel 6. The room are lots cleaner. The manager is a racist also! Beware! Good luck! And yes I loss $1500 at this hotel which is priceless. The service is all I care not the money.
40,I enjoy staying at the Park MGM. I hope they remain and expand their non-smoking location to downtown LV. The rates are a bit high considering that the city itself has yet to give me any business since 2020 and I have to pull money in from out-of-state. I hope this is just a temporary slow down within the hospitality and gambling industries and things return back to normal soon. I don't want to have to start looking at other places like Downtown Grand because it's further away from the NHL stadium but if they can offer a better environment I might make a move and return to Park for the steakhouse and the bar only.
20,Just a disappointing stay as far as food options were concerned. The staff appeared less than accommodating when it came to assisting me with food options for my gluten sensitivity. Staff knowledge of this was extremely lacking. I don't mind paying extra for food I can eat while on vacation but I do have a problem with the hotel staff specifically the concierge saying that there would be gluten free options and then up on arrival finding out that there's cross contamination everywhere and they don't guarantee anything. It's estimated that 6 to 7% of the US population has gluten sensitivity. Read the room Park MGM.
50,By far the best convenience to eventing on the strip! The location is superb. You are a walk away from everything. The bonus point the view adult atmosphere without major loud people nor fast food bars. It feels good to walk around in an non smoking casino
50,MGM Park was an excellent choice to stay in Las Vegas highly recommended  friendly staff clean place good rooms easy access and the best of everything FREE OF SMOKE!!!  definitively we are going to come back
30,The room hallways and elevators were nasty! Why is there piled trash in the elevators? Also the hallways had trash all day. Nobody is cleaning! This is a problem that a MGM shouldn't have. I will not stay here ever again.
50,In 2021 I feel all rooms need a fridge. But take that away and the hotel is top notch. The free monorail is an added bonus. My favorite part is having a target across the street for room snacks. Saves you from standing in line every day for a bottle of water or bag of chips.
40,The hotel is smoke free which is a huge plus. All of the staff were friendly and made sure that I was happy with my stay. The only issues that I had were that I received some towels that were dirty and they were old food crumbs and trash in the couch cushions. The food at Eately was average. The pizza was great but the pasta was bland. The breakfast was alright but I would not go out of the way for it. I will probably stay here again.
50,First time in Vegas. Did our homework regarding Casino's and overwhelmingly we wanted a clean smoke free environment. Shortly upon arrival we toured other Casino's to develop a comparison. It was evident Park MGM stood out. No smoking and very clean. Almost every other Casino/Resort we toured had a horrible smell and just felt worn. Not Park MGM. Staff were friendly. The Casino staff went above and beyond to make our experience Great. Thanks Park MGM. If you want a really nice enjoyable stay in Vegas then Park MGM is your place. Again First Time Stay. Hope to make it back with the goal to stay at Park MGM.
40,Just one the day they didn’t clean our room and still got charged for resort fee and about the restaurant well it was just luck that I trade food with my daughter “10 years old “ and then I found the foil wrap on her food
40,"Over the years we never stayed here. This time we chose Park MGM because it's where Bruno Mars was appearing. The front desk is more like in the back not unlike Flamingo and a few others. It was well organized but then it was after midnight. The check-in was done online so all I needed was to use my credit card and get our room keys. The room on the 6th floor wasn't bad. The view was of the back towards I-15. We could see the back of New York NY as well as others in a distance towards Rio and the Palms as well as the T-Mobile Arena. It was comfortable small with enough room to maneuver around each other without much problem. Very nice bed-nowadays we do 2-queen size beds when away from home. The bathroom was nice; no tub but a nice shower. My only problem was that there really isn't much of a vanity around the sink. It's still OK. As is consistent with most ""Strip Hotels"" there are no coffee makers no microwave and no refrigerators. Thankfully there was no wet-bar either. It was a nice two night stay. I will say that there are numerous dining options at the hotel most of which are at the other end of the casino closer to Las Vegas Blvd. (Starbucks is at the lobby end) There is a secret at this location. There is a Tram which runs between here and Bellagio with a stop at City Center."
40,Went during Mexico usa soccer game. Neighbors were noisy. They played Spanish music from 9am to 2 am and the walls are thin so you could hear all “activities” so I did not sleep well the first night but after they moved out everything was fine.
30,The Park MGM is in a great location and overall the cost/value was okay. Having said that for a little more I would stay at the Aria or Cosmopolitan. The gym at Park MGM was great. I was able to get my daily workouts without feeling that the space was overcrowded considering the covid environment.
50,I had the pleasure of staying at Park MGM the first week of August 21. The check in was easy and I loved the use of technology to assign my room and key. It's so modern up to date and convenient. Thank you.
20,"If it were not for the Joe Bonamassa concert I came to see I would check out and go somewhere else. I waited to check in for 20 minutes while people who were ""priority"" kept walking right up to the counter. REALLY??!! They couldn't have even one of the four hosts tend to the long line of people waiting to check in that were not ""priority"" - it does NOT encourage me to get a ""priority"" membership. It encourages me to go somewhere else. The room is seriously small there is no mini fridge the AC is weak and the resort fee is ridiculous. I came for a concert - not a spa! Will NEVER stay here again."
50,We had a great time. Excellent service since we got there. Easy access to everything and everything was clean; from the front desk to the rooms was cleaned. I really like this place. I do recommend this hotel.
40,Good location great staff and the guys in Valet are awesome! But they need to enforce COVID requirements and not be passive with those who don't follow the policy!! Don't be scared to tell those who refuse to wear a mask and rather spread their germs to wear the damn mask!!!
40,The hotel is very clean and nice lookingroom is comfortableonly one issue the closet is too small.And sliding door is annoyingwhen you need the closet to use  and someone needs to use a bathroom you have to be very careful because the door can hit you.
30,Mobile check in easy and convenient. However the digital keys do NOT work so we had to get a hard key. Rooms nice and clean. Bed comfy. Casino nice good location on the strip near lots of restaurants. The strip view from the room was whack.
40,We had a great time room was clean and easy to get to from most places on strip but lack of fridge or microwave made bringing food back problematic and the rates I received on the app isn't what I ended up paying for the room
50,The staff we’re friendly knowledgeable very clean hotel the rooms were spacious and well kept. Location was great as well as the restaurants. The casino was exciting the pools were nice and parking was easy.
40,This casino is a non-smoking casino and there are not many good restaurants inside but gambling here was very fun. I stayed for a night but I probably wouldn’t stay at this casino longer than a night.
50,Let’s start with non-smoking in Las Vegas! Winning! We went there because it was all non-smoking on the strip but to be honest the rest of the hotel experience was great. I also love their app based check-in and digital key… awesome!
40,Smoke-free environment is great. Good location and staff. Eataly options are great but were limited I assume due to staffing shortages related to the pandemic. WiFi is horrible and can’t be relied upon.
50,Super clean. Modern. A staff that takes ownership of your experience. Great restaurants and other amenities. Oh and don’t discount that it’s smoke free. Just a great place with a better than great staff
50,Love that park mgm is entirely smoke free ! Hotel was clean and it is very easy to get to the poolswhich are also lovely with plenty of seating. The location on the strip is perfect we will be staying here again for sure.
50,Food was amazing room was beautiful entertainment off the chain! The trip was a girl's weekend for me and my teenage daughter. She had a fantastic time! Highly recommend seeing a concert here as well. Not a bad seat in the house.
30,Over all a pleasant experience except they no longer let you combined Mlife comp night offers with MyVegas Free play is kinda unfair especially if they want you to spend your time and money on their game and in their casino when in vegas.
10,Staff treated me horribly slot machines were complete teases non stop masks provided were coated in ethylene oxide which triggered an allergic response from my dad and sent him to the urgent care along with an $800 bill. Not only will I not be staying at park mgm I will no longer visit ANY mgm resorts ever again
30,Casino is recommended for those who don’t smoke.  Not a sound proof since you can hear other people talking from the other room talking.  Bathroom faucet is noisy when draining water.    Nothing special that a family can explore in the hotel.
40,Convenient location for Bruno Mars concert. Best Friend Restaurant excellent. Did mobile check in and check out. Wish room had fridge microwave keurig! Elevators were fast. Loved my stay here!  MGM Grand right across street. Tons of eating places nearby. Love the non snoking casino and rooms!
10,Everything in this hotel is an up charge. No coffee makers or in room refrigerators are provided. They charge additional fees for any request. I requested a refund and was denied. Very disappointing for the cost of $1000. For 3 nights.
50,Overall stay was amazing my wife and loved the smoke free environment. The staff was amazing and very attentive to my condition being in a wheel chair as well as accommodating me at three of the restaurants on sites. Would highly recommend and I look forward to my next stay.
50,One of the best hotels I stayed In. It was a non smoking casino and hotel. Staff was so helpful with me and my family. The rooms where so clean and nice. The whole hotel was clean luxurious and fun at night while gambling. Had a great experience in Park MGM!
30,The hotel location is great I didn’t like Eatley the food court it was not my type of food. The MSU reason I would stay at this hotel is the room it was so outdated it was ridiculous. My ceiling light had a cord that ran across the ceiling into a plug on the wall.
20,If MGM would focus attention on updating their rooms ensuring housekeeping services occur daily and staff the front desk at check-in so the line isn't 100-people deep then I could rate the property higher. Unfortunately my July 2021 stay won't allow me to do that.
40,The Park MGM is a nice clean smoke-free hotel with a lovely pool area and awesome pool staff. However our air conditioner stopped working in the middle of the night...guest services said they would give us a $50 food and beverage credit for our uncomfortable night but the credit was not on our final bill. If it weren't for this error this stay would have been excellent.
30,We went for a girls trip and stayed at the park because of the price. The room was decent the view of the strip was underwhelming the shower had great pressure but the cabana rental at the pool was the best thing we did! If you are looking for a hotel that is on this strip but don't really care about the flashy Vegas experience this hotel is prefect. I really appreciated how close the parking garage was to the room portion of the hotel as well has how close the pool entry was to the rooms. I hate having to walk through Casinos in my swimsuit to get to a pool so this was perfect because the entry is close to the room elevators.
10,My daughter and I walked in to “our” room only to discover a couple having sex because they failed to give us an un-occupied room. We missed two diner reservations because it took over two hours to check in and management was rude discourteous and not helpful at all. When asked to speak to a supervisor I was told numerous times that there was no one higher than the person I was speaking to. They were more concerned with me not wearing mask and told me several times I was going to be escorted off the property by security instead of trying to accommodate my stay.
50,Great location! Perfect in size and amenities… not too big that you get lost in… layout very memorable.  Eataly is a great eat and meet place! Pool area nice. Spa area was very nice. Rooms clean and perfect.
10,My wife and I stayed at Park when it first opened. We LOVE MGM properties and we were looking forward to staying at the newly renovated Park MGM hotel. We had a great time watching Aerosmith loved all the dining options the hotel offered and felt at home in our immaculate hotel room.    Based on that experience we were eager to return. This time we brought family with us and we were all staying at Park. We were fortunate enough to get tickets for Bruno Mars-which was a great show-but the hotel had completely changed in a few short years. When we arrived we could still see visual traces of the previous occupants all over the bathroom (pubic hair everywhere). A strong cigarette smell lingered throughout the room like a guest who has overstayed their welcome and the AC in the room seemed to work only intermittently. We tried to order a movie from the video library but after spending the money on the video we found the equipment was not able to play the movie-yet we were still charged for it.    Still we tried to make the best of it and we quickly made our way to Lala Noodle with our family who had joined us on this trip. I had raved about the food at the restaurant based on our previous experience. After one bite I could tell this too had changed. The quality with which we had experienced on our last trip was no longer there. I quickly apologized to my family for recommending the place and paid for everyone’s meal. I also noticed that several of the dining options in the eatery area were not open-I assumed this was due to COVID.    I realize COVID plays a large role in some of these changes. I know companies have had to adjust because they just do not have the manpower they use to. On top of that I know there are other problems companies have had to tackle to continue to thrive. The issue for me is the what is being passed on to the consumer. At the moment Park MGM is charging first class prices for coach amenities.    With that said this review is in no way a “threat” to no longer stay at an MGM property. Quite the contrary actually. As I said in the beginning my wife and I love MGM properties and we both believe you will do what it takes to bring this property back up to the high standards you originally had for it. However until that happens I can’t in god conscious recommend this particular hotel.
40,Staff were very courteous and helpful! Especially the valet and bellhops! Loved the smoke free property! Best restaurant on the strip was Roy Choi’ Best Friend! I love there Garlic Chicken! It was the best!
30,The hotel was overall really nice great staff. Only issue was the Wi-Fi also they didn’t have a coffee maker fridge or microwave. If you don’t care for any of these things then it will be a great place for you to stay!
30,"Had kids with me and saw a ""stain"" on the couch from previous guests. Emailed and called concierge and did not get a response. I realize that rooms will not be perfect due track of personnel but this was un sanitary to find."
30,Room and hallways had poor air conditioning circulation. Very hot at times. Wouldn’t stay here again. Charge for late check out. Pool management not very friendly. Doesn’t know how to talk to paying guests.
50,From the parking area it is very easy to go to the hotel rooms. Nice theater too. We enjoyed the concert of Bruno Mars! If they have another shows that we would like to watch then we are definitely willing to flight back and try the other hotel rooms.
50,We very much enjoyed our recent stay at Park MGM. The location was great. The restaurants and bars on site were fantastic. The decor and theming throughout the resort was well done. Check in and check out were easy and the staff were friendly and accommodating. We will be back.
40,I have a problem with room service and I called three times to come and fix or clean my room and no one listen to me and I was on hold for almost 10 minutes and no one answer me that was my first time have problems at mgm
40,This was my first time staying at the Park MGM and I absolutely give them a thumbs up. Clean rooms friendly staff and the whole Casino is totally non-smoking! A big plus for me allowing me to play longer because I usually cut my playing time short due to getting irritated from smoke. Will definitely stay here again.
50,We’ve stayed at a number of the MGM hotels over the past few years. Although it’s not quite Aria it might as well be the next best thing. It’s a smoke-free casino there are three different pools to enjoy and the food is phenomenal.
10,"TLDR: Found a PILE OF HUMAN FECES (aka POOP please see attached photo evidence) in the closet after checking-in. Spent hours escalating the situation with massive pushback from the front desk with minimal reimbursement. Avoid this place at all costs.    I apologize in advance for the word vomit but I had probably the most surreal ridiculous negative hotel experience at Park MGM this past weekend; I still can't wrap my mind around it.    Upon checking in to the hotel we noticed a faint weird smell in the room almost like bad body odor or dried vomit. On further inspection we found a massive pile of human feces in the closet sitting right in the middle of the carpet. How could housekeeping have missed this blatant biohazard especially during COVID times with ""enhanced cleaning"" advertised everywhere on their website. Huge health hazard and ridiculous for the amount we paid for the room.    Alright so things happen I understand stuff fall through the cracks. BUT upon complaining over the phone to the front desk they offered a smacking 50 dollar food credit in return for the trouble of breathing in fecal matter spread all over the room by the AC. Further they claimed they had no more 2 queen bed rooms available for the day to transfer into and that we would just have to live in the feces room. It was the worst customer service we had ever experienced with any motel hotel or bnb. When we asked for a refund for the room which was beyond reasonable given the ridiculous situation they refused stating that we had already spent a day in the room. When we finally asked to speak to a manager we were told ""the manager is on the floor and you can come down to speak with him if you want."" Why the manager could not be bothered to speak with us over the phone to discuss why a MOUND OF HUMAN EXCREMENT was not cleaned up is still incomprehensible to me.    After spending hours waiting in the check-in line downstairs we finally managed to speak to a manager who only removed the resort fees and gave a discount for ONE NIGHT ONLY. Absolutely ridiculous. Oh and they ""conveniently"" managed to find another open 2 queen bed room after we showed up in person to complain. So not only had they LIED to us about being booked up they continued to refuse to reimburse us fully for finding a STACK OF POOP uncleaned. At this point we were exhausted and tired of the gaslighting that the front desk had put us through so we took the minimal reimbursement and transferred.    I'm almost laughing as I type this review. I understand businesses can have bad days and that's alright but this abysmal experience has made me passionate enough to inform others about avoiding this place at all costs. Spend your hard-earned money and limited vacation days at a non-MGM property where they actually value customer service. If you enjoy arguing with a multi-billion dollar resort company about reimbursing you a few hundred bucks for a finding a STACK OF HUMAN FECAL MATTER left over from the previous guest then this place fits the bill."
30,Room was nice and clean bed was comfy. My complaint is that there was no coffee maker fridge or microwave in the room. We could live without the microwave but not the other two. Another reason for the 3 star rating was that once you got off the elevator to go to your room you get a terrible smell of musty old carpeting and the lights were so dim you could hardly see. I was afraid to walk to my room by myself. Creepy. Weird that they renovated the rooms but not the hallways.
40,We stayed here for two nights. The service at the restaurant could use some improvement. The rooms are really small but they are ok. The best thing about the hotel is the non-smoking casino. We might be back.
40,Felt like we got our money’s worth staying here. Hotel is in great location to/on the strip very clean in all areas of building. We really liked our room layout. Vibe of hotel is a little lower key than some of the other spots on the strip. Hotel staff was friendly and easy checkout process.
40,Best friends has great tacos and fries and their breakfast restaurant by the front desk is ok but overpriced for what you get  Eataly is good food as well. Love that its non smoking in the Park MGM....
50,I enjoyed my stay at Park MGM. Even though the room did not have a microwave or mini fridge (fridge rental available but it should be free) I will still give 5 stars because of staff location and overall experience plus I won a little money at the Casino.
40,My family of 3 stayed here for 2 nights in June. Appreciated the smoke free building especially after walking through New York New York which smelled so bad. Truly that bumps this from average to very good in my book!    Hall ways are dark -- typical Vegas so you don't know what time it is! No coffee/tea in the room so be prepared if your morning coffee is important to you. Limited storage for clothing. Our room was clean. Beds were a little soft for my daughter but fine for hubby and I. there was a cushioned bench seating area along the window comfortable for sitting along with a small table that could seat 2 or 3 people. No dressers -- a shelf that runs a good length of the wall under the tv with a few hooks underneath for hanging clothing items or bags. Storage definitely lacking - not even enough places to hang your towels after showering. We ended up using hangers in the tiny closet for our damp towels.    The pool area was very happening with young adults -- very party kind of atmosphere. We only walked through didn't stay to swim.    Resort staff were friendly we opted for key cards instead of just using the app and they were helpful in directing us. We got coffee in Eataly both mornings -- your only other choice is starsucks...no thanks. Lots of food options in the Eataly food court and plenty of seating.    Easy access to New York New York Excalibur and areas of the strip though if you want to get to the main part grab a taxi. It's a bit of a walk.
30,The digital key does not work for elevator access toilet was dirty when we came into our room video play back for movie rental didn’t work as it supposed to. It would pause and play at times or turn off
40,Nice hotel very friendly. Enjoyed our stay. Love that casino is smoke free. Excellently placed on the strip to walk to most hotels. Italian food court / restaurants (Eataly) is awesome. Rooms are comfortable with nice bathrooms and a family friendly feel. Would visit again!
20,It’s whack pretty much casino is small and tight check in sucks beds are extremely low hall ways look like dark alleys not enough bars or restrooms… over all it’s whack but if they give you free rooms I suppose it’s worth the stay
30,We loved being close to Eatliy and all the staff we met in person were helpful and friendly however this hotel advertises itself as pet friendly and isn't really. Park MGM charges $100/night for a pet (with same Vegas bed tax rate on top of that) and there are no pet amenities except for some shiny bowls brought to the room on request. Dogs are required to be crated if left alone in the room but there are no crates to rent and the concierge could not be bothered to help us find someplace that rents them. Pet potty area is just a tiny triangle of hot fake grass surrounded by asphalt. Room was nice and bed comfortable but common areas and hallways ready for an update already. Casino was fine and less crowded than Aria but we liked variety of slots at Aria better.
40,Refreshing change of pace in Las Vegas more relaxing vibe. Location makes it easy to navigate. Non smoking and hotel is a nice manageable size. Nice park like setting right across from hotel. Recommend this location.
50,Great time staff extremely friendly. Beautiful non smoking property loved the view from our room. Definitely will stay there again. Liked that we can enjoy all the MGM properties and dining. Casino was alot of fun. I wish they would have a $5 tables
50,The Nightingale Suite is perfect to come home to at night after you tired from dining shopping and gaming. We love Eataly Food Hall I'm a foodie and the food selections are excellent! Although not stalls are open we did enjoyed lunch with our friends.
40,The beds we slept in were a little lumpy and uncomfortable. Probably need to change the mattresses. Food are a bit pricey otherwise the rest of our stay was nice we had a total of 5 rooms (12 people). Staff were all great.
10,Hoping an upgrade to a suite to a more comfortable stay but to find out the suite was VERY dusty and filthy. There were no fridge and microwave appliances. Despite COVID 19 we disinfected the entire room with Clorox. Paying for an upgrade to dust and clean it ourselves in order to feel clean and safe. The carpet looked dirty inside and outside the room floor. The sinks were also dirty. Lastly the upgrade daily fee and tax were not informed. The refreshments charges were not noted nor how it would be charged if touched or moved. We ended up charged $14 for a simple Oreo (3 times more) $14 for a regular Pringle (3 times more and $18 for a regular size of cashew (3 times more) !!
50,Best location on the strip! Great non-smoking casino with fabulous restaurants and bars hidden throughout. Staff is friendly and professional. Hotel and casino are spotless! Do yourself a favor and don’t stay anywhere else!
40,Best hotel I have stayed in Vegas. Clean to perfection. Lots of outlets everywhere in the room so very convenient. Perfect location. Just be aware that bathroom door doesn't have a lock and there is no refrigerator on room.
40,Park MGM had a nice theme and decor. Good location but rooms could use some improvements. The staff were very friendly throughout the hotel. The fitness center is great! It’s very big for a hotel gym. One downside was that the pasta at Eataly was so salty but we were too hungry to make a fuss. The pool should be open later 7pm is too early. Overall Park MGM is a good value stay but don’t expect too much from the room.
50,We loved how clean and spacious our room was. The decor was GREAT. This was Smoke Free facility. We really enjoyed the pools (3). Staff was very courteous and professional. Loved the decor and food selection at Eataly. We also had a SPECTACULAR dining experience at La La Noodles. Chef AJ Ang created an special 5-course meal for our family. Every dish was spectacular.
30,Room was Terrible. Felt like a dungeon. Sink was clogged room was smelly and sheets were stained. Staff was zero help. It used to be Monte Carlo which was a dump. Thought maybe they would give it a full facelift but really they just threw on some paint and carpet and called it a day. Really bummed.
40,Our stay was nice but there were some slight issues with our room and accommodations. The location is great and has easy access to MGM grand as well as the New York New York. We enjoyed the close proximity & eataly.
30,I used the digital key check-in. The digital key did not work very well. The Hilton digital key works much much better. I struggled to get the room or elevator door to read the key on my phone. The room smelled strongly of cigarette smoke which I thought was supposed to be smoke free. The room was rather dated and the bed seemed worn out. It was mashed pretty bad on one side and too soft for me. The bathroom was pretty nice however. As for the food Eately was nice and the Primrose bar was great for breakfast although the prices are astronomical (which is common for everything on the strip.) I found it funny that the resort fee was the same price as the room. The pools were ok but rather small. Nice in the mornings before the drunks wake up. Overall I would say the hotel was adequate and met my needs..
30,They checked us into a dirty room. Had to drag our luggage back down to get another room. The hallways and elevator areas looked like they haven’t been cleaned or vacuumed in months. The staff and the service was excellent but I guess I was expecting an upgrade for the inconvenience.
40,This hotel is completely smoke free. Casino smells so nice. Eatally restaurants are very good and prices are reasonable. The nighthawk suite we had was very spacious but furnitures looked dated. Hallway carpet looked dated.
50,Loved that there was no smoking anywhere in the hotel or casino. The pool was fun to lounge in. There was only one Pai Gow table open so it was usually full but still a ton of fun. Rooms are small (as the building is old) but felt well updated furnishings-wise.
50,The Park was very clean and smelled great being a non-smoking property. If I were to suggest anything it would be to make every door an automatic opening door so that door wouldn’t have to be opened if unaware of sensors.
50,It's my third time at this hotel and I like service attention especially food at restaurants Eataly. I love is smoke free. This time I have the opportunity to enjoy the pool very clean spacious.  Room clean peaceful.
50,This was our first time staying at Park MGM. We were happy to find the entire facility was non-smoking. The food and restaurant choices were fun. And the rooms and casino were clean and fresh. The usual table games as well as the slot machines can be found easily. We will be coming back to Park MGM on our next Las Vegas trip.
50,my wife and I had a wonderful experience and we really enjoyed the time at the Park! The food service at the restaurants in the hotel were exceptional to the point that we didn't eat anywhere away from the hotel first time ever! Room was very comfortable and we felt spoiled!
50,Great place to stay and play hotel was clean room was clean service was outstanding I can't believe how clean and friendly the staff was they are doing great things don't wait book now!!! You will love it
20,I had really bad experience and Not happy at all. The host from reservations sucks Mlife sucks and have really bad attitude they got a wrong day 3 different times . I was on the phone for 3 hours and had to drive down to check in . Didn’t get to check in til 11ish pm
50,Great service great workers great bartenders great staff at the mlife section. I will definitely keep staying at Park MGM for the service I was giving this past weekend. Thank you very much team! AG
50,The park is in one of the best Las Vegas locations and everything is a short walk. The staff is great and helpful. The check in is so fast on the app you never have to come into contact with any one. Rooms are clean and neat.
40,Everything there was great some of my family went to more expensive Hotels that was just a name didn't even enjoy there stay for double the price smh but lmao. I would definitely go back maybe even upgrade into a bigger room then before Thanks Park MGM.
40,We had a great first trip to Las Vegas staying at Park MGM. We chose the property because of it being smoke-free and this was a big plus. The only negative in our experience was the lack of beverage service in the Casino. We checked in on Friday around noon and and Friday through Sunday I was only asked if I wanted something to eat twice. Monday was much better though.
40,Nice casino/hotel and great selection of food not to mention it's a fabulous location! You're able to catch the tram to go to Bellagio and Aria and walk across the street to New York New York. You must stay here at least once and I bet you'll be back.
30,i know that the hotel are not 100% staffed yet and unfortunately you can tell same trash on the floor by the elevators for 2 days. And even thou I move to a different room the bed was still very uncomfortable. Felt like I was sleep on a hard floor our outdoors. Good thing I has a couch was much better.
40,No smoky stinky casino. Rooms were better than I expected. Gambling there really sucks as the machines are very tight. The Mlife staff are very friendly and accommodating. Casino is much better than before when it was the Monte Carlo. They upgraded to a classier casino
50,Wonderful casino and resort  I have no complaints  Staff was great. Room was very clean  I will definitely come back and stay with them again. I love it there. One of the best hotels to stay at on the strip.
50,Our stay at Park MGM was exceptional. We had a great experience from the start and we're excited to come back in the coming months. We had a great time gambling and enjoyed the atmosphere of the casino and we were extremely grateful for the staff members.
50,Clean great location fantastic atmosphere. My family and I really enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend this hotel/casino to our friends and family. We will definitely be back to stay and enjoy this location again in the near future.
10,The rooms were not clean and had minimum amenities - not even a microwave. The staff was rude  we had booked room with view and when we checked in late in the night ( had informed we will reach late) - we were told that rooms are not available and we should not expect rooms with view anymore. We were made to wait and on insisting that we did pay extra for rooms with view  we were finally provided one. The staff behavior at front desk was condescending as if they are doing a favor by giving us a room we booked by paying close to $300 a day ( not the usual cheap rates). There was a total lack of customer delight or experience on the contrary the front desk staff behaved really rudely. The carpets across hallway & rooms were not clean the wash basin was jammed up and so many untidy things across the room/hotel which did not deserve the $300 per night price tag. I would any-day suggest a hotel far away from the strip but with better rooms amenities and customer experience. Give this one a pass despite all the hype. Get this they even do not provide a bottle of complimentary water - pay $5 for that at the vending machine.
50,Only interacted with front desk great service hotels clean rooms clean and access to surroundings central to most of what’s on the strip. Good trip when you don’t have to interact with much of the staff.
20,the common areas casino and food options are amazing. the renovation was a huge success in these areas. but the rooms are awful. stay somewhere else and visit this resort unless you want to stay in an old room that has barely been updated. and has ZERO dressers or drawers for you to unpack your clothes into. shameful!
40,Although many restaurants I wanted to go during the day were not open I was pleased with everything else especially the non smoking part. Very refreshing I might add. Also being comped a room with rewards is also an inviting feature
50,It was nice going to Las Vegas and staying in a smoke free Hotel. The staff was very friendly and courteous and the rooms were very clean. I will definitely stay here again on my next trip back to Vegas.
40,Definitely stop by the Park MGM on your next rip to Vegas! Great location non-smoking lots of food and gambling options. The tram makes it easy to access other hotels and lots within walking distance
50,My husband and I were in Vegas a couple of weeks ago staying at a different hotel but on our very last evening we had dinner reservations at Bavette’s Steakhouse. How I wish we would have stayed at the Park MGM! We had not been to this hotel since it was the Motecarlo in which we had stayed a few times. We decided to get to the hotel early before our dinner reservations to look around to check out all the new changes and we immediately loved what we saw. Everything has been nicely remodeled and we really like the newly updated pool area too. When we got to the pool area we were greeted by two friendly security gentlemen “Dee and Hank Graae”. They were nice enough to let us check out the pool area and they gave us a lot of great information about the hotel and places to eat and they even gave us a discount card to use at Bavettes Steakhouse. Oh and we had great experience and Bavettes too. The food was delicious our steaks were cooked to perfection and the serving staff was super friendly and accommodating. I can go on and on! Let me just say when we go back to Vegas we are definitely  going to stay at the Park MGM!
40,Wanted to try the revamped Monte Carlo. Check went smoothly. all promotions were on my account. Good location to walk and visit( and playif you choose) at multiple casinos. This casino needs more blackjack tables and more video poker. Clean good value.
40,Thanks for the great room but watch the dealers. I got ripped off but didn’t realize till to late to contest it. Dealers seem new so maybe that was the issue. Room was nice and rest of staff also. But the inexperienced dealers were not a plus.
50,Highly recommend this place the rooms are spacious and clean hallways are not noisy at all and it was not crowded in the casino. I will definitely stay here again on my next staycation. Easy to access front desk from guest parking and guest elevators are a short walk from front desk and garage parking too.
10,Room was not clean when we checked in. Children at all hours of day and night around the resort who were not behaving. Young adults who were not physically impaired driving around on scooters with no regard of others. The staff was friendly and that was the only bright spot I will not return to this property for an overnight stay. Common areas were also not vacuumed during the whole stay and the elevators appeared to have not been cleaned either.
50,"This is a very clean Hotel and Casino. Smoke -free helps. The beds are very comfortable. It would have been nice to be on a ""kid free"" floor but we're used to kids screaming and the related noise of vacationing families."
20,They need to rerenovate the rooms. Old carpet and smelly.They tax you 3 times on products and service. No consistentcy in any answers to your your questions .No one seemed to care or make us feel welcomed.
50,Asked for a room with a view and got a room on the 21st floor with a pool view. Away from the elevator. Was able to check in around 9 A.M. well before the usual 3 P.M. check in times. Checking out was easy as well. Would recommend!
50,The pool staff was extremely accommodating. The entire property  is a smokeless environment. The food was as good as any other higher priced hotel and the location is the best on the strip. It's a no brainer DO IT!
30,Right on the strip. Good location. Rooms are small and you can hear people in adjacent rooms and hallways. Dining options are good. Disappointed about having to pay for parking many hotels have free parking. Beds are comfortable.
30,Hotel needs to change carpet vacuum clean  shampoo.  Hallway elevators filthy smelly. Rooms are loud noisy bathroom door poorly designed as well as the sink.  Security needs to be a little faster for complaints. Housekeeping for request needs more time improvement Rooms needs to be shampoo and vacuuming. Couch. Table are dirty and dusty.
50,Great family trip. Something to do for everyone. Good location friendly staff and very clean and safe environment! The dining was great. Steakhouse is a must. And the Eatery has a nice variety. We will definitely return.
10,Although the price was good the staff was less than friendly and property needed some serious remodeling. Room was hard to find and signs not clear. Staff not very willing to help find anything. Probably will not be staying here again.
30,The Park MGM room need to be clean. The rug had spots all over it. When you need to put your stuff away. You get 2 little draws to put stuff in. No alarm clock in the room. The iron had rust in it. What is the $39.00 resort fee for. The minibar stand was sitting with nothing in it. Then its $15.00 for parking. Just put all of your fees in the room when you book it.
30,Nothing spectacular. Average Vegas casino hotel. No late night food option or early morning option either. The mobile check in and out was the best part. The part where you had to use your phone for the elevator access was hit or miss it became annoying when it took multiple attempts to get the elevator to operate. Location is cool.
50,My first time darting at park MGM . It was just one night but staff friendliness and cleanliness was outstanding I’m a season ticket holder for the raiders and will come back again and will definitively stay here
50,MGM park was a great value and great stay. The staff was great! The women at the front desk when i checked in went above a d gave me a strip view. When i arrived they unloaded my vehicle and brought all my stuff to the room for us. I would highlt recomment MGM park
50,Great experience and Fantastic Customer service. Love the location and everything that is available around the hotel. From the cleanliness of the rooms delicious breakfast delivered humbled and professional customer service( valet bell desk room service easy mobile check-in).
30,The rooms aren’t 100% doesn’t look like a full remodel from Monte Carlo very half assed. Shower has ultra high pressure with no way to change it the sink doesn’t drain fast enough so it builds up and makes a pond there’s this weird “tv case” that’s very tacky and should be removed the drapes are both manual and the lamp needs to be replaced… super old and looks like a fire hazard.
40,The room was clean and comfortable everyone helpful. Technology for digital key could be better. The pools are large and beautiful. Services poolside also great. Lots of parking. Would like a mini bar though
50,I like Park MGM. It's a non-smoking hotel. All staff were so nice. Room wasn't luxury but it was comfortable. No mini fridge. What's so convenient is that you can get from point A to point B quickly.
40,The stay was good . The hotel is very nice and great food on premises although No refrigerator in the room and parking is very expensive. Some of the best hotels have free parking which is a perk for returning
10,It was a solo and family trip. Family and I met up in Las Vegas Nevada for my belated birthday remembering my cousin their sister who died of COVID. Her birthday is the day after mine. The valet hotel services where horrible and the Supervisors were micro aggressive and nonaccomodating. I moved to the Excalibur unfortunately MGM owns the majority of the casinos in Vegas
50,Only non-smoking property on the Strip. Excellent room value but no desk makes for a bit of creativity in the room. Friendly staff across the board. Eataly is fun and has multiple choices for all budgets and Bavette’s is a step back in time and is the best steakhouse in America.
20,room and pool were dirty trash everywhere staff ignored it. plastic cups floating on the pool. food containers and used towels in the sitting area.. i am requesting my money back.i only stayed 1 night moved to another hotel
50,The room was spacious and nicely decorated. The hall ways were clean and updated. The parking/valet was not too far from the hotel elevators which is nice when you are seniors. Modern atmosphere with friendly and efficient staff.
50,Room was very nice & clean great shower pressure front desk staff was excellent. Price was good conveniently located on the strip by everything. Everyone was very accommodating and the service was great.
10,The Park MGM is a poorly renovated dated facility with little to no staff a reliance upon its location to an event venue for visitors and a disappointing space in the glitz that is Vegas. Unless the room is basically free Vegas is otherwise full or you must be by the venue find other lodging. They should have leveled the facility and begin fresh perhaps that would have handled the smell of raw sewage that permeated our room.
50,The stay here was perfect from check in to housekeeping to food to staff at players club and even check out!! Amazing place and non smoking property makes it even better!! If you want a good clean place to go with the friendliest staff then go to Park MGM.
50,We had a great time everyone was really friendly and helpful if needed. Security Hank gave us a gift certificate for dinner for my fiancé’s birthday which was July 22nd. I would really recommend this hotel!
20,Rooms did not meet my expectations. Front desk and hotel staff addressed my concerns in a timely manner. Bathroom sink had permanent stains. Hotel room decor lacked diversity. Overall the room did not meet my expectations.
50,We wanted to try the Park for the pool area and a different experience. We were very satisfied with everything from friendliness service accommodations and layout of casino floor to give distances to all guests.
10,The Park MGM is so much worse than the old Monte Carlo. Dirty hallways tiny rooms horrific decor uncomfortable beds and pillows…just awful. Unbelievably the TV was on the wall at a 90 degree angle from the foot of the bed. Huh? It made no sense.  And the cherry on top was that Housekeeping never even came to make up our room.  If you’re looking for a nice place to stay in Las Vegas this ISN’T it.
50,Would definitely recommend Park MGM if you go visit Las Vegas! Easy self checked in and out easy access to self parking garage clean rooms housekeeping are great and very accommodating. Staff are friendly. You should visit Eataly good food!
50,What a great experience the hotel is very clean and up to date with a 40's vibe that I loved. Some restaurants weren't open when I was there but with Aria connected and NYNY literally across the street I never wanted. being smoke free is such a huge plus. The pools are good sized to match the number of rooms. If you go to the pools look for Alex and she'll take are of your needs.
50,I would definitely recommend staying here. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The rooms were clean and comfortable. I’ve been to Vegas a few times and this has been one of the better hotels I’ve stayed in.
50,I've been to this hotel before and once again it was a great experience. This go round I was able to partake in the happy hour which was awesome and yummy. It's a very neutral spot on the strip. Kiosks check in is a win! The line always seem to be long but I've never had to wait using the kiosks
50,From the moment you walk In smelled really good no cigarettes smell at all. Checkin process was easy and fast through the app. Check out was also easy and fast. The tag is very friendly and welcoming. Definitely will be staying here again.
40,"I chose the PARK MGM because it is advertised as the only non-smoking hotel and casino on the Strip. True to its word the hotel is non-smoking as is all the gaming tables. The bed was very nice and the property also contains a wonderful food experience called ""Eataly"" where we had a pleasant Italian Marketplace experience."
40,The stay was OK. Very hard to get any help with rooms/front desk/players club. Loved that this was a non-smoking hotel.  No food really after 10pm. Only valet was quick and helpful. I am hoping that this is because it's hard to get staff now. I will give it another try.
50,Stay was stressless pet friendly hotel.. so covenient for pet owner who can’t leave their fur babies behind while vacationing… specially when going to las vegas.as long as pet owner keep their pets in a stroller they can roa m around the hotel.
10,This place has really gone down hill. Rooms stink and at night it seems like ladies of the night are out and about in the hallways. Don’t just believe me read reviews on other sites…. Look up some reviews on yelp. They don’t lie.
10,I am aware that people make mistakes. However the manager Jacqueline made one that ruined my entire stay. When I checked in my card was left on file with a $400 hold. I am aware this is routine however without permission my card was ran for an additional $432. As a result I was forced to spend no fewer than 5 hours of my vacation trying to fix the situation. I’m aware that mistakes happen however instead of admitting to it Jacqueline belittled me spoke over me and blamed her staff vs taking ownership. As a result she single handedly ruined my experience.
40,The room wasn’t as clean as always. They brought some other guest on the second day of my stay but I booked two nights. They enter the room without asking a permission. Will not stay there at least next time.
50,The Park MGM always offers one of the best experiences on the strip. Centrally located with beautiful rooms and fine dining it offers a full complement of gaming. We particularly enjoy the smoke free environment. No messy ashtrays and plenty of clean fresh air.
20,We have been to this hotel multiple times and these last few times the cleanliness of the rooms and AC have gone down. The carpet was dirty had several  Stains one of the pillows had a stain on them and had to request for room to be cleaned.
30,Nice location on the strip. Just didn't feel special at all. Felt like it was trying really hard to be Bellagio. The Contactless Check In/Check Out was pretty nifty. Simple floor layout. Minimal wait for cabs.
50,Our room was extremely clean the hotel staff was very accommodating and friendly. The staff went all out for my mothers 60th birthday she enjoyed every moment. I can't much else other than it was great! We will be back!
50,We had a great time at the Park MGM the fact of the smoke free environment and the great staff in all the departments made our trip very pleasant great restaurants we loved the slots great variety our room was clean and fresh very important they followed the CDC guide lines making us comfortable and able to enjoy our stay. We loved the place
50,Perfectly clean room always saw staff cleaning everyone very friendly and all needs were met. The only complaint is that I’d like a fridge so much food it would’ve been nice for a place to leave leftovers instead of them going bad.
50,great room! the bed & pillows were absolutely amazing! although hot tub was cold & staff at pool never came by for us to order! when we got the bar food it was plenty & good! bartender was super nice & quick service!
20,The check-in was long and slow; not enough available staff. The room looked like the bed and table (no desk) was dropped in. Several days in a row housekeeping stated the ran out of wash clothes; I inquired at different times. Hallways and elevators were very hot. Very dim lighting in hallways. A total disappointment.
10,A/C takes a long time to cool the room. Bathroom sink was dirty. No refrigerator in the room you have to depend on ice or walk down to the casino for anything cool. Walls are VERY VERY thin. You could hear everything anyone was doing upstairs and in the rooms next to you.
50,Best part of this hotel was being able to check in early on the app and being able to get key card on your phone. Also smoke free casino/hotel was very nice. Didn't worry about smelling like smoke when we checked out. Also rented a Pool cabana which was great. Definitely recommended book in advance and enjoy the pool and poolside service.
40,It was alright for a one night stay. The rooms can use an upgrade. The AC was nowhere to be found. The room was kind of hot. Overall I give it a good stay for just one night. The staff was friendly and attentative
40,The best part of this hotel is the location and the fact that it is non-smoking. The outlets in the hotel were ok not a lot of options so we left the hotel to eat everyday. Our cabana had a non-working refrigerator the cushions were dirty and stained. On the plus side I did like that the pool area felt family friendly. We had a suite it was a good size.
30,Overall Resort is a great value. Large casino beautiful lobby nice pool area with bar and eataly is a great perk.    Rooms left a little to be desired. No fridge or microwave. Room seemed warmer than thermostat read. Hallways were dimly lit and somewhat unwelcoming.    Also if you are staying with a group make sure you are on the same floor.
50,Love the location and the staff. The rooms are nice and clean. No smoking casino is a nice break from all the smoke everywhere else. It has a tram that will take you to Belagio casino. The valet is quick helpful and friendly
50,Refreshing to not smell like an ash tray after being in the casino. Really enjoy where the Park MGM is located. A couple minute walk to New York New York and connected to the Aria. Plenty of great food options between the three properties.
50,From the eclectic decor to the comfortable cabanas to the clean and nice rooms this hotel really is a well-kept secret. They did not charge extra for 2 queen beds the bathrooms are clean and very nice and the Primrose is an excellent place for breakfast with good food and service.
40,Nice hotel non smoking in the entire facility is really great. Check in could be improved. Most of the updates from the old Monte Carlo are nice. Could use a few more lower end food choices and a faster coffee service since no coffee maker in room Starbucks at elevator exit was always packed and slow anytime before noon.
20,It was our anniversary and honeymoon after covid last year. We were excited to get away. We were hoping that the hotel was better kept updated and had more restaurant choices. We were disappointed across the board from the room condition and the overall appearance of the hotel.
40,Good descent place to stay and play. Loved the smoke free facility. MGM’s food and drink (outside of comped drinks) are ridiculous… $18 for a glass of mediocre white wine coffee for two consists of waiting over 30 minutes in line so you can spend $25 on 2 coffees 😳😡
30,Room was a little dated. It was small but clean. I would recommend this hotel but it is not an elite place to stay just average. The location is nice but all services. Make sure not to use ATM unless you want to pay $8.00 withdrawal fee. You can't get a free drink at the bar without using a players card.
40,I really like that it was in a central location. Things to do anywhere you went. The park like theme was executed to the fullest. I really enjoyed all the dining options healthier than most other resorts.
50,Casino is always clean and best part is it is non smoking. you do not walk to the room smelling like an ashtray. Eataly never disappoints! Everything there is amazing! Go to LaLa Noodles try the Oxtail fried Rice!
40,I would return to Park MGM if only to have the experience of being in a completely non-smoking casino rooms and restaurants. I didn't utilize the pool area but could see many people out there despite the extreme heat. Lots of nice places to eat easy parking and a free tram that goes to the Cosmopolitan and Bellagio which we did use to get a chance to see the Bellagio Conservatory. The rooms were nice but be prepared for no real closet or dresser drawer area. We stayed in a Stay Well Room which was super quiet and had a foam bed so very comfortable.
20,This hotel is one of the cheaper ones on the strip. But still expensive nonetheless. The rooms are nice but there isn't a fridge or microwave in there ( they could afford this amenity). There isn't enough staff working at a time no one is available to help. I was on the phone on hold with the bell desk for half an hour waiting for a luggage cart (I had a ton of luggage) and no one ever answered. I would overall expect more from a hotel like this.
50,The remolded resort is great We really like that is is a Non-smoking resort we wish all MGM properties were non-smoking. Casino was really fun with the 15 blackjack tables. The resort has a lot of choices of restaurants for anyone's appetite.
50,We had the opportunity to drive to Las Vegas for a short mini-vacation and had an awesome experience staying at Park MGM - from the easy check in app to the spacious room to friendly staff -- our time at the Park was grand!
50,We come here all the time because it is right in the middle of the best venues. And we like the Italian atmosphere. The food is great. The play is good here.The rooms are nice. Its close to all the good shopping too. Love coming here. We will be back as always.
30,This was my first time staying at the Park MGM. My expectations were a lot higher than what I personally experienced. The staff was friendly and helpful. Overall the service was excellent at Eataly Table Games and Hotel Staff. Although my only issue was the cleanliness of the hotel side of things which I expected more. If that was better I would maybe give a 4 star rating.
30,I stayed here over 4th of July weekend so my review of this hotel is through a pandemic/post-pandemic lens. I stayed in a Park MGM Two Queen Room that faced the T-Mobile Arena. I'm not sure if the lighting is the same for all of the towers but the walk from the elevator to our room is filled with dark and moody lighting. I get that it's supposed to have this NY feel walking through the park but it felt more like they were hiding the dirt. There was a bandaid on the carpet and the trash can by the elevator lobby was overflowing.    Our room had some sticky little spots on the table and blonde hair all over the loveseat located under the window (none of us are blonde). We called housekeeping they came up quickly cleaned the spot on the table and wiped down the couch. The supervisor comped us $25 each for use at any of the restaurants in the hotel/room service. We later used this for breakfast which was probably the highlight of our stay at this hotel because it was fantastic.    For a room that's meant to house 4 guests there is very little counter space and space overall to put your clothes and luggage. There was no mini-fridge so I was thankful I brought a small ice chest. The ice machine was our friend.    One night we found ourselves on our way back from a club around 3 am and there was absolutely nothing open for us to eat. The security in the elevator lobby suggested we go to NY NY next door to find food. I saw this as a missed opportunity to cash in on the hungry and wary clubgoer/gambler slinking their way back to their room.    However I learned by the end of the trip via our exploration of other hotels that Vegas is still struggling to deal with finding the labor to meet the crowd's expectations. We asked the front desk for late check-out and they informed us that the hotel was at capacity and late check-out would not be an option. At least two restaurants we visited prefaced our stay with the caveat that they were understaffed and asking for patience. This is understandable.    For the first full capacity weekend in quite some time Vegas still has a lot to deal with before it returns to the Vegas we all remember pre-pandemic.
50,I had an excellent time with my husband at this hotel! It is smoke free they have quality beds and pillows the food at Eataly is excellent and the tram was very convenient to use. Their customer service was always available. The check in and check out process was a breeze!
10,My husband and I have stayed here before and we loved it. Unfortunately this visit over the weekend was horrible. The entire floor and our room smelled like weed. This is supposed to be a non smoking hotel. We only stayed there one night.
40,Service was great. The hallways leading to rooms were very dark and carpet needed vacuuming. We very disappointed that there was no small refrigerator in our room. We brought bottled water thru the very hot dessert to keep us well hydrated and had no place to cool them.
50,Wonderful time neat and cleanstaff very helpful. Smoke free is the best room smell fresh.casino floor no one blowing snake in your face. Eataly great food . Highly recommend for anyone who going to Vegas
50,We love the Park. It is smoke free (which we love because we travel with 2 kids). The pools are great parking is easily accessible. Good options for food and drinks. The casino is not too crowded so it makes gambling more enjoyable.
50,Love this hotel. Perfect size. All new clean bright modern. Rooms are up to date. Amenities are all great. Casino non-smoking which is wonderful. Love Eataly. We were at an Eataly in Germany and fun to be at one here in the states.
40,My room had a great view. I was able to sleep in and relax. Room service was great. I ordered lunch and dinner through room service. The food was delicious and the service was great. On a different day I dined at the restaurant Eataly. It was delicious too.
50,Highly recommend the Park MGM Las Vegas for your next conference. The staff is incredible. They are very professional and will make your next event the best one you will ever have!! The rooms and restaurants are top notch
50,Park MGM is a great hotel but a lot of things are still closed like Mamma Rabbit and Manzo in Eatly. Also we booked a king room but were give a double queen room instead. Host said it was better but is wasn’t.
10,The staffing on the bar area and also in restaurants were refusing to give cups of water ice or even just a cup for free  one of the bartenders in the middle of the casino had a altercation with my dad where the cup of ice was dirty my dad NICELY asked for a new cup that wasnt diry and the bartender threw the cup of ice across the room full of people and onto the casino floor. The restaurants staff hardly attend to you while at the restaurant and only have one waiter for the whole restaurant. The hotel is smoke free but online the designated smoking areas will still get you told you cannot smoke there. The vending machines are broken so you are forced to buy the FIJI water and DASANI two of the dirtiest water are $10 a bottle understandble because we are on the strip but if you do not buy the water you will get dehydrated because nobody will give you a cup of just water and ice.
50,Miko at front desk was awesome. He went out of our way to accommodate my request to have my 2 rooms next to each other or at least on the same floor. I appreciated it so much. He even assisted us with our parking. The rooms were clean and comfortable.
50,Mobile Check in is the way to go! No lines. Digital Key worked amazing! Power supply availability in the room was very well thought out. No issues my entire stay. All in all I had a great stay at Park MGM. Plan to return soon!
50,Great stay at a great hotel! Great service! Friendly workers great location great food options in or very near to the hotel great gambling. I would defiantly recommend to anyone traveling to Vegas to stay here!
40,My stay at the Park Mgm was far better than any hotel I stayed at and I will 100% recommend it to other customers or my friends that end up going to Vegas. It’s right in the middle of everything and it’s very covenant.
30,Won't be back. Room's are average and old. Walls are so thin you can hear the next room opening their blinds. No bath tub. No fridge. Small bathroom. Terrible parking. Hallways amd elevators are hot..
30,No options for quick meals healthy snacks after morning hours and limited options in the gift shop which only provided small bottles of water at almost $5 each! Hotel room very small and hard beds.
40,Loved online check in and ability to bypass front desk and print my own room keys. Room was ready by 9 am. Three pools had plenty of chairs and umbrellas. Charging to room at pools restaurants easy. Pool staff attentive. Only concerns were no coffee in room and lobby Starbucks long lines and not open early few towels in room and had no housekeeping 2 days although called about it twice. Third stay here and only rude staff were male bartenders at center casino barr all 3 years. Good location. Will stay again
50,Hotel room was excellent. Stayed in Nightingale suite. Non smoking casino. Didn’t have to worry about smelling like smoke. Hit 2 handpays there on my 4 day stay. I’m a $1-$2 slot player. Overall casino is small but it was paying out.
50,Loved the MGM Park!  SMOKE Free environment centrally located with a free tram to Aria and Bellagio! They offered classes for new gamers and table minimums for all players.    Easy access to shows at the MGM Grand with a family friendly environment
30,6 hours it took to get my room. The shower was dirty  Rude workers at the VIP counter.  We usually have a wonderful trip at the ParkMGM this trip was not.  The Hotel seems to attracting totally different clientele
50,Excellent situation in the middle of the Strip but calm and not stressful.  Non-smoking hotel is a most in Vegas!    Excellent phonic isolation as well.    No fridge in the room but Ice-cubes available for free on each floors.
10,No fridge or microwave in the room room service only 7am-2pm Monday- Thursday… very few food options at this resort. Digital key doesn’t work. I tried to use the MLife app for the 2-1 spa the MLife desk said the park MGM spa was not accepting it at this time. This is the worst MGM I have seen.
30,Stayed here Jul 9-11 for Bruno Mars concert. It was the only reason I stayed here. A plus for a non-smoking casino clean and friendly staff.  There aren’t many restaurants or bars and it is not conveniently located on the strip if you wanted to venture out. Price was still $450+ a night. I’d stay here if I didn’t have anywhere else and don’t want to stay at Excalibur or Luxor.
30,We stayed here one night.    I’ve stayed at the location many times before when it was the Monte Carlo.    The pool area was over crowded. They have three different pools (all small) and all where jammed with people standing elbow to elbow.    The room was clean.    The hallway lighting was not good at all.
20,$158 room elevators don’t work with the App. Needed to make my own room key. Big hassle. Air conditioning horrible. Didn’t get me room requested. Walls paper thin. Long line at check-in. No refrigerator in room. Bathrooms are awesome…my only compliment.
30,Only reason I would recommend this property is the fact that it’s smoke free. Had to change rooms due to the first one not being very clean and stained carpets. The hallways were filthy and looked like they hadn’t been vacuumed in several days. I have stayed at the Park many times since it’s renovation from the Monte Carlo and have really enjoyed it until this trip. The whole vibe of the hotel was blah including the staff.
10,Manager at check in was condescending. Property was recently renovated but felt very low rent and as though they tried to put perfume on a pig. Monte Carlo should have been & still should be torn down and build a new resort. This property will fall short of quality expectations you would expect from MGM Grand or Manadalay Bay/Delano. It’s in the category of low rent Excalibur or Luxor. Very disappointed with the “want to” attitude of the front desk staff. Example : I asked the front desk rep of they had a wine opener. He said “I don’t think so but you might try the bar first” . The RIGHT answer would have been to definitively find out or go to the bar himself (or send someone or call to have one sent up to my room). There was no “want to” attitude in anyone I came in contact with during my stay. Their customer service is a disgrace and needs new schooling. Millennial hell.
50,Definitely staying here again. Love that it’s right in the middles of everything (strip). Also one thing that took me a while to notice is that it’s prolly first casino that is smoke free. Really makes a difference in your experience.
50,Excellent property in the perfect location for any events at the T Mobile arena.... Great smoke free hotel and casino which for me was a really big deal... You don’t really pay attention to that until you step inside a different hotel ....
40,Pretty good hotel if you're looking for non-smoking. Not the greatest restaurant selections. Eataly is nice but very pricey. Not too far from MGM and New York New York so you can find better restaurants close by.
40,Location and staff were great. Overall Cleanliness could have been better in the room. The location is great. Walking distance to Allegiant stadium and across from T-mobile. Considering staff shortages and overall experience would stay again.
50,Love the entire property. Restaurants are great Eataly is amazing and the location is the best part. It is in close proximity to other properties if you choose to venture around. The pools are nice too!
50,Overall great resort to stay at. From check in to check out every encounter with the staff was professional and courteous. Not sure if the root cause is the lack of staffing there is room for improvement at the pool area.
40,I'm really laid-back about hotel rooms. It was a really nice room (and the one issue it was resolved very well). It was a room and it was clean....what else do you really need in Vegas? The view from my room (316 so I'm assuming most of the even numbers) has a view of T-Mobile Arena.
40,This property is completely smoke free including the casino and bars.  I don’t have a problem with smokers but it’s kind of nice to enjoy time in the casino and bars and not smell like smoke.  The guest room was nice and clean and comfortable.  I would definitely recommend this property to stay at. Park MGM is located walking distance from T- Mobile Arena New York-New York.
10,Not what I expected and what it showed online. Room was not properly clean as well no internet working. Shower was so hard to turn on I struggle on it . Not much space to hang wardrobe furniture was very old
40,ParkMGM offers a smoke free environment which your lungs will thank you for! The staff are friendly and efficient. The accommodations provide for a very comfortable stay away from home. Restaurants at the hotel fill up quickly so make a reservation to ensure you can dine without having to wait.
50,Everything was world class. The staff is outstandingvery courteous and sensitive to my needs and requests. I can complain about anything. The food I ate there was excellent. The room was very comfortable. And the gaming was outstanding.
40,Easy self parking and it’s free when you have a players club.  Check in was a snap with the app.  Staff was friendly and knowledgeable.  The location was in the mix of the LV strip.  Room was basic.  Casino was awesome
10,Many problems with room keys and virtual check in. Virtual key did not work in elevator or the room. Had to drag luggage all over hotel to get a working room key. Lights were out in hotel room. Check-in line was astronomical at all times.
30,"I've had better experiences at other hotels. The Park MGM for being a posh hotel the check in process seemed to disorganized. We were told by a manager that ""It was Sunday and we have about 1600 check outs and it gets busy."" Well if that is a regular occurrence shouldn't that be prepared. Other than that the stay was eh okay. I enjoyed my time with the family and the pool area and staff were very helpful and professional. With that being said the Park MGM will not be first choice when I go back to Vegas."
50,I enjoyed the laid back and luxurious experience I had at park MGM. Best friends is a must if you want your taste buds to enjoy a journey. Begets was top notch steak. Eataly was delicious for gelato and breakfast. Didn’t get a chance to try the pizza and pasta but definitely will next trip. The pool wa relaxing and all the service all around was amazing
50,Beautiful hotel! Renovations look great --carpet looks dated but everything else is perfect and I love that its non smoking! Wish there was more inexpensive restaurant choices that were not Italian in the food court area-we had to go to NYNY and Aria for quick breakfast meals. The Nomad bar was closed and bummed bout that but enjoyed juniper and LOVED the Best Friends restaurants.
40,Great location fun casino great service decent room not the fanciest but clean and comfortable two thumbs up across from t mobile arena easy fast access to MGM grand New York New York aria and cosmopolitan and tram that takes you to bellagio
30,Wonderful staying at a non-smoking casino. We wish more were like this. Seemed a bit cheap of a remodel of the old Monte Carlo Resort. Not much concern over improving soundproofing. If you want a calm sleeping environment this is not the hotel for you. Long lines in lobby with almost no staff at windows.
40,This being the first smoke free resort really took my biggest issue with Vegas and made it a non-issue. Even though there wasn’t a ton for my toddler to do besides swim in the very simple pool simply being able to breathe was perfect!
40,It was clean. The digital room keys were a pain they did not always work because of internet connection. The hallways to your rooms and near the elevator there was not any a/c it was 115 outside. The hallways were dark because of paint choice. I don’t like having to pay a resort fee when you have comp. rooms.
50,Park MGM was a perfect place for 2 ladies to spend a 3 day weekend for a “girls’ weekend”!  We are already planning our next trip…thinking about coming back to another M-life property!  Keep up the good work!
50,Had a nice stay at the Park-very convenient walk to NyNy MGM  Aria and Bellagio. Staff very friendly-able to check in by phone in less than 5 minutes with help from staff member. Both bell hop were very friendly. Outstanding food selections in easy walking distances. We really liked Gonzales/Gonzales and America.
30,The receptionist who checked me in isn’t friendly at all. The room looks cheapy but I guess it serve its purpose. The walls are thin I can hear the person next door rolling down his/her blinds and numerous times felt like security guards trying to open our door. The sink in the bathroom has a very dysfunctional design: water doesn’t flow down the drain very well because it’s flat. The only thing I love about the room the shower: roomy and the water pressure is great. As for the location…it’s pretty far from the action. With the heat warning weather in July it’s miserable walking outside.
30,The rooms were hot at times and the elevators were too. Not enough hand sanitizer. Trash all around casino and lobby. Bottles sitting everywhere. Carpets were dirty. Smelled like bathroom refreshener all over. Likely cover up for old smoke..although it is now a nonsmoking hotel which is good.
50,Had a wonderful experience staying here at the Park MGM our first time here and my daughters and I loved it would definitely come back here. Location of this hotel is really good starting the strip with a lot around the area 👍
30,While we love the pet friendly aspect and smoke free atmosphere we had SO many problems that weren't resolved well at all. Our first room has a broken sink with faucet completely dislodged from the sink itself the shower did not get hot the AC didn't work and the phone was broken. Instead of offering to move us they said they would send someone up... To do construction in our room while we waited around? Not the right answer. I asked to be moved and our next room was much better but honestly neither were exceptionally clean. Second was improved though the shower now only got scalding hot. The best they could do to improve our situation was removing the resort fees... In my opinion not enough they could have at the very least removed parking as well. The stay wasn't the worst but we were not really impressed.
40,Great place to stop and much better than New York New York. Room was spacious with good view of T-Mobile Arena on 16th floor. Nice bathroom. Good for a one night stay. Recommended. Food was average in Italian Area. Front desk very friendly and helpful.
50,This hotel is clean hotel doesn’t smell  rooms are modern and clean  rooms are easy to get to  not too much over crowding and over I had a wonderful stay here . Access to the elevators is easy right by the check in don’t have to walk all across the casino to access them . You have to use your key to use the elevator love that! Gives some type of security staying there .
30,Overall it was a average Casino and Hotel I would say the rooms were less than expected and we had problems with the tub it would fill up. Don't really like stand-in tubs feels like I'm just back at home I love stand in showers personally. And there are of course on their job so you won't have issues there which is always a plus. Also if you plan on making reservations even here at Park MGM make them way in advance.
50,They were very accommodating to my breastmilk pumping needs! They gave us a refrigerator to use & a place to sit & pump with my luggage while I waited for check in. I was very pleased with their patience a d understanding to my needs!
20,There was nothing to do most restaurants closed no GF food options anywhere in the hotel. No reservations to eat available while we were there. No music no clubs you have to pay to sit by the pool!
40,This was our first time at this location and we had a great time. We will be back!  The steak restaurant was amazing food and drinks were delicious.    I found the prices of the table games to be good...............
50,We stayed at Park MGM for our 10 yr anniversary and we had such a good time. I felt safe at all times and the staff was so helpful and friendly. We loved the smoke free environment as well! Thank you!
50,The Park MGM was great for all the UFC 264 activities; I was right across the street from T-Mobile Arena and it truly felt like fight week there with all the promotions running. Being so close to the arena was a must because it was 120 degrees every day during my stay (no joke) and I did not have to take an expensive Uber or walk a far distance to get to the arena from the casino and hotel. The sportsbook bar had some good food pricey but it’s Vegas so what do you expect. Great hotel and casino if you aren’t a smoker as well I absolutely LOVED not having to walk through a fog of smoke or smell that while gambling. Such a vast difference walking into another smoking resort and Park MGM. Staff was friendly but I would recommend you check in virtually or be a priority member because it moved extremely slow. Went to Poirier’s official after party at “On The Record” in Park MGM and had a good time I’m not much of a club person but it was a small enough club it felt exclusive if that’s your scene.
20,It’s okay it’s close to T-Mobile arena but it’s just a room to get in and get out from. If it were an extended stay past 3 days it would not be comfortable. No clock no fridge to store drinks or food very small closet not much room for clothes.
50,Great place to stay! If attending an event at T-mobile arena or at the Park Theater this is easy and convenient location so you don't have to fight through traffic if staying elsewhere. Clean easy to navigate through and easy check in and out.
50,Stayed at Park MGM June 2021 for my third time. Love the big shower in the room. Casino is small and easy to get around. Met one of the Housekeeping Managers and he graciously game me a $50 voucher to eat at any restaurant at Park MGM or Nomand. Will be returning October 2021.
40,SO many good things; just was way too hot in our room and the digital keys would not work. We loved the Crack Shack and Primrose for dining. Encountered many friendly employees. Pool area was nice. Would visit again!
30,Location to arena is really the only reason to stay here. Impossible to get reservations in restaurants. Bar service was average at best. Valet attendant was honestly the friendliest and best service we had.
40,This was my first time staying at this property. It was very nice and convenient to all other MGM properties. The staff was very professional and helpful. The best thing was that the casino is completely non-smoking!
40,Although the rooms come with no microwave or refrigerator and despite having to turn the thermostat down when you first walk in the room in the middle of july the beds and pillows are comfy. Also heads up the parking doesn’t get validated .
40,Love this property - its not too expensive and has great restaurants. I also love that it is not too huge. Only negative is the pools - the vibe is like kids vacation at a Hampton Inn. The NOMAD pool is better but you must book the NOMAD to stay here.
50,Great place to stay Beautiful atmosphere! Rooms are beautiful and spacious! Close to everything! Staff is wonderful! Pool is Awesome!! This is a Wonderful place to stay especially if you enjoy not being overwhelmed by cigarettes smoke now that they are a non-smoking facility!!!
10,Room next fresh paint. Fix the broken window. Tell the maids not to come in with a do not disturb sign. Tell the front desk get their shi*t together. And keep the line moving at front desk. Make checking in more pleasant.
30,Dated rooms small windows paper thin walls noisy dark hallways no minibar décor - red wall and couch. Easy registration good spa and the Eataly eating area was excellent - good win pizza and pasta
30,No refrigerator in room bed was very stiff. TV wasn't very user friendly. No lock on bathroom door. We were shorted towels a couple days. Had to track down a cleaning staff for more towels. Ceilings were very low
30,I have nothing else to say besides if I played at the hotel I should have got comp for at least one night. No one was available to help us get our bags to the front desk. The people at the restaurant was very rude.
10,I was very disappointed and expected more from my first Vegas trip. I know people don't spend much time in their rooms but when there is a heat wave going on you need a place to rest. Preferably with a fridge for cold water.
40,Don’t pay for early check In because you still have to wait until 3pm! Room was small … get a real key card because service was sketch so had to wait to get into room or in the elevator.. convince of location was best part
50,This new rejuvenating hotel has got us staying there every time we make a trip to Vegas from now on. What we liked right away is the aroma once entering the main lobby to check in. And we noticed that it was a smoke free hotel which was a plus for my family and 2 little kids. The food choices and bars were excellent with plenty of areas to sit. Definitely will return soon.
30,Arrived 1am. Mixup on check in. Walter fixed it. Had to change rooms due to snoring next door. 2am. Love non smoking property. Nice pool areas. Primrose restaurant very good. Eataly is ok. Property needs more food variety restaurants. Hotel is rather blah. No dresser for clothing in room. AND the $125 late check out fee for 3pm was just plain gouging. Will I return? Doubtful.
10,The room was great but the workers are PREJUDICE and the treated me as if I wasn’t a PAYING customer and down played my whole existence the looked down on me and didn’t help me ! Handled me rude care I’m shocked
20,just okay.. the pool was dirty wirh grass and other stuff floatinf in it... the room wasnt gross but it could have been better. no fan in the room and the ac never felt like it was working well. i had the room set at 62 and it felt like 75 i was only in the room morning and night before/after high heat of the day. good luck getting service for drinks at the casino i gambled 2 days had for a total of 5 hrs never once had anyone approach me to ask. when i asked for a drink they acted like i was lying about gambling.
40,Good value and location. Not a fan of the room ambiance but very comfy bed and good water pressure. Good food on property primrose was great. Happy with the pool. Staff all friendly. Would stay again.
30,I paid extra for a strip view and ended up receiving a room with a view of a parking structure. Worst part is the window was covered in bird poop so I couldn’t even see outside. Also there was a cricket in the room that kept me up all night!! That should speak to the cleanliness of the hotel. Overall I would only stay at this hotel again because its smoke-free and you can actually breathe in there. Other than that I would choose a different place.
50,Cleanest of all the casinos. Middle of all the action. Quiet enough to get a good nights rest. Visited with my younger daughter and felt safe while in the hotel. Staff was friendly and helpful. This will be the only place we stay in the future!
40,I love that this hotel is dog friendly and the staff at the front desk are pretty nice and patient. The tram gets you to Aria Bellagio and Crystals and the bridge gets you to the Cosmopolitan. It is right across the street from the Coca Cola Factory and M&M Store. The only thing is the shower heads are pretty cruddy from the hard water and the decor is not that pretty. The rooms are very basic with no refrigerator or microwave.
50,Park MGM is the best hotel on the strip. Try yourselves! Wont disappoint!!!! From the crisp clean air to the amazing king staff. Only NON smoking casino on the strip! Beautiful pool as well! The beds are a game changer. Thank you Park MGM and Mlife Rewards!
30,Windows are thin it’s scary sliding closet door is also bathroom door you have to warn others before sliding back AC was terrible could not get my whole room cool unless you sit next to it and with 128° temperatures that wasn’t happening. Staff was very pleasant except for mlife rewards employee Poima made me feel like I was bothering her by asking what was on my card.
50,"We chose the Park MGM because it is smoke free and generally it was- we did notice one or two people lighting up - security apparently has to ask about a dozen people a day to stop smoking despite signage everywhere. Someone smoked in our ice machine room on our floor which was disgusting -they should put smoke detectors in there. Room layout and decor was functional and comfortable. Loved the restaurants and Italian food court area. Amazing gluten free (""friendly"") pastries and gelato too. Plenty of variety for gaming nice pool area. We would prefer if they had 1br suites but we will return anyway - maybe get connecting rooms instead when we return with our daughter. App check in will save a lot of time but watch out if you need to stand in line in the lobby to ask a question -it's painfully slow and a long wait no matter when you go there."
40,I really enjoyed our stay here - the price was pretty inexpensive and I had some perks from having the mlife cc and a platinum amex and I love a good deal! I loved that the hotel is smoke free and everything was great. I would add mini-fridges and coffeemakers to the room that would make them perfect!
50,Was shocked to see the transformation from Monte Carlo to The Park MGM. It was invting clean and refreshing to see NO SMOKING ALLOWED.  The EATLALY dining area was unique but not every eatery was open yet. The Chandelier Bar was moved to the back end of the Casino but still was a HOT SPOT for the guests.  To me it seemed that they kept the old carpet from Monte Carlo but that is all I can find as a negative if they so did.  Will be back here AGAIN!!!
50,Very nice hotel. Located so you have easy walking access to nearby casinos and restaurants. The casino itself is clean and is pleasing to the eye. Love the eatery. Really good good. The room was a good size. Will definitely stay again.
50,This was an excellent trip to the MGM Park. The room was nice and quaint. Mama Rabbit was a great bar with an excellent atmosphere. It is almost normal again. The Buffets are coming back MGM grand is up and the Bellagio buffet is almost back (16th).
40,I had to recently travel for a funeral during a holiday weekend and this was the hotel that offered the most bang for my buck during this peak season. Hotel is completely smoke free and I absolutely loved this. The beds are super comfortable. The location is at the northern end of the strip closer to the airport. Lala Noodle is amazing. Staff was super friendly and always helpful. I would have liked the AC to get a bit colder in my room but I figured it was because it was an older hotel. I called to have the AC looked at and they immediately sent someone and he changed out the filter and everything. I would recommend this hotel for budget cleanliness and location.
40,Rooms were small and way overpriced. The room couldn’t get cool and we turned all the way down the entire time. For the price it was just nothing special. If we ever went back to Vegas we would stay somewhere else.
10,Will never stay here again. Horrible food. Had to go outside of the hotel to find decent food. No in room clocks (radios) No in room coffee machine-made drinks while playing slots. I was very very very disappointed. The room next to mine set their dirty towels and trash outside the door. It sit there 3 days before it was picked up. SAD  SAD SAD
40,Room was nice and very clean the uncomfortable stage began when the air unit wold not cool down the room sufficiently this made the room very uncomfortable when the temperature outside was 105 in the evening.
50,The hotel is excellent . One of my favorite. Love that it’s Smoke free which makes it seem cleaner. Smells better than the other hotels. It’s very well located. Able to take tram to Bellagio and that part of the strip or can head the opposite way to Mandalay Bay and hit that part of the strip. The staff is fantastic . Would definitely recommend this hotel over most on the strip.
40,Love that this hotel has the tram to Bellagio and is connected to the Aria. I did Another great thing about the hotel is it is the only casino on the strip that is non-smoking! Rooms are clean but could use a little more lighting.
30,Ridiculous not to have refrigerators in the room especially when it’s 115 outside and they have the water fountains turned off and no water cups in the gym  Offer complimentary waters !!!!!!  Also rooms have virtually no draws for storage
50,Great place great food. Recommend it! You’ll love the staff casino restaurants and rooms. Be ready to come spend some money at the restaurants though. All Italian restaurants though but really great.
50,Hotel was very clean and smoke free! Easy contactless check-in & checkout. Pools were very nice food & beverage service were excellent. Room was spacious and clean! Hotel close to everything & the tram was an awesome amenity especially when it was too hot to walk outside!!!!
10,This resort is only after stealing your money. The staff is not friendly or helpful. They must be overwhelmed with Vegas opening up fully and they have lost all sense of good customer service. Save yourself and pick another resort.
40,Although the Park MGM is new it still felt dated. Hallways are low and dark. Rooms have strange artwork and an olive green with red color scheme that is simply unattractive. Bed was comfortable and an in room air purifier is great however a little noisy.
40,Renovated rooms are nice. Love the location as it is an easy walk to the Aria where I love to play poker. The Eatery is a nice venue to sample different types of food and wine. There is a convenient tram that takes you to the Bellagio.
50,Best experience I had since I’ve been vacationing in Las Vegas. It is a perfect location on the strip for accessing many of the attractions in Las Vegas and the food quality in the hotel restaurants is amazing. I am still talking about the food and several of the locations. There’s also very close to shows and Stores just in case you have forgotten an item or two. I would choose this hotel over and over and over again
40,The location is great. Hotel was clean and staff very helpful. Only downside for me was for the price it’d think the room would have a fridge and microwave. Ice from the ice machine had a terrible aftertaste and the vending machine on our floor did not work
40,The hotel smelled amazing. The rooms were nice. The second room we checked in to didn’t have all of the bathroom linens stocked so that was frustrating. I was also charged an additional $218 after checking out which I am unsure what the charges were for.
50,Perfect place to stay! We stayed in a room upstairs and walk down to see the show. Nice quiet room with a great view. Hotel had everything we needed. We went outside in the hot weather but we didn’t need to!
30,The casino and restaurants were nice. Pool experience was good but not on the level of the new hotels. The rooms were a big disappointment for a recent remodel and update from the old Monte Carlo Hotel. Staff was friendly and casino experience was great.
50,Excellent location Amazing restaurants Awesome vibe. Accommodating staff 2nd time visiting and I will definitely be visiting again. Clean spacious rooms with fun upbeat decor New favorite on the strip.
20,Overall not as clean as it should have been. Twice the room wasn’t cleaned when scheduled. Ac unit was weak. And drain in tub was horrible it barely drained while showering. Overall did not feel like a safe and clean stay
40,Housekeeping will open your door then yell housekeeping once door is fully open. Check out was 11am and their unwelcome entry came at 9:50a... hubby was in the shower door open & I was still in bed. I felt violated of our privacy. Digital locks should show we didn't open the doors after midnight therefore we are still in the room!! Use your security kick when staying here so this doesn't happen to you!
50,Easy in and out parking. Great machines and plenty of good eats !!! Rooms were not overkill just the amount of space to rest your head after a long hard day at the sports book and or pool !!! Check in was like my last date quick and easy !!!
50,The room we had at the Park MGM was very premium compared to a regular room. It was more spacious and very clean and newer looking. There was a large table a chair and a couch included. The table was nice because we brought some snacks and we purchased takeout to bring back to the room many times during our stay. Overall it was EXCELLENT!
20,Hotel is non smoking which is the best part but everyone else was poor and low quality for a $400+ per night after resort fees parking and taxes.Staff is slow and not friendly or helpful. Manager was not helpful either and wasted 2 hours not reactivating our hotel keys his name is Ace. He over charged us $50 for late checkout at 3pm when it's normally only $20. On top of that he didn't activate our hotel keys after they charged us $50 late checkout fee so we lost 2 hours being locked out of our room. The pool area is small and over crowded and not kid friendly. Other guests use foul language and even smoke inside the property when it's not allowed. I don't recommend this hotel for families with kids.
30,We were in town for an expo and was disappointed in our overall stay at the Park. We expected more from the hotel brand The check-in rep was professional rather than polite. We went to our room and it had a slight odor but I am rather sensitive to smells so I dealt with it. The side table was filthy. Although we stayed four nights housekeeping came in once to refresh the towels straighten the bed but did not change the sheets. The A/C did not work properly the temp was set to 66 degress and it was still nearly 74 degrees in the room or higher.
50,Stayed at Park MGM for the first time it was for my daughters volleyball tournament for 9 days. The rooms were clean and staff was friendly. Lines were long for food but other than that we enjoyed our stay.
50,While not the most luxurious hotel we've ever stayed at (it was very very nice) the customer service is the best we have ever had! From the moment we walked in Dylan with the bellhop station not only helped us store our luggage until our room was ready but he was quick with the behind the scene scoop that my husband asked for. Patricia with the concierge services went above and beyond in helping us pick and book restaurants for our entire stay. When she couldn't reach a couple of the restaurants then she followed up with them later and got us the tables we wanted. One of the pool bartenders made helpful diet recommendations for drinks when I asked about calorie content. Housekeeping also was great! When we forgot to take the Do Not Disturb sign off of our room during the day they willingly agreed to clean the room at 7 pm when we left the room again for dinner. Everyone working in the casino was also helpful. We were new to Blackjack but Jean the dealer helped us constantly with our moves and laughed and joked with us the entire time. She also agreed to make us lumpia (Philippine eggrolls) next time we come so we have to figure out how to contact her and hold her to that :-) Lastly a pretty slightly-older blonde server at Primrose was super friendly and even came over to our table the next day when we weren't in her section to say hi and make sure our trip was going well. Best customer service we have ever had and would highly recommend staying here!
40,Room needs cafe makerrefrigerator and microwaveneed more sigh for parking purposeneed more light on the hall way. Love that is smoking free.checking was very easyelevator was not too pack or long wait.
30,The hallway floors look dirty...but maybe because of color or they just need to be updated. The rooms were pretty clean. Wasn't a fan of the sliding bathroom doors. Other then that the service was great and the location is nice it just doesn't have a walkway to other hotels or restaurants 🤔. Sucks when it's raining!
20,Rooms- clean. / Beverage service - casino floor needs improvement; stayed 3 days and each time went to play no one would offer anything to drink. / Automated check-in process; poor - completed requirements a day prior as emailed and had to do so again day of arrival but ended up having to stand in line to get room as their system failed.
50,First of all it’s a smoke free hotel so they automatically is 10/10 for me the hotel smells so good the girl at the front desk said they switch scents every season I most def enjoyed this July scent. Location is great it’s right across hard rock and retail stores along with other attraction hotels. Value is worth every penny. small downside no mini refrigerator but that’s about it. Not a deal breaker for me. Beds are to die for some comfy the pillows I could only dream of stealing them because they were so plush. A very underrated experience and hotel will always come back to this one.
20,The hotel is dated although advertised as a new hotel the decor is far from exciting rooms are small stuffy and ac not working well carpets are old and filthy hallways dark ; casino personnel not friendly . The location was good food choices were decent
20,The new Hotel was not organized not enough staff and the Air conditioning was blowing white fuzzy stuff all over the place. The Mlife desk and the main bar ( bartender John) were exceptional. I would not reccomend this hotel restaurants were over busy confusing and not always OP pen. The steakhouse was the only restaurant that was good!
40,It was clean and wonderful water pressure. The renovations make it look like new. The beds are comfy and allow for you to rest up for your next day of pleasure. You have easy access to the tram and the strip.
20,I hate the color of the hotel. The hallways are too dark I feel like I’m in a cemetery. Color combination sucks it’s so dark green even the rooms are the same way you turn on the lights all the lights then it looks like OK it’s bright. Other than that Primrose is a nice restaurant and some other restaurants on the floor towards the strip view. Overall could be a nice hotel. Last time I stayed and this time I stayed same feeling. The rooms are very gloomy
50,First time visit and I loved EVERYTHING about this place. It's a must see! Room are large casino smoke free and very VERY nice staff. I did electronic check in and check out. which worked great. We REALLY loved the adult only pool area (they have THREE pools including one for families).
50,Glad Vegas is back. Food was good in Eataly. We really enjoyed the Non-Smoking Casino. Great atmosphere and clean. Would recommend this place to anyone for location atmosphere and friendly staff. We are going to return soon.
30,Hallway near room had broken glass and debris. Notified housekeeping and security following day the hallway was not cleaned. I've stayed at several MGM locations. This location is good but rooms are not the the best.
50,All staff helpful friendly and accommodating. Saw 4th of July fireworks from the comfort of my room. Comped stay in suite housekeeping was great all amenities I needed. Also saw Bruno Mars at the Park. As expected a great show.
40,First time stay at Park Mgm. I have stayed at other Mgm properties in the past usually the Mirage. The rooms at Park Mgm are very nice and open. Beds are SUPER comfy. Bathroom wall was kind of dirty and the safe in my room did not work. The safe situation was remedied in a timely manner by security. Casino is fully non smoking so that’s kind of cool. Shirt walk indoors to Aria is cool also. Probably would stay here again.
50,Was able to play some extensive video poker (2 machines simultaneously) hit for 4000 then 18 hours later for half of that across the street at sister property. Eataly was good  cornish game hen. Next time I'll try concert swimming or NFL game. Thanks
40,My bed was too soft..and no coffee in the room nor a robe for it to be MGM.    Location was near affordable food and an outside spot to relax in the park across the street..Also across from New York New York.
30,Checking in early via the app and trying to use the digital key to get into your room so you can avoid the line checking in didn't go well. I kept getting error messages that their system was having issues. And they didn't clean our room on one of the days.
50,Beautiful hotel great central location good selection and quality is amazing. This hotel is always the highest quality and a pleasure to stay at. Three location is central to south end of strip however there is really nothing missing within 5 min walk.
30,Hilarious both reviews are noise related. This time it was a sex crazed couple whom were very loud with their grunting and moaning...hahaha I don't think I'm going to stay at Park MGM anymore....never had noise issues at other properties...but Park MGM? Two times both noise related...lol and I've been to Vegas over 50 times or so
40,Recommended for location value and friendliness. Provided early check-in without needing to stand in line. Room had a long couch and great view of the T-Mobile Arena and surrounding area. Close walking distance to high-end stores nice malls and shops high-end and normal eateries Target CVS Walgreen's etc.
40,We all loved the non-smoking casino but the machines were tight. The cabana we rented was great! Three pools provides plenty of space for lounging. Drink prices seemed high. The rooms were spacious but the beds were very uncomfortable.
50,Very Clean Refreshed Smoke Free Hospitality was Great. I felt safe very good Security. Loved how the Elevators were only used with your Room Key. Very good centrally located. The Park and Park Theater within a good distance.
30,The check in process is way too slow made the line is very long and it's really time consuming. The front desk doen't have enough people to handle all the check in makes the line is very long. Hope they can make some changes about the check in.
20,I booked two rooms at the same time and we were given rooms in different towers separate floors and different elevators to access. The beds were rock hard and the air conditioning did not cool the room at all.
50,The hotel itself is very nice clean and modern. The rooms are nicely decorated and the bathroom is really cool. The beds are comfortable and there were 4 very nice pillows on each bed.    The best part of this hotel is how nice it smells. When you walk through the casino - you can actually breathe!
20,FELT LIKE MOTEL 6  No coffee maker  Your could hear every sound pipe lines every door closing. Couldn’t sleep at all. Hall ways were nasty dark and carpets nasty. Not enough informational signs to get to your room. Beds were great so comfy and clean
50,Truly a smoke free environment the staff members were so friendly and helpful our entire stay! Was really nice to not have to walk through the entire casino to check in or to get to the parking garage. Perfect layout. Thank you!
50,The Park MGM is totally a smoke free environment. The staff from the parking attendant to restraunt staff to the front desk were all friendly and very helpful. The room was spacious with very comfortable beds and clean bathrooms with wonderful walkin showers. Great water pressure.
30,Because the air-conditioned wasn't working they came did something to it and it worked for one night then the TV kept going off and the house keeper didn't changed the sheets when we wasn't in the room and I had to call for everything like tissue more towels etc
50,Room was Spacious Quite and Very CLEAN! Location is great for Restaura nts and Gaming (casino was very crowded and noisy on Saturday much more pleasant on weekdays). The staff (all Departments) were exceptionally helpful and friendly. I highly recommend this MGM property.
40,Was a nice room very clean only complaint would be no refrigerator which would be helpful to hold drinks. Smoke free was amazing especially traveling with kids for a volleyball tournament. Will come again
50,This is the cleanest place in Vegas and it’s not close! As a non smoker it was nice to not have to walk through cigarette smell constantly during my stay or while in the casino area. The sports book also provided a great space to watch the playoffs!
50,First night of staying in Park MGM and had a difficult time using my phone app. Key card to operate the elevator to my floor at the hotel. The security guard name Daniel Dost was so helpful that he assisted me with getting to my floor due too heavy check in at front desk. Awesome employee and very professional in assistance to guests needs.
40,Hotel was nice but needed a few things to top it off. Room is not as updated as I expected for a place that was just remodeled. I just got the normal two queen strip view. There is no fridge in the room. Which if you had to store insulin or even a drink you are out of luck unless you maybe spring for a suite. But it’s Vegas how much time do you spend in the room. The room also lack some storage for clothes very minimal. But other than that the place was clean everywhere.
50,Park MGM is so far our favorite property. The non-smoking casino Eataly and location is perfect for our needs. The property is clean and less trashy then many other Vegas properties. We will 100% make this our priority property when we can. M only request would to make one of the three pools 21 and over. I like kids but not in Vegas when parents let them run around scream and splash. The poor lifeguards had their hands full.
40,This casino is appealing to people who don't want to be bothered by all of the smoking in the casino. The air conditioner is a bit too cold but overall the environment felt safe. They need to keep one of the restaurants open during late night because once it's closed there is nothing to eat.
40,We love staying here at the Park MGM the price is pretty affordable as Vegas Resorts go but you still get a top notch experience as if you're staying at one of the higher rated MGM resort properties. Also the smoke free atmosphere allows us to stay up longer and enjoy all the amenities offered by the MGM resort.
50,Nice to have a non-smoking casino where it's easy to navigate through. We;ve stayed in many of the resorts on the strip and this ranks up as one of the top. It's in a great location easy to get in and out of and although I was first skeptical about the Italian food court my meals there were very good. I would recommend this casino to everyone. The one and only problem I had was that the two servers in the food court where the gelato is served were both very curt and rude toward us. It was strange. They both had very negative attitudes and behaved as if we were burdening them by placing an order.
40,This hotel is clean location is perfect. Direct access to Aria from Aria you can go to Bellagio thru Vdara with minimal outdoor time. (Great if you are traveling during the summer!) Price is reasonable with the space you get.
40,It was very nice staying at Park MGM but it was really inconvenient staying in this season without refrigerator service in the room. It was kind far from the elevator access. The receptionist and M’s life customer service reps were really nice.
30,It was nice not smelling of smoke when we left the property. The staff was over the top nice! When we got to the rooms you could tell that this was an older hotel that had been refurbished. The room was nice sized our table was very unstable. The beds were very low and it was very hard on my knees to get in and out of the bed.
40,I would stay at Park MGM again. Check in and check out was smooth. You could choose self check in and print your own key or use phone instead. Friendly service. Quick response when we needed more towels. Clean.
50,The digital check in process was great as I didn't have to wait in a long and my room was ready by the time I landed. The staff was very friendly and made my stay fun and enjoyable. I would definitely stay here again
50,We stayed 3 nights was unsure because of smoking rules and my BF is a smoker but we really enjoyed the stay. It was nice to not walk through without smelling smoke especially when you’re in and out of other casinos on the strip. After a long day you come into crisp air and we like that a lot.
20,No coffee machine or fridge in room. We had to wait an hour in line downstairs to get our morning coffee. Also there was no fridge in our room to keep our waters and other drinks cool. We had to improvise with room garbage cans to fill them with ice.
30,"The Hotel:  I was very surprised to hear that the Park MGM had a 1/2 billion dollar renovation four years ago. It's true that it does not have a kitchy theme which I prefer but it already looks outdated and worn. The lobby is quite nice the casino is nice. The rest is just OK could be much better.    the room: outdated looks like it's from the 90s. We had 2 rooms. In one the carpet had stains in the other the carpet was freshly cleaned and still very wet when we arrived felt like someone took a hot shower right before you entered musty. The bathroom is not modern not enough counter space and had an ""IKEA-type shelf"" for added space. While the water pressure was very good the look of the shower was outdated. The room walls are dark red and the carpet is emerald green. The art work on the walls was not pleasing at all in fact it had border-line offensive photos of women's breasts and butt (not naked but this was the feature) and then a bunch of other mismatched art work. Maybe I'm not artsy enough but I did not get it and I did not enjoy it. The A/C was just from one vent and the room was never cool enough especially when we had all three guests inside. There is no refrigerator or microwave or coffee maker in the room.    mobile check-in / mobile room key cards / regular room key cards: mobile check-in worked great our room was ready when we arrived and we had a mobile room key available on our phones. The check-in lines were quite long when we arrived and we were very glad to not have to wait in this line. However the rooms keys on our phones did not work in the elevators they did work on the room sometimes. We decided to get actual room key cards but these too did not work all the time and we wend down almost daily to get new ones.    The elevators / corridors: the area near and in the elevators needed to be vacuumed. When you walked out of the elevators the ceiling was so very low and the A/C did not work in fact on our floor it felt like it was blowing hot air. I realize that there were very many people (the hotel was very fully booked when we were there) and the corridors needed to be vacuumed also.    Late check-out: we were given free late checkout until 12 1 hour longer than normal after that it was charged per hour. $30 until 3:00 it was fine and I was glad for the option.    Swimming pool / chairs: They do not offer any free seating near the pool all of it has to be booked way in advance (not even 1 lounge chair was available 3 days before our arrival) and it's expensive. We were told that we could check for cancellations on the day of but we decided to not even go to the pool because of this.    customer service: was really good. We wanted to change one room to have 2 queen beds vs. 1 king bed and we were accommodated. When we needed slippers glasses towels these were brought up quickly. The front desk staff were very nice. However super long wait times when I tried to call the hotel prior to our arrival.    Eating / Restaurants in hotel: be prepared to wait very long for everything. Primrose near the lobby had only a 15 minute wait for lunch very short compared to everything else and food was very good but pricey. Eataly was always so very busy long lines everywhere also pricey. We ordered food delivery one day and were allowed to sit in the conference room area where there are tables and seating this was a very nice option since we were a group of 9 and could eat all together and comfortably. However we had leftovers but absolutely no way to heat them up the next day (not one microwave in the entire hotel).    Tram to Bellagio: a very nice free option but stops working at 8:00pm very early.    Las Vegas in general:  While open and very crowded already Las Vegas is not ready for these big crowds. It seems that staffing is a huge issue. We went to one casual restaurant where the wait for 3 people was 45 minutes though there were plenty of empty tables we were told that they did not have enough staff and could not serve all the tables at once. I would say that 2/3 of the buffets are not yet open. The 1/3 that is has lines of over 1 hour only open for lunch or only open on certain days hours etc. Cesar's buffet is open but is fully booked through end of July. In general eating options are limited lines are very long and everything is expensive. Few shows were open when we were there. In general everything is very expensive.    In summary: The hotel was just OK probably will not stay here again. Everything is super expensive. We went end of June because we were with a large volleyball tournament (not flexible on travel dates) -- it would have been much better to go later maybe in 2 or 3 months when more things should be more open / available. I feel a bit jipped as the hotels are all practically full and charging guests but the guests have very limited options once there."
40,Room was still being cleaned after we checked in. Sheets were slightly stained. Wish we had a mini fridge but other than that…Staff was friendly hotel was clean and comfortable. Casino was clean friendly dealers. Blackjack Joe was a pleasure. Craps Amrose was friendly and had a great personality. Both dealers made my time in the casino more enjoyable.
40,Hotel was nice enough but like everything in Vegas outrageous prices for food and wine etc. I was also disappointed in Vegas overall - much seedier than what I remembered and too loud and too many people. Couldn't wait to get home to Florida. Maybe I'm just getting old.
50,Wife and I were here for 3 nights during Memorial Day Weekend.    What's not to like about this place? It has Eataly La La Noodles down stairs and a food court across the park in NYNY. It is centrally located with a tram to Aria and Bellagio. If you know all the internal casino maps you can walk to The Palazzo only stepping outside like 3 short times.    Our check in process was completely digital. I checked in on my phone through the app and received a digital key on the app we didn't talk to a single person. This is a nice touch I enjoy checking in this way.    Our room is clean and comfortable. Bathroom amenities was good. WiFi worked through out our stay.    Overall it was an outstanding mid-ranged hotel and casino that's why we keep coming back here.
30,The room has so much dust on bed frames shelves and couch. Cleaning crew did not clean properly. Toilet was used and filled with previous tenant's p**p. The sound from other rooms can be easily heard throughout the whole night.
50,Our room and the facility in general was very clean and updated. The noise level was also minimal. The staff were friendly and helpful. I also appreciated the fact that it is a non-smoking hotel. The air always smelled fresh.
50,Super Clean Non Smoking Casino and Amenities. Immaculate throughout. Eataly provides something for everyone. We will definitely stay here again. The checkin process with the MGM App was awesome too! Our phones worked perfectly for elevator access and keyless room access.
20,The only good part was the food at Eataly but service was horrible and rude with lots of attitude we will not be coming back! Hotel ran out of towels 2 hours before closing and my kids were soaked!!!!
40,Non-smoking facility which was really nice. Great staff easy check in which we did through the app. Rooms are pretty nice but not a lot of counter/table space in room. No coffee pot in rooms and no fridge but I think a lot of hotels in Vegas charge for a refrigerator if you want one brought up to your room.
40,First time stayed at Park MGM and it was great we will stay in this resort again our family like the restaurants the pool and most of all how clean it is! also great location right in the middle of strip.
50,We had an incredible stay. The room was clean and high class. Towels were replaced swiftly. We loved eating downstairs at Eataly and the convenient center of the strip location. My favorite hotel in Vegas so far
40,Good property nice location. Online checkin was fabulous - avoided the lines. SMOKE FREE!!! Convenient to other properties on the Strip. Good value for the price midweek. Wish they had coffeee in the rooms.
30,We loved the fact this is 100% smoke free - SO great! Mobile check in and out was very slick. Internet signal was often weak and air conditioning was not adequate. Mobile key entry worked great WHEN it worked. Strip view king room was comfortable w/ basics. The pool was nice but closed at 7pm. Close to lots of things and tram was about a block away. We would stay there again to not smell cigarettes. Enjoyed our stay --
40,Some great things and some things that need improved. Great check in process on the app. Property is nice overall. Room air conditioner was not able to cool room well. Great shower. Terrible view from the 6th floor. Stained floor. Housekeeping missed us on our first full day. Good location as home base. Friendly staff. Eately was awful for Vegans. The beds were nice. The TP horrible.
40,The room was small. Tv didn’t work most of the time. Line for check in was so long. Pool was crowded. The security at the pool check in was rude and line to get into pool was long. Don’t try to bring in more than 1 drink into to pool area
20,The room does not have a microwave or fridge. Room service to order food stops at 2pm during the week. Front desk was rude! Air conditioning didn’t work well! The thermostat was as low as it could go (60 degrees) and it was still hot in the room. It was cooler in the hallways. The WiFi connect sucked. Download the app so you can avoid check in and check out lines!
30,Front desk employees don’t care whose there first. We waited in the exclusive line over 20 min with just 4 of us waiting in line. Because employees would help any random person walking up to them. I had to go and say something.
20,Had a bad experience checking in. Rooms (3) took forever. Arrived at 9am and checked in and didn't end up getting my rooms till almost 7pm. That's really unacceptable staff wasn't much help and honestly kind of rude. I took me multiple trips and discussions with front desk to get rooms. Had great experiences before at mgm resort and this fell well short of my expectations from this company. If it wasn't for us being comped by Willie (manager) for some food and drinks I would give worse review. I expect more from this company. Hopefully next trip to Vegas comes with better experience.
50,Will be back! The rooms were great and bed was comfortable. On-site restaurants were perfect. We didn’t have to travel much out of the hotel for anything. It’s also per friendly which I will be returning with my fur baby.
40,Good price for the room and perfect for a quick two day trip. No true complaints other than i prefer a room with a view and and a tub. This room only had a shower but it was the best damn shower ever. The water pressure was on point. I prefer being a little more center strip but if you like MGM brands it is centrally located.
40,Park MGM was a nice stay. The highlight for me at Park MGM is the access it provides to what is around. From Eateely which I Love to bars and casino life. The access to the surrounding venues is very cool.
50,"I stayed at this hotel for three days. As I told my partner there's not a thing I can complain about or say ""I loved it but..."". There's no but it's a great place to stay. Our room was ready at 10am when we arrived even though check in officially starts at 3pm. I got the app and had a digital key ready to go when I got off the plane. The room was clean and quiet. We spent a few hours at the pool each day and had no trouble getting chairs. The cocktails at the pool are excellent and it wasn't at all crowded. The hotel and casino are non-smoking so it was a nice place to spend a few hours losing money. Best of all the Park MGM is pretty centrally located so you can easily walk to most of the places you want to see. Even the Bellagio is an easy 30 minute stroll away. 5-stars I'd absolutely stay here again."
40,Worth stating in this type of room. You will be located on a high floor 23rd and up a separate elevator access. The air purifier works well during this times and room ambiance feels cleaner. Shower feels great.
50,Everything about Park MGM was great! Can’t complain about anything. Food casino and pool was perfect! I will definitely be back and book my room again with park mgm! By far favorite hotel on the strip
50,Staying here is always the best! The valet was great and bell service was quick and easy. It’s super clean every time we stay with great staff who are extremely happy and kind and helpful!! 😊  Thanks park mgm!
30,Be prepared to pay for parking and valet. Even as a hotel guest. I’ve stayed around the strip and never had to pay for parking or valet. I make sure to tip the workers as well as the concierge employees but parking rate per night is ridiculous
20,Rooms had a very old feel and look. It wasn't anywhere worth the money they are charging for rooms these days.The Eataly area was neat but more overpriced than it should be. The casino price minimums were insanely high for this small type of hotel. We won't stay here ever again.
40,Being an all non-smoking hotel and casino the place felt very clean. Our room was pretty basic but clean and soft beds. Our a/c was not very cold at night but it was 110 degrees during the day so not sure if it just couldn't keep up. The bathroom floor was extremely slippery. I think it was just the type of tile so be careful walking in. The mobile check in was nice but you have to sign into the wifi each time you come back to the hotel which was a paid just to get our room card in the app (which is also required to select your room in the elevator). We ended up just getting a physical card but defeats the purpose of having the ease of the app. It was nice having 3 different pools. There is a QR code on the back of the chairs so you can order food & drinks right from your chair. We really enjoyed this option. Overall it was a great stay despite the minor inconveniences.
40,Ate at La La noodle restaurant great tasty food. Recommend to all. Cleanliness The casino very clean non-smoking inside it. Superb. Casino location a plus. Downs. Parking should be at NO cost to guests. Rooms MGM could’ve done better (larger rooms). More staff at check-in to provide less wait time to guests. Per wife Casino needs real plants/flowers will give the Casino a fresh look when guests come in.
20,My overall experience at the park MGM was very horrible. They treated me and my partner like we were less than them. I’m most likely not ever recommending the Park MGM to anyone I know. The Front desk Staff was very rude.
20,The location is great the beds are super clean and comfortable. However the rooms share a common door we had a large family next to us who were very loud and noise traveled easily into our room all hours of the night. The kids were screaming and often tried to open the common door which if not locked would have let them directly into our room. If you do not know the people you are staying next to I would not risk it and stay here. I personally will not stay here ever again because of this.
30,Room was OK. (Online check in a plus). Eatily and LaLa noodles were fine. Everything was ok. No raves no major complaints. Lines were long for elevators to upper floors. Prices were as expected for Vegas (high).
40,Resort has a great location on the strip. Best part is the entire resort is smoke free my wife and i loved that. The pool is relaxing it isnt big but it was clean and the staff were very helpful. Casino is setup well not very big but had all of the games and slots that you would want and once again smoke free. We will be going back to Park MGM soon hopefully to catch a live sporting event in the arena that is directly across the street.
20,I believe they just renovated the lobby only as the rooms was dirty and carpet stained the digital key does not work in the elevator due to the poor service in the building. When advising the front desk the young lady has a attitude and suggested I stay elsewhere
40,Adequate clean rooms. Quiet floors staff efficient and maintained pandemic guidelines. This hotel is central on the strip across from New York New York which has a variety of food options. Good ground transportation availability and good security presence. Hope to return later this year when more amenities open up. The one challenge was finding a variety of places to eat within the hotel. For instance we made reservations at the Noodle Restaurant once we arrived it was closed.
20,Bathroom and floor were not clean. Trash and debris all over the floor of room. Called down to housekeeping for blanket was advised they had run out of blankets. When talking to front desk was not friendly or helpful or cared to offer any help. Spa massage was cancelled for no apparent reason. Not a good stay.
50,One of the best customer service experiences I’ve had with a hotel definitely recommend anybody looking for a nice modern stay! Love that they are smoke free hotel rare find! Can’t wait to plan my next trip
50,So refreshing not to have to dodge the smoke in the casino. Everything smelled clean and fresh. All of the staff were friendly and accomodating. Had room service breakfast a few times and prices and service fees and auto tip added up to price of a nice dinner.
10,Awful experience at check in for invited guests and platinum mlife. No bottled water or mini bar in the room. All the shops and restaurants are closed at night and I had to leave the casino and walk down the street to cvs to get something to drink in the middle of the night
50,Great room. It was smoke free which is real nice. Had issue when we first got to our room. Bathroom was leaking and they had us in a new room in less than five minutes. Showers are awesome great pressure.
50,Their definition of ReWARdS must be lOokEd aT very disappointing you play all year for that one moment only to find out its scam like sitution!!! I will let anyone willing to listen about it!! Other than that PARK MGM IS A GREAT PLACE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!@!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
50,I recommend park mgm Las Vegas if you want a great experience. It’s dead center of everything on the strip. The pool area was nice and clean and the slushees were amazing. The rooms where nice and clean and the beds felt like clouds. If your looking for a great restaurant pbr grill and bar is so nice we had to go back twice lol. Overall great experience
50,I had a great stay at Park MGM for many reasons. I've liked this location when it was Monte Carlo and the new resort is even better. Lots of great food options on property and with NYNY right across the street even more options are close by. Absolutely loved the smoke-free casino even though Blackjack tables at times were a bit scarce. Overall great stay!
50,Good experience great pool and clean and nice. Just poor experience with digital key reader in all elevators when trying to get to my room. The key worked for my hotel room but not in the elevator but it was an easy process to print a key from the app and get a plastic key.
50,Great vacation and will definitely be back soon. Checking in and out via the MGM app is very convenient. Room keycard on the app is great too. Restaurants didn’t have a wait which is nice. The casino was clean and loved that it was smoke-free. Only one we visited that was so definitely a plus.
50,I highly recommended this hotel the employees are very friendly and it is super clean the beds ar super comfortable and the room absolutely clean and beautiful I will come back and I will stay in this place again for sure
50,I had a very nice stay at the Park MGM. The rooms were clean and the property is centrally located on the strip. Close to all of the restaurants T-Mobile Stadium and other attractions. The pool area is also a nice amenity for relaxing and catching some rays. I would definitely stay here again.
50,This is my fifth or sixth stay at the Park. Clean rooms helpful staff and just a really nice vibe in the casino area. It’s really nice to have a non-smoking casino even as a smoker. The pool area is great lots of umbrellas and the service was great too.
50,This was one of our beat stays in all the 11 yrs of coming to vegas for my bday. Everything was amazing from the smallest to the biggest things that PARK offers. The one thing that stood out was the bypass the front desk check in process. Park sent me an email saying bypass the front desk and listed our floor room number and the digital keys right from the app on your phone(download the app). How many times does the key card stop working&u have to go back to the front desk…that’s now a thing of the pass.
50,This hotel is totally non-smoking in all areas. No smoke smell and no having to tolerate breathing second hand smoke. Casino is fun and Eataly is a fabulous place to eat and drink. Overall great experience. Roy Choi's Best Friend restaurant served some of the best food I've ever had. Recommend the Kimchi Fried Rice Fried Chicken and the Frose. Rooms a little on the small side but comfortable.
40,Very nice hotel. Online check-in is great (not having to wait in line). Room was nice but a/c struggled to keep room cool. Hotel is still using Covid as an excuse to limit maid service and keep several restaurants closed. We went elsewhere to eat because of this (as did hundreds more hotel guests). It is great to have a totally non-smoking hotel.
50,Initially upon arrival we were put off by learning we were going to be charged for parking. The hostess at registration quickly adjusted this because we had made our reservation before this charge was reimplemented.  We were impressed by the ambiance the wide selection of games the excellent staff and restaurants.  The room was nice. Surprised there was not a coffee pot available. Very grateful that maid service has returned.  At the end of our stay we agreed that the property has been successfully reimagined and has many reasons to return.  However because we have so many options available to us we will not return as long as there is a charge for parking for guests on top of the resort fee.  MGM should reconsider this unpopular charge.
50,Location is Great Price is great with back access to Aria. Only issue I had is getting the FB credit on the last day of checkout. Then I have to wait in the checkin line for like 30 minutes in the morning to get it resolved.
20,Good location room was average trouble with redeeming resort credits parking validation and myVEGAS rewards. My Comp offers were not with the visit because the room was not the best and not able to use and all the resort credit.
40,This was our 15th or so stay at the Park. Room was nice and clean with an amazing shower. View was not great but we didn’t ask for a view. Non smoking was nice and hours was amazing! Will definitely be back again!
10,Went to check in and got into our room after a long flight from NC. Took a shower went to get in the bed and it was a spider. I immediately went downstairs and spoke with the front desk. I didn’t even want to stay at the property at this. Not to mention had another bad experience at another property prior to. Waited for 25 minutes to get a refund and they didn’t do much as ask if it was anything they could go through the inconvenience. Such a let down from such a big company.
50,Very clean rooms and casino; non-smoking casino; Personnel were helpful and friendly. Phone communications with the casino can be frustrating due to hold times. Not many amenities in the rooms but enough for me.
50,Hotel was very clean. Was incredibly happy with it being a smoke free facility. This was a family trip the front desk helped accommodate us with adjoining rooms. The pool area was super clean and very nice. We had an amazing experience and would highly recommend staying there again.
50,Will stay @ The Park MGM again! Checkin was a little long ladies could give a smile when helping you out. Casino smelled super clean No Smoking loved that.Will be back to stay again! Thank You Park MGM
40,I wished there were two options for pillows. The mattress was very comfortable. We would like more options for breakfast besides coffee and pastries. We went across the street to NYNY at America restaurant for full breakfast. The hotel and casino is non smoking . I enjoyed that. Rooms were very clean. Overall our stay was great.
40,Wish rooms were nicer... other wise i really enjoyed my stay i would book there again.  I did not like that the bathrooms had a weird smell to it and i did not like that one bit maybe add some good freshners lol...
40,The Park MGM Las Vegas is a nice newer hotel. The MLife priority made check in quick and smooth. The hotel room was clean but there were not dresser drawers to unpack clothes from our suitcase. Housekeeping took our dirty towels wash cloths and bathroom floor mat and didn't replace them. We didn't notice until later in the day. When I called housekeeping the next morning they didn't answer the phone. I had to go to the Front Desk to have them contact housekeeping.
30,Stayed here a month ago for a week as part of a American Airlines promo. I'm not a gambler so keep that in mind when reading this review. The location is fine right along the main strip and next to NYNY and Aria. The rooms were fine. The places to get coffee like the Starbucks inside or the coffee/bakery in the Eataly food court didn't open until 7am. So if you're an early riser that will be a drag. By 7am there is usually a line 40 people long to get into Starbucks and although the line at the coffee bar in Eataly was shorter they take forever to make you a coffee so it seems like an eternity to get a simple cup of coffee. The pool area is family friendly so there are kids running around. And the pools are rather small so it was usually crowded with a mix of sketchy adults that don't look like the people you see in the advertisements. And while I was there most of the onsite restaurants either didn't open at all so the Eataly food court was the only option on-site. I ended up going to the food court in Aria or in NYNY since they were open. And the Starbucks in NYNY opened earlier than the one at the Park MGM. The open air park/seating area between Park MGM and NYNY was a nice place to have a drink and a cigar which I did often during my visit. Maybe with COVID starting to wind down more things will be open now but not sure.
30,Despite the recent renovations from the old Monte Carlo which brought much better dining options a new lobby and casino the hotel rooms and hallways of the Park MGM remain tired and banged up and pretty basic (no work desk).
50,Staff in check-in housekeeping MLife area dealers security and the stores and restaurants went above and beyond to make guests feel important. They were all very helpful. Whether it was to replace a lost room key or lost MLife area give directions to various locations or instruct newcomers at the blackjack tables the staff treated us with respect. Restaurant and store staff helped resolve any questions we had.
40,it's great that they have made the whole hotel and casino non-smoking excellent service through out hotel and casino food in the eatery was fantastic a little pricey location at the center of the strip is great
50,Clean. Excellent food. Wonderfully nice staff. Loose slot machines. Wonderful view of T-Mobile arena and the VGK game on the jumbo screen. Perfect distance from other restaurants and Marshall’s and Target. I even bore witness to a protest (not related to the hotel) .    It was An overall excellent trip.
30,This hotel is fine. Nothing special about it. Very typical Las Vegas- loud lots of people. The rooms were fine- nothing unique. Bed was relatively comfortable. The bathroom smelled a little. I appreciated the smoke-free hotel.
20,I would just pay more for a better room next time! If nothing else matters and you are looking for a spot to lay your head at night that is on the strip...this is the place for you! My room was not clean or comfortable.
40,We were hitting a Knights playoff game and picked the Park MGM because of close it is. It was a little hard to park to check in because we arrived around game time but the mobile check-in option by the garage elevators was slick. Everyone was very helpful and friendly. The hotel looks great until we got off on our 6th floor where the carpets were pretty rough ceilings low and everything very dark. The room was fine. The shower had some awesome water pressure. That alone would probably take me back ha. That can be such a weak spot in so many hotels. Overall it checked the boxes and was great for what we paid.
30,Rooms are outdated I would stay again if I had too. But I don’t think I would. I’ll try another hotel next time. Everything is really close to the hotel which is a plus. The room was really hot and I had to ask the staff to come look at the AC.
50,We stayed at the Park MGM from June 16 2021 to June 22 2021. The staff was very friendly and professional. The hotel was very clean and had a pleasant smell. This is a no smoking hotel which was a delightful surprise when we arrived. The staff is constantly cleaning. They are very thorough when they clean the rooms. I would strongly recommend this property and would stay again the next time I am in Las Vegas!
40,The service was fine the food was ok. The pool is great. Bartenders Carlos & mark are the best thing since mixed cocktails. The roulette tables need to run more hours. The poker tables are hard to win on.
50,Love the pool area didn’t get a chance to get it. Love the restaurant but was very pricey. Love the red room nice view. Very good area close to everything that I want to visit. Staff very friendly. Thank u
20,Worst Vegas experience ever! Room wasn’t clean unprofessional & was charged for items I never ate or drank! Front desk was not helpful & unprofessional. The fact that I had to beg for towels and had to debate the cleanliness of the room! Don’t get me wrong it is a great property but there are tons of things overlooked.
40,This is our second stay since it’s been Park. We were there in April for my husband’s birthday and we went again in June with our daughters. Customer service via email we’re great. Quick to respond and we’re able to help with our issue. Front desk people are awesome! The line is long but you can actually check in without waiting in line. The only reason we had to was to add parking to our room. Only downside was that even as a guest and paying resort fees for nothing we even used we still had to pay $15 a day for parking as guests. The only plus to that is that you get in and out privileges at all MGM properties without having to pay again. You’d think it’d be included for all guests not just the higher tiered mlife reward members.
10,Hair on our bed- it’s not been cleaned very well as lots of grime and dust around the bed- Starbucks was only open one of the four days there -terrible experience - front desk lines were long- restaurants not open
50,The rebranding of the Monte Carlo as The Park could not be more perfect. It is a very classy casino/hotel without the expanse of other Vegas mega-casinos. The Park actually has a homey feel to it and Eataly is amazing. The best part of all it that the entire hotel is no smoking!
30,The rooms were mediocre pretty good. Some stains on pillows and towels. Getting to your rooms could be confusing since there are some illusions and shady looking pathways. Gets pretty loud during 1-3am. Long walks to get food had to walk to Sin City at night to get average food not the best idea unless you want to meet drug addicts traipsing around the area.
20,The a/c in the room took 3-4 hours to cool it down. When I left the room I set the temp at 65. When I came back to the room it felt like 90. I had to turn the thermostat down to 60 and wait 3-4 hours before it cooled off. With this being a fairly new hotel I would expect the a/c to actually work. When getting of the elevator to go to my room it felt like there was no a/c at all in the hallways. Seemed like it was about 95 degrees. The door to the bathroom was not clean. The inside (white part of the door) had dirty greasy finger prints. Looked like it hadn't been cleaned in at least a month. Not acceptable! The cleaning ladies were pleasant and friendly. The rest of the hotel staff barely noticed my existence. Most casino dealers didn’t speak more than 5 words while I was gambling. If you are looking for a fun friendly atmosphere I would not consider this hotel.
50,We loved staying at Park MGM! It's situated in a great location on the strip the property itself is a perfect size and there are a lot of restaurant options at the property - you can't miss eating an authentic slice of pizza at Eataly! We enjoyed the pool and the bed in our room was very comfortable. The rates were also extremely reasonable. One of the most enjoyable parts of our stay was the staff - everyone we came in contact with was incredibly friendly and also more than willing to assist us if we needed it. I highly recommend a stay at Park MGM and look forward to my visit here again in the future.
30,Rooms are a little Noisy. I don’t mind but could hear noises in room next door. Connecting door didn’t help. Noises like Voices and pulling up or down of window shades.  Also door to room very thin and when room right next door opened and closes it felt so loud like it was my own door opening and closing. I got sort of paranoid because I have seen the movies where people get the wrong room keys.  Beds are sort of low. Vanity mirror light is super bright. Strip view is okay but far off strip so not as nice as other hotels.  Renovated rooms are not bad. Decor is bold for sure. My rooms walls were dark red as were the shades and the shower tiles were orange red.  Check in kiosks worked okay although they offered me an upgrade which then said it was sold out of.  Property map on website was very not detailed. Actual signs are good enough and the property is not that big so you wouldn’t get lost.  No mini bar or fridge.  Housekeeping don’t replace glasses or ice bucket bags if you use them.  When I booked I wanted somewhere cheap and somewhere I hadn't been before so I didn’t mind that it was not near the south end of the strip and not in the middle (the middle in my mind being more convenient for getting anywhere).  Nice enough pool good amount of shade it was nice to have a party ish zone and a quiet zone.  Fast key replacement when I misplaced my key.  I used the same machines to check out and at first it said I was charged for the upsell (that I was offered at check-in) even though it was actually unavailable at check in. Then it said a refund was issued but overall it was Confusing. In the end I don't think i paid for it - the machine told me it wasn't going to be charged.  It was nice to be able to choose CAD instead of paying in USD on my Canadian credit card.    When i asked a staff member she said the the system does make mistakes like that.  In any case I couldn't figure out whether I did get the up sell. When i booked online I didn't ask for a strip view and it said King bed. When i got my room I did get a sort of strip view and two queens. So who knows.  Sadly there was no late check out available. At least I was able to drop off my luggage at the bell desk.
40,The Park MGM Las Vegas is well worth the stay. Check-in was not lengthy. Be aware of the resort fees and $100/night incidental fee that's due upon check-in. The incidental fee is refundable upon check-out. The bathroom was spotless!! Bed was comfy. No fridge or microwave. Parking was free which was a plus! The only downside was the The Haus of Gaga was closed. You're able to see her costumes via the window but I would have liked to get in to see the entire collection up close. If you are fully vaccinated wearing a mask is your choice.
50,Great place to stay The swimming Pool has shaded area's and you can order Drinks and food on your phone form your lounge area. Prices are not bad for this service. I also really enjoyed the smoke free environment.
50,Everyone was so friendly staff and guests included! We had an excellent experience! Plenty of food options right at your hotel and great location! Within walking distance of many restaurants and other casinos! And smoke free! Will definitely be back!
50,Stayed here for four days and loved it! The room was clean and minimally decorated. The bed and pillows were super comfy. The shower was my favorite part because it was huge and had great water pressure. There are tons of restaurants and stores within the hotel so you honestly don’t have to go far. I checked in using my MGM app and utilized a digital key but you can always get a traditional key as well. It would make getting on the elevators easier because sometimes pulling up the digital key was a hassle. I would definitely recommend this hotel!
50,Great hotel super happy. Pool was amazing get very safe after coming back from COVID will be staying here again when we come back! Great job MGM park!! Staff made you feel very welcome and open to any questions you had
50,Everyone is nice and friendly. Also helpful with directions. The food was so good . we enjoyed the slot machines and the casino and hotel.  The rooms are so clean and beds are very comfortable . thank you for all
50,Loving their mobile contactless checkin no more waiting in line to check in. Digital keys for rooms are giving in the app with option to print out a key at a self check in kiosk which was smooth quick and fast. Never had a faster experience to check in to a room quick 5mins scanning our qr code on the kiosk and got our room keys right away!
50,I can only say the following: Don’t take my words as being gospel and truth unless you come and experience ALL the splendors amenities locale scene and view this property has to offer. I was so comfortable that I could not allow myself to leave the property to see other places and spaces. What a view! Plus the Bartenders are very pleasant.
50,The place was very clean staff polite and ready to help! Loved the no smoking policy. My husband loved the Eatalay! M Life desk was very helpful. Cashier staff were well informed helpful and nice. Cleaning staff were great! No problems in room. Plenty of elevators to get to your floor. Plenty of slot machines and table games. A lot of choices available with places to eat.
50,I was very surprised at how much it was a successful trip. The price didn’t match how great everything was and this is a very good thing. Great location and very clean. Of course beautiful Aria and Cosmo are right beside it but they are not worth the increased price especially if you’re on a budget.
30,Charging a daily resort fee when checking in after 9 pm and another daily resort fee when checking out before 9 am seems excessive. No refrigerator or coffee maker in room. Swimming pool not open until 9 am and closes at 7 pm.
50,Highly recommend the Park. It’s location is great Bavetts restaurant is amazing juniper lounge is always one of my favorite spots for great cocktails and good music. Primrose staff are wonderful and the decor is delightful.
50,Smoke-free hotel and casino was a plus for us!  The staff is professional and very friendly!  Primerose is a must eat at restaurant. The eggs benedict and pancakes are the best! Ask for Shelly the best server. A lot of new slots to play and WIN!
40,Got there on Friday night valeted and was already checked in with M Life app. Super easy and convenient which is what you could also say about the Park MGM in general. Everything is within a arms reach at the Park MGM. I had a lot of fun in the casino and cant wait to go back. I love the modern feel it has. It will definitely be an option whenever I visit Vegas
30,If you can avoid floor 24. This floor smells rancid and you have to hold your breath from the elevator to your door. If your room is one of the first like ours was be prepared to gag upon exiting the elevator.
40,The Park MGM is a great place to stay in Vegas! I love that it is smoke free. It has a great location for all activities Vegas. The Eataly has great options for food. The rooms were clean and nicely decorated. Check in and check out was easy and can be done online or at a kiosk in the lobby.
50,The Park MGM made our family gathering for my fathers Birthday a very memorable event!! All had a great time. The staff at the Front Desk and throughout the hotel were more than professional and accommodating. I would recommend this hotel.
30,The hotel was great. We had a promotion for 39 a night with a 39 a night (the dreaded resort fee.) plus a $50 a day f/b credit and guaranteed strip view. This is a steal of a promotion. We were there 4 days which should be $280 for the total stay. We did the pre-authorized check-in. Because there generally is a very long check in line at any hotel. I expected an up charge to hold an amount on my card there generally is for incidentals for whatever I expected 100 maybe 150 over the cost. but they took almost 700 out of my account. They don’t tell you to expect over 3X the amount of your stay to be deducted. I say this because it could for sure destroy someone’s trip if they were expecting a cheap Vegas experience.    The strip view was a bit of a let down we were on the back side of the hotel. Where we had a view of the Aria. And nothing more. I would hardly call that a “guaranteed strip view.” But we did however get a pool view. Whatever I didn’t complain about the location of my room we did get an earlier than normal check in for free. Plus who goes to Las Vegas to set in your room and look out the window all day.    The digital key card worked in the elevator but not my room so we had to make a second run to the lobby to make keys. Then on the last night the lock died it took an hour to get someone to unlock the door. But the Staff was great especially the behind the scenes guys like maintenance and security. The hotel was beautiful. The food was outstanding!!! With the $50 a day credit forced me to stay at the hotel for at least one meal. It was completely worth every second. The Pool area was spectacular. a bit small but there are 3 pools. The kids and families typically stayed in one pool so the small and medium pools were more for adults. I am not sure if it just worked out that way or if that was just my experience. The hotel or the pool scene isn’t a party environment nor a family environment. It’s more of a relaxing experience. As Opposed to say MGM Grand or Caesars. Location is Ok you are far enough from center strip to not have to deal with the amount of people yet close enough to jump into it.
50,I took my company there for the WOC and we will stay at the Park MGM for the foreseeable future. Great location on the strip and food options were only limited due to Vegas just now getting back on track. When this hotel is at 100% it will be a destination. Way to go MGM!
30,I normally stay at Luxor but decided on a change of pace.  Not up to expectations of a 4 star hotel. Check in process was extremely slow with only 3 representatives. Rooms were small and plain. No fridge or microwave in room. Had to go outside the hotel for a casual less expensive food court.
50,"Park MGM is perfectly located good restaurants solid pool with great staff and good rooms. The rest of this review is just going to be the phrase ""smoke free"" because I really am that excited about a hotel of this caliber being smoke free on the strip. Smoke Free. Smoke Free. Smoke Free.    Awesome."
10,The overall experience was terrible the staff was room the room look like something for a handicapped person the decor look like somebody threw up on it you have to pay for parking it's very expensive nobody tries to help you is disgusting you are only paying for the name I would never recommend anybody to stay there and I would never stay there again horrible it needs to be updated and upgraded for the money that they're charging you're paying for the MGM name that's it
30,Limited food venues were open and those that were offered inferior and limited choices. Impossible to get morning coffee as the only Starbucks always had a 30 minute line requiring us to travel to other places just to get coffee and rooms very dated
50,It was a true treat to stay in a nonsmoking resort in Las Vegas! We had no burning eyes headaches or the smell of smoke in our clothing. The room was adequate but not as upscale as the places we usually stay. Eataly had excellent food and not all the restaurants were open so we would expect more options for future visits. We will definitely try the Nomad (the top four floors of the hotel) for our next visit because the rooms appear more nicely decorated and there is a private pool for those guests. We look forward to visiting the Park again. We wish more casinos were nonsmoking.
50,We had an amazing experience from check in to check out. Staff was amazing and the room was perfect. The bed was so soft that we wanted to be in bed all day. I would definitely recommend my friends to stay.
50,Good place to stay. Nice pool. Good drinks. When our flight was delayed and we decided to just extend our stay another day it was easy to talk to someone and get that taken care of and keep the same room.
50,the hotel was very clean smoked free makes a bigger difference than I thought alot authentic itlalian feeling food options. and great location casino and pool. This hotel exceed my expectations. Literally at Primrose and for the best expresso martini  I've ever had. SERVICE WAS EXTRAORDINARY
10,My flight was delayed I let park MGM know this but they still charged me a no show fee. And are refusing to refund me. I booked via Costco travel and to my understanding Costco has been trying to reach out to them for a possible reimbursement to no avail.
50,Great place to stay. Very friendly staff check in is extremely easy. Very clean hotel rooms. Casino is nice. Easy access to the rest of the strip and neighboring casinos. We had a great time and will be back.
50,By far the best casino on the strip. Great service fun ambient great gaming friendly staff and nice rooms. From all the MGM properties Park MGM has it all located at the center of Sports and concert entertainment. This is the right place to stay and play.
50,Great location love that is is smoke free. The restaurants had great food and service we are a Best Friend and Eataly. The pool was a great setting as well. The only downside was that there was a homey game going on at the TMobile Arena and you could hear the noise and blow horns from inside your room.
30,"Stayed in the Nighthawk Suite. Nothing fancy big room terrible bed total disappointment. Do not fall for the ""wellness floor"". Should have stayed at the Aria or Nomad. Both previous stays there were much better."
40,"Really good location near of all needs. Staff very hepful and kind. The casino is non-smoking and smells pretty good. You have everything to eat at ""eataly"" from a breakfast to a very delicious gelato."
40,I'm so grateful to be able to visit Vegas again and also have a non-smoking casino to gamble in. Bravo. My biggest gripes: all the quarter machines have disappeared (I could count on two hands the number that are left) and STARBUCKS NEEDS TO BE OPEN LONGER HOURS. 7-2 doesn't cut it for early birds or those who need an afternoon jolt. My faorite thing about Park MGM? EATALY!!!! Must try!
50,We had a family visit and stayed in a nightingale suite. The visit was very pleasant and this property is located to many restaurants and entertainment venues. The restaurant at the Park was reasonably priced and tasty. We will be back to indulge ourselves.
50,A great place to stay !! The hotel was clean. Little Italy was a great place to eat and have some coffee or a drink. The desserts were amazing. The pool area was great. Have different was nice not to crowded. Wait staff did a great job.
50,This hotel (Park MGM) is wonderful and smoke free which is a huge bonus!! I wish they had refrigerators in the rooms but besides that the room was excellent. There was one bartender at the circle bar who was not very friendly.
50,I was wondering if any Las Vegas resort would ever be brave enough to go smokeless and it's finally here! The smoke free casino is awesome! No more choking and having to move to escape smokers. It was wonderful. Addionally the rooms have been updated. I was very pleased with my king room this trip. There is now a functional closet. Also a large TV that can be positioned so it can be seen from the bed. The bathroom and lighting are also updated. Still have the chair table and sofa in room. Park MGM will be on the top of my places to stay in Vegas going forward.
50,So glad we booked Park MGM!! The smoke free rule was such a literal breath of fresh air each time we walked in.  Eataly is a gem that we enjoyed more times than we would have thought. So easy to get to and quick service.  The floor plan of the casino is nice too bc you don’t get lost like in some of the other casinos.  We liked the location too - next to New York and across from MGM Grand made for easy access to many restaurants and attractions as well as the monorail.  Marked rooms at a 4 bc our Stay Well room did not have all of the advertised amenities functioning but the staff was quick to fix what we called on and overall we really liked the simple clean design of the rooms.  We’d definitely book Park MGM for a future stay!
50,Weekend getaway was quite fun staying at the Park MGM. Clean and smoke free casino excellent food and friendly staff made it memorable. Centrally located on the strip made it easier to get around.  Try the steakhouse!!!!
40,Staff was friendly and the rooms were very clean. However the rooms are a little outdated for the price. The pools are very small compared to other strip hotels but overall it's a nice clean place to stay. Location is great also.
50,Park MGM made my VEGAS trip AMAZING!!! Clean rooms Great Food Excellent Service!!!! Fantastic Promotions! I visit Vegas 4 times a year Park MGM is my go to place. You’ll love this place and their STAFF!
20,I have been to Vegas many times. I've always been impressed by the beautiful rooms until this trip. The room itself lacked any of the glitz and glamour I've come to expect from Vegas and to top it off when I looked out my window all I saw was a freaking wall. I was so disappointed. On a positive note I loved that the hotel and casino were smoke free.
50,The newly renovated Park MGM is a surprisingly wonderful 'non-smoking' venue. The rooms and property are clean fresh and entirely welcoming. Great selection of restaurants and bar facilities and the location is easily accessible from both sides of the strip.
50,Very clean property on the strip. Has great restaurants and pools. Non smoking casino is super nice. Close to the hokey stadium and you can see the Raider stadium from the rooms. Staff is very friendly.
10,I hate leaving negative reviews die anyone or any place but I just couldn’t find any positive experiences while staying here. Rooms are stripped customer service was horrid house keeping is absent and over all just a bad experience. Won’t return.
50,Josie at the front desk is great! She combined our reservations so we didn’t have to change rooms during our stay and got us a gorgeous king Mountain View on the 27th floor! The walls were sorta thin as we could hear the neighbors alarm and chatter if it was too loud but in Vegas that tends to be the least of the worry and didn’t affect our stay whatsoever! Will definitely stay here again in the future!
40,Right by T mobile for the games! Eataly kind of expensive. Fun band on Saturday night!Easy parking check-in and out. Connected to Aria and CVS on the corner.  Close to Hard Rock CafeNew York New York.
50,Very convenient location from parking garage to my hotel room. Love that I didn’t have to line up and check in person. Check-in was smooth through the MGM app!! Would stay here again especially since Eataly is in the building! Must try tiramisu clasico!!
50,Our family feels safe at this resort. We have stayed here numerous times and always have had an amazing time. The options provided allow us to not have to leave resort. We have recommended to our families and friends and they all agree.
10,Our experience at the Park MGM was hopeful to start but quickly turned sour. The quality of this hotel is comparable to a motel. It has no refrigerator and there is no late check out. Overall I would not recommend this hotel to anyone.
50,The title says it all! Staff are excellent the rooms are spacious and clean. My favorite place on the strip to stay. Love Primrose for breakfast pools are lovely close proximity to everything you want to do on the strip.
50,Staff were all very friendly & helpful. Mobile check-in a breeze. Rooms were ready hours ahead of check-in time. Delicious options for dining. Beautiful spacious and clean rooms. Location perfect. Never need to leave unless you want to. Looking forward to returning. Def have brunch at Primrose. Cute Parisian style cafe.
50,Great overall experience hotel was nice clean and neat. Staff was really friendly and helpful at all times. The location is convenient for the rest of the strip. Would have liked to have had somewhere to warm food but outside of that I would recommend this hotel.
50,This is a well kept MGM casino and Hotel When we come to Vegas this is our go to location and we will continue to stay here. The only thing I would add is I wish you had a few more eating options. Thanks
30,I book the hotel online through M-life. On my confirmation I was told I will be given a $50 food credit and $50 free play. When I checked In and asked the front desk they did not know anything about it. They directed me to the MLife representative which is in a totally different section of the hotel. She told me that I was given a special rate on the hotel room therefore I cannot claim the credit. I did not think I got such a special rate. It cost $500 for two nights with the lowest 2 queen beds room. I book my stay at the Vdara the next night with the same offer and the experience was totally different. The front desk immediately knew what I was talking about. She told me that the food credit has already been applied to my account and if I want the free play I would need to go to Aria. Needless to say Vdara will be my choice next time.
40,Overall the room was good. It was clean and cozy but thin walls could hear all the kids running up and down hallway all night. And the pool was nice but needed more service to keep it clean. Lots of garbage on chairs. And would’ve been nice if one of the pools would’ve been for adults only. Too many kids running around. Otherwise it was a good place to stay for what I paid. 👍🏻
50,Everything was amazing from start to finish. My only grip was Starbucks closed tooooooo early and it was no 24 hour restaurants available. The pool was fantastic gift shop housekeeping and all the security staff. I’m glad i keep my MGM stocks.
50,All around great room and service. Parking wasn’t a big hassle and I always had all my questions answered by friendly staff. I recommend 100%. I would stay again here on business or pleasure. Proximity to other venues also was key.
50,worst trip ever didn't have the best pleasant night left very disappointed with my family we were highly harassed from the people next door they kept calling security on us for no apparent reason bad experience with park mgm
30,Good centrally located hotel resort. Average price and average rooms. The rooms are clean and adequate. I enjoyed the smoke free environment. I would recommend this hotel. I would stay there again. The staff was great.
40,Park MGM is a nice place to stay. The fact it is a non smoking property makes it refreshing as it doesn’t smell of cigarettes. It is also next to the Aria hotel which is you’re a poker player is the nearest poker room (from there).
10,"Instead of recarpeting the Monte Carlo they should have just torn it down. This place is super basic no frills low budget crowd D list casino completely lacking in sexiness allure or anything else.    The rooms are spartan. The bed is not that comfortable the sheets are rough like sandpaper. The pillows are cheap synthetic filled. The bathroom amenities are minimal. Shampoo conditioner hand lotion bar soap (No body wash.) The facial tissue is rough not soft. The new fixtures in the rooms are just really basic there is not a single thing in this room that feels warm or comfortable.    Unless you get a room here for under $60 stay somewhere else.    ---    And I just came back to UPDATE this review because I just found out this crap hotel kicked me in the rear by overcharging me on the way out.    In the room there was a black plastic tray in front of the television. We tried to figure out what it was and then moved it out of the way. Turns out I think this was a mini bar device that was supposed to have candy in it or something? And of course fumbling with it triggered some charge for ""Entertainment Center"" which I have to fight with this hotel to remove now.    They also didn't bother to email me a copy of my receipt like most hotels do    And lastly they slapped on their ridiculous Resort Fee even though with my hotel program status this should have been removed.    Those last complaints about nickel and diming are unfortunately applicable to all of MGM it's just how they operate. But for the Park specifically stay away from this dump. You can find a nicer experience elsewhere on the strip for the same or much less money. This property just stank. Not like MGM cares about this review I'm sure."
30,That stench is all over Vegas and apparently made it to room. It's the sad reality keep the ac running 24/7 for circulation. We had 2 rooms 24-202 and 24-110 with AC it was bearable with the kids. We like the location as we usually hang on the south side of the trip with access to the tram. Overall we enjoyed the property as Mlife gold membership. Staff was very nice & accommodating.
10,The fact that our room did not have a fridge or microwave was ridiculous. We weren’t able to enjoy our leftovers. Not to mention the signs were extremely confusing when trying to get to the strip from the lobby. So we had to walk around and ask where to go. This was our first time staying here and Will not stay here again.
50,The experience was amazing lines were long but moved fast. I loved the restaurant options. Also My favorite was Juniper the Cocktail lounge. I can’t wait to return I will be staying at the Park MGM...
20,"Visited first week in June for 3 nights midweek my first stay since it was renovated from the former Monte Carlo.    First thing to know is that you will pay a mandatory resort fee of $39/day + $5.22 tax = $44.22. The only benefit I derived was in-room internet. With no coffee maker in the room you can trek to the lobby and stand in line ... or use room service where one cup is $6 for ""House Blend"" + $9 delivery charge + local sales tax + gratuity.    Check-in was slow with only 2 desk clerks (tho on Friday when I departed there were 5). There is a ""priority"" line for MLife members holding Gold Status or higher or possess the Mlife credit card. They are encouraging use of mobile check-in but impossible without a smart phone as many in life commented.    I was assigned to floor 23 room 116 on a ""Stay Well"" floor. Floor 23 is the first stop on the higher elevator so I liked being first off. (Elevators go 3-12 13-22 23-31.) I didn't find the ""Stay Well"" features all that useful. The air cleaner worked well but the hotel and casino are nonsmoking. The diffuser in the shower supposedly removed chlorine. Other features are explained online but I would have preferred instead soundproofing of the connecting door with noisy neighbors.    The room overall is very spartan with only one chair and round table; one rather uncomfortable couch; no dresser other than 4 little drawers sharing the closet with 8 hangers; and a safe and iron with ironing board. No coffee maker no refrigerator no microwave. Good supply of charging outlets (both 3 pronged and USB). The beds have a single mattress mounted on a low board platform. There is a sunshade and a black-out shade both operated with chain pulleys. One big screen TV with many sports channels (but not CBS Sports Network). Bathroom has large shower but no bathtub. Excellent lighting with a magnifying mirror.    Ice machine near the elevators worked fine with a beverage vending machine in the same ice room.    I had a strange encounter on my 2nd day. I saw a housekeeper in an adjacent room and said I didn't need housekeeping that day. She asked my room I told her and she insisted that I needed to clear out all of my stuff or they would do it. I looked puzzled showed her my room key and folder with number and she insisted I go with her to open the door. After seeing my room she stopped looked at the number by the door said to herself ""Oh these are the 100's"" (realized she was cleaning the wrong floor) and quickly left to close up the room she was cleaning and left the hallway with her cart abruptly. No apology just stone cold silence as she realized that she was in error.    The even numbered rooms ending in 100 102 104 etc. have a nice view of the 3 pools as well as City Center to the north. As with most large Vegas hotels it can be a long walk if your room is near the end of the hallway.    NOTE: If you have a resort credit like I did on a casino promotion know that your food tax will be deducted as part of the dollar amount you are allotted. My $50 went fast for 2 breakfasts and a beverage in the small restaurant by the lobby. One benefit is its proximity to Target across the street using the skybridge. Mlife has other better properties like Delano so recommend you look elsewhere if you can."
20,Room is cheaply made. No microwave in room no coffee maker for you. To mini fridge. The beds are really low to the floor. Room wasn’t ready when I arrived. Hostess didn’t care. I wouldn’t stay here again. Rooms were to pricey for not having nothing to offer
50,Took a weekend trip for the holiday. The hotel was very clean. Pool was clean. Casino was clean plenty of games...low minimums. Ambiance overall was great. Starbucks closes at 2-3PM which was the only downfall
50,"We checked in at the regular check-in desk rather than through our phone. It didn't take long. We got there about 11 AM and our room was ready.    We were in a Nighthawk Suite. Just a big room with two couches and two big TVs a king size bed a nice bathroom with a walk-in shower and a walk in closet with a safe in it. There was also a large entry way with a big console that was convenient to leave things like keys and such on. It was immaculately clean and in good repair. Towels were plentiful and thick. All the appointments were nice. We were there 3 nights and our room was cleaned every day and bed linens and towels were changed.    We never waited for an elevator. Hallways were sometimes a little warm but the temp was 110 so that's to be expected I guess. The elevators came very quickly.    It was so nice that the entire building is non-smoking. We really appreciated that.    If I had to score the place down on anything it would be the gaming. They did not open a craps table two of the three days we were there. They seem to be promoting crapless craps. The casino has lots of different kinds of slots and it's laid out nicely.    There doesn't seem to be a ""cafe"" there. Like for a breakfast or a quick sandwich. They do have a Starbucks that's convenient to the elevators. We ate one night at the steakhouse. It was good.    All in all we really enjoyed our stay at Park MGM and will probably go back."
40,This is the second time I have stayed at Park and I really like it there but sharing the parking with the arena is a huge negative. Very comfortable beds. No refrigerator is a negative as well but less so than the parking situation. They need to dedicate the first 4 floors to hotel/casino guests and the others to the arena.
50,"The Park is a great place to stay. Easy access to many other casinos and attractions on the strip - plus T Mobile Arena. We spent an amazing day at the pool. Try to rent one of the ""pool pods"" - it was perfect for our relaxing day poolside. The casino and hotel are non-smoking! Rooms are large and beds are comfortable."
10,It’s my & my husband’s 50th Birthday. Not even a glass champagne. No dressers in room. No glasses to drink water. No fridge unless you request and have proof you’re on insulin. Bed not very comfortable. Only benefit non-smoking. All restaurants & bars close at 10pm. $250/nt NOT worth it!
50,Park MGM is a great resort casino. Although I didn't have ample time to take a dip in the pool I will definitely be back. The air quality is amazing. Non-smoking is a big plus for me! Great for families or folks that prefer not to smell like smoke.
50,Best hotel and casino on the strip. We love the cleanliness of the casino restaurants spa and rooms. Excellent service all around. We have staffed there many times and will definitely return very soon.
40,I was there on business overall it was a good stay room was a lil but out dated and bed didn’t feel like a king size hopefully next time you guys can take care of me on my next stay. I really enjoyed my stay
50,Amazing service from the moment we stepped out of our car. Mauricio in Bell Services guided us through check-in and there was a lovely woman who helped us overcome our inabilities to operate in a digital world. The hotel is impeccably clean and the entire place is non-smoking (the only casino in Vegas that is). The food in every restaurant was fantastic I had great luck at the slots and we had a view of the TMobile Arena and surrounding area that was charming and quiet. While checking out we propped our door open a bit and security was right on top of it! Next time (and there will definitely be a next time...soon) we'll feel even more secure!!! Whether you are a first timer to Vegas or someone who comes up monthly or more often (outside of pandemics) like we do you will love this hotel and casino from bottom to top.
50,This is my 3rd time staying at park MGM. I really appreciate how easy the check in/out process is and location isn’t too bad either. Very close to mhm where you can cross over to use the monorail or take the tram wherever you need to go.
50,I really liked the hotel. I have 2 more reservations set for later in the year. Can't wait. I love the Eatality area and the pool. The service at the pool was great. Servers were always passing by making sure the guest was good to go.
50,Great fun. Loved Bavettes and Eately. Bavettes food and service is exceptional. Ate there twice. The room was clean and very comfortable. Wish there was a small refrigerator. The casino is clean and modern love the no smoking.
40,Overall the hotel was in a great location. The no smoking policy in the casino was a welcome relief from other casinos. The beds were comfortable. It would have been nice to have a small refrigerator and coffee maker in the room.
30,No acknowledgment about wedding day or honeymoon during 6 night stay. $39 a day charge for resort fees? Why? It's not a legal obligation to pay them but they will fight you about it. $35 a day if you should require a mini fridge. Seriously? Even Motel 6 comes with one one a microwave for far less across the Country. Just disappointed.
40,My Dad and I had a great stay for our birthdays. Looking forward to coming back next April or May for another stay. Would like to take in a concert there at the Hotel once they return. Overall had a great time there at the Property. Enjoyed the Pool as well!
50,Terrific location- being between NYNY and the Aria on the strip and near T-Mobile stadium.. Also love it being across The Park- outside eateries bars & fountains sitting areas. So lively during an event.  It was so refreshing staying in a NON-SMOKING hotel- you can sit & have a drink in the casino bar without breathing in smoke.  And of course having EATALY attached to the Park MGM is a definite + for coffee pastries pizza pasta etc. The 3 pool areas really nice and the room was just right- ask for a strip view!  Overall would stay there again for sure.
30,Dated rooms loud guests and sewer smell. This property needs to be updated. Also there was at least 2” of dust in the bathroom HVAC vent. We will not stay here again unless some drastic changes are made.
50,Had a wonderful trip to Park MGM. The location can not be beat. Center strip walking distance to City Center. Eataly and other restaurants make this a must stay. Smoke-free casino was exactly what I wanted. THANK YOU!
50,The MGM non smoking gem on the Vegas strip is a must stay. The service is great. Keep up the great price for the great services! More jackpot winners would be nice but great food and service all around.
10,I was charged way more than was quoted in my confirmation email. Even after resort fees and taxes my total was significantly more than what was on my confirmation. I did not use room service or anything charged to the room.
20,When you walk into the lobby it is a nice newer environment. It isn’t as big as some of the super hotel/casinos on the strip and that makes it much less chaotic. The fact that it is smoke free gets very high marks from me! The rooms on the other hand are underwhelming. There was no mini-fridge or coffee maker in my room. The air ducts were disgusting and the build up actually caused my a/c to not work and had to be serviced during my time there. During these times of COVID the expectation is that rooms are spotless and safe and this felt anything but. I will not likely stay here again.
30,"I was here back in 2018 - 2019 while they were still renovating the hotel from the previous l""Monte Carlo"". The rooms previously left a lot to be desired. I'm glad to see them completed. The hotel is clean and has food readily available but expensive !!!    The hotel has definitely taken a place of its own on the strip but gamers beware !    The slots are brutal !    After 4 days of random playing at all denominations and types of machines I hit one (1237$) handpay. For the same time period at your average tribal casino I have hit 10-30 hand pays . MGM is betting on the one time player to sustain it . Thats not how you develop new players !"
40,Booked a room with strip view and added early check-in but the room I booked wasn’t ready so we got downgraded to a room with pool view and got a $50 food/beverage credit and checked into a room that was already available.
40,I chose to stay at the Park because it was a non smoking hotel and casino. It is not flashy but it is classy in a retro kinda way.  My room was clean and while an obvious retrofit worked out just fine.  Elevators were fast noise from patrons was not noticeable and I liked the location.  Denny’s is right across the street along with a CVS and Target.  It’s attached to the Aria if you want a flasher look casino wise.  New York New York is next door on the same side of the Strip. It is very easy to walk to for expanded dining selections.    I will stay in the Park again in Sept. Non Smoking makes a huge difference to me.
50,We had a great stay at Park MGM. The room is modern clean and cozy. Easy digital check in with digital key card available. If you prefer a physical key card you can print it at a machine. There are lots of restaurants and the casino is smoke free. The hotel is centrally located and walkable to a lots of attractions. I highly recommend this hotel
50,It is smallish so it doesn't require endless walking. Great location in the middle of the strip. Recently renovated and is very nice- no gimmicks. Could use a food court other than the pricy Eataly. Bavettes was very good.
50,Wonderful stay at the ParkMGM. Will def do again in near future. Smoke-free environment is an absolute benefit. Strongly recommend to the novice Vegas traveler. Has all the bells and whistles of the strip without the super partying atmosphere
50,ParkMGM is my favorite hotel in the Vegas Strip! It's so nice to see a smoke-free hotel with nice decor - love the overall green tone that is so refreshing! The pool and the on-site restaurants are nice too. If you want to avoid crazy party people and just enjoy yourselves in a beautiful place ParkMGM is the one!
30,"Had an average nice stay. Wish there was drinking water and a coffee maker in the room. No room services were provided on any of the 3 days of stay because of ""Covid protocols and no request""? Didn't know we were to request !"
50,Will be my 16th time staying at Park MGM and let me say it won’t be my last. Other than the resort fee Park MGM has been my number one choice when visiting LaS Vegas. If you want and clean and spacious room park has it. Staff here are always greeting you with a smile.
50,Came for 4 days over memorial weekend & had a great stay. The hotel is very classy. The air didn’t reek of smoke slots and surfaces were nice & clean. The room was very spacious. I liked that it had a full table to sit & eat at instead of a small desk. The pillow were the best part plush & fluffy. We stayed on the 28th floor & it was quiet no disturbances. The parking structure was easy to figure out not like the Linq hotel which is a death trip. It had a parking counter which is good so you’re not driving around aimlessly. Just wish the restaurants would stay open later. I felt very safe well staying here. Our last day we stayed at the Linq & it was the worst decision. So unsafe there. I regret not just staying at the park mgm the whole time
20,Service is horrible no one had a 'can do' attitude. Was slighted both my FREEPLAY and Resort Credit due to 'fine print' issues. Not happy. One huge plus: non-smoking hotel/casino. It was so nice to be able to breathe and not smell like nicotine.
50,We were here to celebrate my sons 21st and husbands 50th bdays. It was most of our parties 1st time in Vegas and I am glad we chose to stay at the Park MGM. I have never stayed here and will make it my place to stay on my next trip.
10,Rooms are small and terribly laid out and look old even if they were “recently renovated”. The restaurant staff were rude and found every way possible to up charge without telling you. The room was relatively cheap when we booked but there was plenty of reasons why. Do yourself a favor and find a better hotel further down the strip.
40,Rooms are nice and clean. Loved the bathroom!  Pool... not the best. Too crowded. Suntanning beds too close to each other touching. Need to work on that.  Food at the pool was good.  I will go back again!
40,Most hotel staff were adequate. The casino being non-smoking is a very big plus along with the live music. House keeping staff were the best and obviously short-staffed. The dirt in the hallways and elevators was unacceptable. I do not believe my responsibility is to bring this to staff leadership's attention. Good management would have been aware of this.
50,Check-in: The checked in was done on line (using app) so it was smooth. The digital key was given to use. We walked straight up the room without contacting any hotel staff.    Room: We had a strip view double queen bed room. The room was clean. This is a non-smoking hotel so the air is clean. The ice machine is near by the elevator. There is no microwave or fridge in the room. Our room is on 28th floor (nomad building). There is a safe hairdryer and iron. There was no ice bucket in the room.    Pool: Check for the opening hours. Towels are provided at the pool.    Service: There is a tram to Bellagio hotel from Park MGM    Stay: The Primrose restaurant is nice. Food is good. We dined in once and took out once. Make sure you have credits and use the credits before checking out. If you have credits for food then they can be used for food/drink (not for tip).    Credits (if you have food and drink credits): the credits are applied to your food/drinks after the first night and are to be used on a single day. For instance the stay is 3 nights: Mon Tues and Wed. The credits are ready for use on Tuesday Wednesday and Thursday. Use the credits before checking out on Thursday.    Check-out: Quick and review your balance on the invoice.
40,Loved the fresh smell of the casino since it's smoke-free. Intimate size of casino was also nice. Loved the NO PARKING FEE (for now). Location was perfect and really like having Eataly attached to the hotel/casino. Eataly is a huge plus for this property.
40,Everything was great and great location my only problem was the price of the bucket of drinks at the pool way overpriced! $50 dollars for five drinks is a little rediculous but i guess if you need to get money back because of covid shutdown i guess this is one way of doing it
30,My overall experience of this hotel was average. I’ve stayed here previously when it was the Monte Carlo and to be quite honest the experience was the same. This hotel needs to be deodorized in someway. The restaurants were nice and there was no smell of smoke… But I was not overly impressed
10,The MGM hotels have hit a new low in experience for me.  The check in experience was one of the longest most frustrating and exhausting experience I have had at any hotel. I arrived at the hotel and was checked in at 1:50pm however I always not assigned a room at this time and was told that I would receive a text upon availability to pick up my room keys. I waited over 3.5 hours and witnessed other guests in the non-priority line check in and were promptly given a room. This was extremely appalling and distasteful. While being busy is completely understandable it's incredibly unreasonable wait 3.5 hours to get a room. The check in situation was reminiscent of a hospital emergency room with displaced guest tiredness waiting while others got to go ahead.  Additionally the lobby did not have any adequate waiting space and with no place to put personal items my group was confined to standing in the lobby for 3.5 hours. Not only was this an incredible waste of our time but one of my group members was afflicted with a foot related illness and had to suffer from lack of space to rest or a room to rest in. Upon notification that the key was ready after 3.5 hours we had to wait in a check in line again at which point the line had grown significantly with the evening arrivees checking in.  After waiting 3.5 hours for a room we were very excited to finally relax. Unfortunately upon entering the room we were hit with the strong smell of Marijuana. The air was very heavy and difficult to breathe in one person in our group began suffering from allergies due to the lingering Marijuana smell. This is particularly concerning because COVID-19 is still very present and it is still possible to contract. At minimum we expect a hotel room to be clean feel clean and smell clean. The housekeeping staff was incredibly kind and accommodating attempting to ventilate the room twice. Unfortunately the smell persisted for the entire duration of the trip. This was extremely unpleasant to return to each night.  This stay has been incredibly disappointing to me and was definitely a low of my entire trip.
50,This was a great location with lots of things to do places to eat and the casino was really fun. There are other casinos very close in walking distance. The tram was assessable. The shops were fantastic. The services were fantastic.
50,This is a great property with all the amenities you will ever need. Right next to the t mobile arena you can go to an event and walk to your room. Plus easy to walk to other places on the strip. Great food places all around you.
30,Room was clean but need was low to the ground and air conditioning was not up to par. Also starbucks closed at 1pm. I did like that it was smoke free and the location of the resort was very convenient.
40,This is the third time I'm at the Park MGM. I like how the room always fresh and clean. With smoke free casino I can enjoy being on the floor longer and spent more time at the slots.  The location of Park MGM is so good. I can spent three days in Vegas without car. All walking distant.
50,We really enjoyed our stay at the Park MGM. We liked that it wasn’t a huge hotel/casino and that it was non-smoking. The location was great. The staff was very helpful in every way. The room was clean and bed comfortable
40,Comfort cleanliness practicality. Not overwhelming. Not oversaturared with guests walking through casino and areas. Small casino but practical. Various food and dining choices. From low to high cost. For various taste buds.
50,My husband and I chose this property mainly because it was smoke free. It was a perfect stay with no issues. We had the Nightingale Suite and the beds were so comfortable! I loved the water pressure in the shower and we never had to wait on an elevator.
40,Amazing that its no smoking hotel. Only reason I give this 4 stars is because of the obnoxiously loud guests next door. Sounded like there were at least 10 people there. First time being restless in Vegas.
50,We stayed 4 nights at Park MGM and was upgraded to the Stay Wellness room since we were M Life Members which was the best thing that happened especially we were concerned about the COVID safety. Great!
20,I booked a specific room that came with a view of the strip when I arrived I was told the room I booked was no longer available and I was forced to stay in there basic room because it was too last minute on a very busy weekend to try and make other arrangements.
50,Nice non-smoking property on the Vegas strip. Clean comfy quiet room. Conveniently located near several other casinos with easy access to monorail. Nice pool area with several umbrellas and shady spots.
50,We loved staying at Park MGM. It is a beautiful property that is smoke free and has a really cool eating area called Eataly! We have stayed there twice now and the location is perfect!! We celebrated a birthday while there and it was easy to gather at Eataly and afterwards there was a fun rock band that played in the casino. We all hung out and danced in between playing the slits and tables!!
50,Never had to stop at the front desk for check in. My reservation was linked to an app on my phone which also acted as my room key. Clever technology in the parking garage made for easy parking. Every parking spot was illuminated with a red or green light at the ceiling. Green lights indicated an open spot. A single glance across the entire ceiling of the garage will guide you right to an open spot. Great amenities friendly staff great location.
20,To take mid day naps not the hotel for you.  The arena across the way is extremely loud especially during games. Also the roller coaster from New York New York is loud and you can hear people screaming on the ride till 12 AM
40,Nice hotel all around and great location I'd stay here again for sure but wouldn't upgrade to the strip view room wasn't worth the extra money. Casino was always lovely and fun MGM properties do a great job.
20,I was very disappointed about smoke free hotel.Next time put this sign on the top of your webside.I think it is VERY IMPORTEN information for people who are smoking.In all other hotels you can smoke in the casino!!!!
50,Enjoyed our small quaint room. It was in close proximity to everywhere we wanted to go. Bavettes steakhouse is a MUST. The salmon and filet mignon were top notch. I would recommend this hotel to everyone looking for a reasonable place with great location
50,We loved the location and the customer service. We were also very happy that it's a non-smoking hotel. The price of the hotel was very good and we also received a complimentary night. I will return in the future.
40,I had originally booked a stay at Park MGM in November of 2020 after they had reopened but then they decided to only be open on weekends and my stay overlapped into the week so I had to stay at a different MGM property. This stay was booked a couple weeks in advance and everything went perfect with the reservation process online. In fact I was able to complete the check-in process on my phone prior to my arrival at the resort. I checked in late on a Monday afternoon and was able to walk right up to one of the check-in tablets to get my keys. Once I had those I was off to my room. The room was amazing in terms of its simplicity and decor. The bathroom was spacious and the sleeping/sitting area was very nice. However the same door that closes the bathroom is also the closet/storage area. There were 4 drawers that would definitely not be enough for two people let alone one. Plus they only provide about 6 hangars so you would have to call for more if you needed them. The wall safe was in the closet area and had enough room to store valuables but it didn't work. The safe wouldn't accept a manual code or a credit card swipe. I didn't have much to store in there so it wasn't an issue for me. Check it right away if you need to use it and call the front desk if it isn't right. As for the Park MGM as a whole I love the non-smoking. It was refreshing to walk through a casino and not choke on cigarette smoke. Dining choices were very limited there which was disappointing. Primrose (Breakfast/Lunch only) was open daily and I ate there a few times during my stay. The food is plentiful in quantity and reasonably priced. I highly recommend it. Eataly was hit and miss. Half of the places weren't open so again you were limited on where you could get food. I wound up sitting at the Italian Wine Bar to order dinner since the pasta restaurant had a 30 minute wait. The food was good but service was lacking at the wine bar. I even had to ask for silverware to eat my lasagna. I wound up leaving the property for dinner the other nights since their steakhouse Bavette's was either closed or opened later than 4pm. I really wanted to try them and spoil myself but instead went to the Outback across the street. As for gambling I was disappointed in the selection of slot machines in the casino. Having stayed at other MGM properties previously I didn't see the same choices. I have my favorites and they were nowhere in sight! It's nice but I'll go someplace else next stay
50,Smoke free property the ONLY ONE in Vegas the layout of the property is awesome EATALY was great. Awesome pizza and pastries. The walkways are large and super relaxing pool area! Rooms are super large and modern.
50,It's great to see everything is back and functioning. It was a great trip with good food gambling and entertainment. I am glad that everything is open again and we have the option of wearing your mask if you are vaccinated. I recommend MGM Park and Best friends.
40,The room is clean but next door party really annoyed me party lasted until 4 am...others are fine.  The casino is wonderful everything clean and pretty  I will definitely visit here when I come back again.
50,This hotel provides everything a guest could need or want. Food choices range from grab and go to restaurant fare (steak or Italian). Room was clean roomy and comfortable. The best - No Cigarette Smoke!
50,Great location across the street from T-Mobile area. Easy to navigate lobby and casino. Lots of options for dining on property but easy to get to sister properties for other options. Valet was nice and quick.
50,If you need an island away from the CRAZY Vegas that you can find in so many other hotels this is the one. Excellent facilities and casino but not as intense as other places. The smoke-free aspect was a nice break for my lungs. Great food options. Clean rooms. Friendly service.
50,Great place to stay! Especially if you like hockey the arena is right across the street. No smoking on the property was a plus. The Big Apple Coaster is also right across the street. Eataly also had some great food.
20,The King Room was just ok. Nothing special. A bed couch and table thats all. At first I thought we are checking in a green painted room with standing shower but i was disappointed that it was all red and a bathtub so different from the photos posted on the websire.Also the room doesnt have mini fridge and you have to pay $35 for one which is absurd. Not even a coffee maker nespresso or even a water heater. No free water and you have to pay a daily resort fee of $39 plus tax total of $45. I rather stay in another MGM property but never again in Park MGM. Wouldnt recommend it at all. Though one good thing is that the people working at the front desk either morning or overnight have superb quality of customer service. I applaud them for that.
10,There were no rooms available at check in when I arrived at 7p. No one offer to take our luggage so we had to drag them around everywhere while we waited. Waited 4 hours and was lied to many times about when our room would be ready. Many upset ppl that night.
10,Used to be a nice place. Employees dgaf. I mean really nobody cares. Dirty room no drinks in the casino no reason to stay here... I'm a regular and I'm disgusted at what Park MGM has become. So trashy you couldn't pay me to stay here again. Denny's across the street is at the same level as this place.
10,"Outdated rooms that with old dirty carpet.    We walked into our ""suite"" which was an insult compared to the properties I've stayed at in Vegas before. The name change made me think an actual renovation occurred from the old Monty Carlo but we walked into a room straight from the 70's including the Forest Green velvet furniture and brass conduit up and along the wall to the roof to cover the wiring for the 70s lamp on the ceiling.    I immediately contacted my host at the Venetian and was given the same offer as the MGM with an actual luxurious suite..    I'm very disappointed with the MGM I had always enjoyed playing and staying at their resorts."
50,This location could not be any better along with amazing comfort. After a long night in Las Vegas these beds define a home away from home. If you need information or need to change your plans just pick up the phone in your room and let them take care of the rest!!
40,We recently met Hank Graae a security officer at the Park MGM/Eataly in Las Vegas. He was very friendly and knew more about wine than most sommeliers. We were very happy with the wine tasting he recommended. Be sure to visit Eataly the next time you are in Las Vegas!
30,Really appreciated being able to stay here with no smoking. Hallways were VERY dark with low ceilings. Room was clean but on the small side. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Online check in process with the ability to print your own room key once you arrived at the hotel was awesome.
50,Great location. Walking distance to everything you need. Non smoking casino is wonderful!! The beds are 6 out of 10. Pillows are 10+! Layout of room is very nice with window seat. Close to shopping & attractions. Food within casino is good.
40,Nice casino and resort in a great location but rooms are very plain and walls are very thin. Staff was very friendly. A lot of good restaurants to choose from. Virtual check in was nice. Parking was free but I don’t think that will last much longer.
40,Room was dusty when we checked in but it worked. Property itself was great and non-smoking which was nice. Restaurants were all great. Amenities were good pool was nice and service was good. If you don’t plan on spending much time in the room I recommend this property!
50,My husband and myself love staying here. It is the best hotel since there is no smoking allowed. All hotels should be no smoking. The cocktail waitresses are always coming around and offering drinks which is great! We don't have to look for them. We always tells our friends to stay here because it's one of the best hotel experience we have had.
50,Staff very helpful and easy check-in and check-out. Park MGM has easy access to the strip and to the parking structure. Out of all the MGM resorts we always stay at the Park MGM. Being a rewards member free play and $50 food credit is also a plus.
50,First off the bed was incredibly comfortable. We stay twice a year and I can’t get over how comfy the bed and pillows were. Also non smoking hotel and casino fir the win! Best place ever. We will always stay there.
50,Beautifully renovated rooms. Mobile check in/out is amazing. No lines!!! The parking structure has ample parking and the staff is very friendly.    We went for a vacation and I got an amazing rate for the Nightingale Suite.
40,I don’t typically leave reviews just because time doesn’t permit yet I read reviews to help make my decision. Hotel room was decent. Food was great and I really enjoyed the ambiance from Primrose restaurant. Staff was very friendly and helpful. The hotel ambiance was just all around good and I would stay there again and I am a very meticulous person about where I stay.
50,Great NON-SMOKING property! Clean good Casino layout. All the staff is friendly and competently trained to help and assist you wherever you need! The food we had was superb and completely satisfying!
10,3 star hotel dogs in a hotel no valet parking no smoking in casino no drinks in a room 1 hour to find a parking check in long line and wait ing time 40 minuts no complimentry drinks in a casino floor
30,I stayed here with a friend for a birthday staycation. I booked two double queen strip view rooms for a decent price. The rooms are what I would describe as an economy hotel room. There are no extras and no outstanding features. The tiny closet and bathroom door are one and the same as it is a sliding barn door between the two. You cannot have the door to the bathroom or the closet both closed or open at the same time. You have to choose. There was a strip view but it comes after a good amount of lower floor rooftop view. It was still nice at night. The room was clean but the carpet had a few stains. Bed was comfortable. They have 3 pools for standard guests and one for the NoMad guests. The pool area was well supplied with lounges and had prompt cocktail service. We ordered room service one morning and it came very promptly and food was hot on delivery. The fact that the whole place including the casino is non smoking is a plus. It is a well located hotel and an easy walk to T-Mobile arena . There is tram access to Aria and Bellagio. I think this is an OK place to stay if you are getting a very good price on the room and are not expecting a luxury stay or a lot of room amenities. The Eataly complex being located within the hotel is a plus. Some of the booths there are still closed but probably will open shortly as Las Vegas is supposed to get back to 100% occupancy on June 1.
20,Unfortunately I was there on weekdays and nothing was open but was not told that when I made the reservation. valet was very important to me and I was assured that there was valet service- well there wasn’t! The day we arrived the machines were all down and you could play anything til that evening.  The air conditioning in the room shuts off without movement so the nights were very warm in the room. The mattresses were also very uncomfortable. Only saving grace was employees were all very helpful.
50,High touch and high digital experience. No long lines for check in. The day before my arrival date I received email check in instructions. I downloaded the app and checked in. The digital key became available as soon as I arrived on premises. Directions to elevator were right on screen. Checked out by phone too. High digital and super safe not to meant easy! High touch client experience with the small count of employees I needed. We didn’t need much additional service. Easy to navigate property clean smoke free and roomy casino!
40,We stayed here at this hotel once when it was still the Monte Carlo and this is our first visit since MLife resorts revamped the whole hotel and casino. It definitely improved and updated the ambiance of the hotel which made for a relaxing stay for us. The location is great with so many prime hotels bars and great restaurants within walking distance. It was one of the more affordable hotels and we will definitely consider staying here again!
20,“Do Not Disturb” means nothing to housekeeping. Both morning they attempted to enter our room while we getting dressed even though the “Do Not Disturb” sign was on the door. Both days they room the sign after trying to enter and then tried to enter again. Didn’t feel safe.
40,I really do appreciate the free three night stay is that I have gotten over the past year. But being hotel occupancy in Las Vegas is so low I find it very strange that my free rooms overlook the dumpsters typically. But when I pay the $30 a night plus resort fee I get some very nice rooms and very nice views. I typically lose between one and $2000 each day so you would think that would qualify for something nicer especially when there are so many nice empty rooms at the park MGM.
40,Only thing that wasn’t good is the air room stated a little warm. But other than that the service was great and was in middle of strip where you could go any where easily. Great eating places in hotels around it
40,The resort itself was a great price for the five nights we stayed. It is conveniently located on the strip and it is easy to get to other resorts/casinos. The room itself wasn’t anything wonderful. We had a strip view on the 20th floor. The view was really of the strip which wasn’t a wide view due to the angle of the hotel. The room had really old light fixtures and the color of the walls wasn’t that great but we were not buying the place. The bed was comfortable. Housekeeping cleaned our room one day (per our request) but I did ask for fresh towels off their carts each day and gave them my trash/used towels. All the housekeeping staff gave me the items I requested and were polite.    The pool was amazing and there were plenty of chairs with umbrellas or chairs in the shade so don’t bother to purchase their chairs for the day unless you want a nice cushion or a nice cabana. They had plenty of pool towels and the service at the pool was great. Both servers we had were attentive but did not force people to purchase food/beverage items. The pool food was good.    The one downfall about the property (but probably Vegas in general) was there was no fridge in the room and most items such as food and drinks were costly at the resort. However there was a Walgreens and CVS located near by and you can buy alcohol and snacks at those places. There was also a Denny’s located across the street and it was a great price for breakfast. If you order carry out you don’t have to wait in the line to be seated and you can take it back to the resort. You can also check out the happy hour at the Hard Rock Cafe located across the street.    Lala Noodle inside the resort was our favorite and we found the meals to be reasonably priced for the area. We also had drinks at the Jupiter cocktail lounge and the drinks were also good there.
20,The hotel rooms looks exactly like the photos however in addt to the $400 security deposit you’re charged $45 a day for resort fees.  With the price of the rooms & the resort fees even the basic rooms should have simple amenities. None of their rooms have; microwaves or refrigerators but you can “rent” a refrigerator for $35 a day. It’s just strange we were there 6 days u could literally buy a mini fridge for the amount it would cost to rent for the duration of your stay.  This is a deciding factor for me when I book my next hotel. However if you don’t mind not having those items while on vacation the hotel is smoke-free clean and the rooms are minimalist.
40,We had a very pleasant stay at the Park MGM and absolutely LOVE that it is non-smoking. It is now our first choice on the Strip.    We had been there when they first opened and struggled to get checked in but it seems that the glitches in the electronic check-in system have all been sorted out. I'd definitely recommend it for a great location and nice rooms with large showers.    The only issue we had was a broken smoke detector that starting beeping before dawn on our last night.
50,Great hotel. Pools are beautiful. Non smoking is a great feature and deciding factor for me. The staff at my Cabana were wonderful! Security was present which for me was a comfort. I felt safe and the apmospher was great. I will be back. This is my favorite hotel.
50,Checked in from my car. Got room extra room keys in less than 5 minutes then went to my room. Very happy with MGM. Shower was great. Nice and big. Both beds were comfortable. Only flaw is wish they had a mini refrigerator. But I used ice to cool my drinks.
50,Amazing location great staff. They were super friendly and they got me in to my room super early and even upgraded me. The room was really clean and had a great view of the strip. The smoke free part is amazing I woke up early in the morning went down to the bar to get some water and juice and not a sign of smoke it was amazing!
50,This was absolutely wonderful and I look forward to staying again. It was clean services were excellent and the other guests were courteous. HIGLY recommend anyone to stay here from all walks of life!
50,Great place to stay that was non-smoking. Very fun with friendly staff. The blackjack dealers were helpful and actually wanted you to win. I also cannot stress how refreshing it was that it is non-smoking even with e-cigarettes. That was wonderful
10,Dated and small rooms check in was a disaster. Room had no towels when we checked in. Wifi was terrible. Gym was better than I expected but not all the equipment worked (like my treadmill elevation didn’t work).
50,Tim at Primrose made us feel very welcome while we are breakfast and waited for our room to get ready. Our room was ready early thanks to the check in on the app. Definitely recommend. Using the app prevented me from having to stand in a very long line.
50,We loved the casino restaurants location and pool. This is walking distance to everything smaller (in a good way) than many casinos so everything you need but no getting lost or walking miles to get a coffee. Everything is decorated in an understated but tasteful way complete with actual art.    We stayed in a Nighthawk suite it was a great value. Only room for improvement would be the rooms lack mini-refrigerator and have a dry bar (no sink) but for the money the room was amazing fantastic highly recommended.
20,Had Dinner at La Pasta La pizza some of the worst service and food I have ever has at an MGM Property. The room was tiny and the air did not work well. the staff at the hotel was nice and friendly. I would stay at New York New York before I go back here.
20,The room had no fridge and no microwave.the neighbors were noisy and the shower was flooded.the location of the room was far.the restaurants were mostly Italian.not the restaurants were not diverse enough
40,No smoking!!! Great location - a quick walk over the bridge to Target. Great staff. The pool is very average - three basic pools nothing unique. Wonderful food quality and robust selection of restaurants.
50,Great time security impressed me check in was quick room was cleaned up everyday you don’t see that anymore. Only thing you can hear what happens next door but other than that we had a great stay there
40,Overall it was a great hotel. The hours for the pool are not great it really should be open until at least 9 pm. The casino is pretty small but it is set up nice. Staff was very friendly and helpful. We had almost no complaints
50,Such a great stay!! The BEST part was NO SMOKING CASINO and venue!!! Will return that's a promise!!! Got reserved pool chairs but was put in the most shaded area next time will ask for longer sunshine! We liked the parking garage lighting system to identify open parking spaces also.
40,Park MGM has emerged as one of the best values in Vegas. It is above-average for a Strip property in terms of cleanliness layout luxury food/dining and very importantly- not overcrowded or ratchet! MGM did a great job on the renovation and it feels like a brand new property. Rooms are small but well-appointed and comfortable. Property is easy to navigate and a great location close to center Strip for exploring Vegas.
50,Have ZERO complaints. Check in was fast easy. I downloaded the app which helped significantly. Loved the digital key entry. Check out kiosk did have issues however front desk swiftly checked me out and sent me on my way to the Uber pick up area
50,Went down there with 13 other guys for a Bachelor trip. Everyone working at the Park MGM was friendly and helpful. The place was in a good location and within walking distance of Top Golf. Will probably be staying there again in the future.
40,The casino being smoke free was great but a waitress was nowhere to be found. And buying a soda for $5 is a little too ridiculous! The elevators and hallways were very messy. The room was quiet and very comfortable. Use online check in and check out because the lines are extremely long.
10,"Don't be fooled by the pictures!!!! If you normally stay somewhere else I recommend to stay there. It's somewhat nice in some areas of the casinos. Staff is somewhat friendly Soon as you get out of the elevators to enter your room your immediately greeted with a stale outdated 70's vibe (kinda depressing) throughout the walkways. Soon as you enter your room you can expect a 70's to 80's Era feeling with the overall landscape of the room. Stayed 2 nights the bathroom was barely updated but felt clean. Shower stopped working on the second night didn't bother to call in. Told the front desk checkout about the situation and said I don't think I'll come back for a second stay after my overall visit. Her response was ""ok that's fine"" clearly could careless about customer input. Bottom line is you pay for what you get. It's all good there are hundreds of hotels in Vegas I'm just trying to help someone not make the same mistake as me."
50,I have stayed at various hotels in Las Vegas. This was my first time at Park MGM and I will certainly stay here again. Guest rooms were very clean roomy and comfortable. The pool are was nice. Staff throughout the place was very helpful. Restaurants were limited in hours of operation but the food was great. I highly recommend Park MGM.
30,The Park MGM is a decent hotel with comfy beds and a new mobile check-in and mobile phone access feature that works well; however they currently have no in-room coffee or fridge which would be fine if they had easily accessible quick breakfast and coffee but the lines for that are ridiculous. They need to re-think that experience.
40,Good location and priced reasonably. Eataly has good restaurants but not all were open. Close to CVS Denny’s for quick breakfast and the Crystal shops were you have the best designer stores. Also use the tram to go to other hotels.
20,Room was nice size. Hand sanitizer stations everywhere in the hotel. Need more waitress at the slot machines area. I woke up to bed bugs bites all over my chest area . Never had anything like this before in other hotels in Las Vegas.
50,The security guard John Black helped us resolve an issue we had encountered during our stay at the park MGM. He was friendly and very reassuring that the customers’ safety is priority. We are very thankful for how he professionally addressed and handled our situation.
50,This is to be my favorite hotel in Vegas now because it’s non smoking. I set foot in others and instantly notice the difference. My friends and I are returning in 3 weeks and are looking forward to another stay.
50,A casino you can actually breathe in! The Eataly and other food choices were great. Pools are beautiful with plenty of shade if needed. Spa services were amazing. Easy checking in and checking out. Great for the whole family.
30,We had a great stay. Everything is smoke free even the casino so nice. Great location great restaurants. There are a few pools nothing exciting there some shallow waters for sunbathing but no lazy river or waterfalls. Really fun crowd. Oh the bed was very comfy too!
50,This was my first time at Park MGM. Mobile check in was quick and easy printed my own room key at the kiosk. Loved that feature. Loved that this was a non-smoking resort. I found the hallways very dark and kind of scary when alone. The room was very nice. Very clean and had everything I needed. Didn't try any of the restaurants so I can't review any of the food. Already rebooked for July. Perfect location and close to everything.
50,So pleased to find a hotel where one is not constantly battling against the prevailing smoke residue found in most other LV casinos. Wish they would open up La Noodle and other eateries though. Would love a poker room added soon.
50,This is my 2nd stay at this property and I will seek it out on my next visit as well. The whole place was renovated a few years ago so it seems brand new. Has 3 pools which are very nice. Staff is friendly and accommodating!! Great value and excellent location in the heart of the Strip!!
30,the old Monte Carlo is now the New but still dated Park MGM. loved the non smoking hotel and casino the restaurants were nice (primrose and Eataly). the location is decent as you can get to quite a few other casinos very easily. Vegas is coming back but overall average in terms of rooms. Had a problem with a non locking room door and the MGM App really didn't work with the digital key which was frustrating as check in could have been very easy.
40,For a lay your head down hotel after a 10 pm arrival the room and the hotel left me very impressed and made me hope all rooms had a mini fridge like ours did. I liked how the hotel room to the strip was a nice easy walk.
30,The room was extremely bare no dresser no wash clothes sink / shower didn't drain well. I know your in Vegas for the entertainment but seriously you could make the room a little better than a Motel 6.
30,The room was okay nothing extravagant. I noticed the hallways are not that clean and it needs sanitization. I know that CDC allowed no face mask for vaccinated people but they should still enforce the distancing on the elevator atleast. and still must take precautions.
50,We are a older couple and the room the was too far from the elevator for us. It took us twice as long to get the room. The bed was hard and not comfortable. The room felt different from when we stayed before.
40,The room was excellent and clean but hard to get something to drink as I was playing the slots. I would stay here again without any problems. The front desk staff was excellent. The only problem was getting some drinks.
30,No fridge no coffee maker. Room was ready 3 hours late and no one cared. High resort fee and I didn’t even get to use the amenities. Overall very disappointed in my stay. Many restaurants were not open. If everything in hotel is not open resort fee should not be charge
40,It was a little dated and the rooms didn’t have the best view but the bright side was that it wasn’t crowded as other hotels. The only thing I really had a problem with was that there is NO FRIDGE! Otherwise it would’ve been perfect.
20,Ac would shut off at night while you were sleeping. We did not call as we did not want to wait in the room for someone to fix it and not be able to go out. 2 coffees and 2 sandwiches was $40 apparently being closed for some time required me to pay for it all in one weekend. Non smoking casino if you are into that. Overall we will not be staying here again.
50,From the customer servicelocationfood and the fact they are one of few that don’t allow smoking in hotel is why I’m saying it’s worth every dollar. Not one thing to complain about had amazing time staying here. Loved the security measures and the detail staff payed attention too.
40,Would definitely come back and recommend this hotel to friends and family. Park mgm is smoke free the lobby has a huge root of a tree the Decor is boogie. Haven’t really explored much else rooms were clean.
50,"Finally you can stay on the strip without smelling like an ash tray! And if your like me your allergies can relax with the smoke free policy. The restaurants in this property were very accommodating to dietary restrictions without making you feel like ""that person"". Overall wonderful upgrade since Monte Carlo."
50,Park MGM is our go to casino in Vegas. The rooms are very comfortable and the location is in the center of the strip. The common areas and pool are pleasant and not as crammed as other casinos. The dining choices are varied and all of our meals have been solid. Also it is non-smoking which is a huge positive
40,The room was easy to access via the MGM app and the room was clean and comfortable. I wish more late night things were open but I do realize that is coming soon. The rooms are easy to get to very near check in desk.
50,It was my husband‘s and my 21st wedding anniversary. I enjoy my stay. I did not win any money but I still enjoyed myself very much the food was great I really like that the Starbucks was on the property
50,We had a great time accommodating people at hotel and everyone was exceptional nice will stay again disappointed no refrigerator in room and not enough towels but parking was good and free very important as we can snd went a few time
40,The rooms were very clean and the sheets soft. TV is a basic Dish package. Movies available like everything else for a price. The location is fantastic right next to where the Knights play close to the New York New York MGM Grand Bellagio and the Paris. Parking was complimentary but keep on eye on that when staying at any MGM properties that could change in a heart beat and would be a deal breaker for me. I stayed on a promotion all in it came to about $87/night which is a great rate for strip hotel. Given the same circumstances I would definitely stay there again.
50,I’ve been coming to Vegas for over 30 years. I played blackjack yesterday with the nicest and most helpful dealer of all time. His name is Boris Reyes. What a very nice man. He made losing as much fun as winning.
40,it was good and staffs were friendly... very good location... only problem was rooms didn't have fridge no complimentary water and you basically have to pay everything .. over all the experience was great
50,This is a great hotel to stay for the value! The staff were very helpful and very courteous. The bartenders at the pool were very friendly and fun! The bed was very comfortable as were the pillows! The EATALY restaurants were also delicious!
50,The place is clean and comfortable to stay while in Las Vegas. The hotel is closed to strip and very accessible to walk in the strip. We will be staying here again in our next vacation. Highly recommended.
40,Not to bad I need the biggest thing is that they need more restaurants more sports bars the smaller places to go eat better breakfast area other than that it was good rooms are nice very clean good time
50,Vegas was a great time loved everything about park mgm from the food to the location to the walking distance to other mgm properties was awesome. I’m definitely staying there again and can’t wait to visit in August
20,Over packed not enough Employees for the crowd. Hour long lines everywhere. Rude Employees. 1/2 waits for elevators. Cabana service terrible. We had a Company party spent over 10000.00 and expected to be treated a bit better.
40,We had a very nice stay; however rooms are without fridge's or coffee makers and if you are traveling down for sports it makes life much more difficult. Lines for food and services are almost unbearable.
30,The best thing about this place is that it's smoke free even the pool! The rooms are small and not so nice. Ate at 2 places on property and the food was God awful but they are right across the street from NYNY(another MLife property) and Chin Chin was super tasty!
30,Lack of flow@check-in  Bathroom shower ceiling had mildew.  Others people's hair in shower.  Missed dirty spots in shower.  Tissue was soaking wet.  Couldn't easily find the ice machine.  Didn't notice any signs for the I've machine  Concierge wasn't very friendly/ helpful
30,The Park is awesome and beautiful. The staff was awesome. The reason I gave it a 3 is because the beds are to low. I several massive back surgeries. Getting in and out of the bed was a challenge. The bed was also close to the wall. Being my right side is stronger I have to sleep on the side of the wall.
30,The room with king bed is beautiful and clean but!!! not microwave not minifridge not cofeemaker really bad that or everithing you have to go down the room service nice but prices high and small amount of food please advice in the pool area some chairs with umbrella you have to pay for that  have not reserved sign and they can charge you $100 for just sitting there
50,By far the best room I’ve stayed at. Super comfy and the staff was amazing. Had no problems at all. The room was super spacious and bathroom was very spacious as well. Couldn’t of asked for a better room
40,Staff is the best part well no smoking might be a tie. The rooms are not overly fancy but I don't really tend to spend a lot of time in the room. Close to shake shack. Luckily the tram gets you to the Bellagio in no time. Beats walking and taxis.
30,The lady who checked us in was pleasant and efficient. Thank you for that. The room was located on the T-mobile arena side and we were woke up around 8:30am by the sound of bass and apparently they had a home game and that area is like a rock concert with music blaring. Had 22nd floor and it lasted over 4 hours until we left the room. The room was a decent size and the shower pressure was amazing. None of that water trickling shower head. The windows could really really really use a washing. It almost takes away from the great views when you have to look through dirty windows. Had views of the T-Mobile arena/park area. Raiders Stadium and the Red Rocks. Wish it was clearer though. Was frustrated with the mask policy change the day before we arrived. Too late to cancel. Wasn't ready for that. Felt like we got button hooked on that. Eataly was a nice little area although not our type of cuisine it seemed to have a good vibe there. The cleaning stations have since been removed which was also nice since we're not out of this yet. The new overpass walkway was a bonus too.
10,They did not have my room when I got there And the service was bad in the checking line I would not go there again.The. Management Where unprofessional they had no idea what they were doing they look lost
50,I absolutely love the fact that this is the only smoke free hotel/ casino. It is so clean and well managed. This is my second time staying and I must say that every one is also so nice and respectable from when you walk into the resort to when you leave. 100% hands down my favorite place!
40,Great place to stay on the strip. The location is pretty central. The staff are wonderful. Dealers were great. I live the smoke free casino! Rooms are good not exceptional but I’m only sleeping in them.
30,Not that modern it looks like a motel they just repainted it. So it looks new but i was expecting a 5 star hotel should be modernized lots of staffs they should put replace some of the rooms it was like motel expensive motel though
40,Had a nice stay at the Park MGM. Very clean hotel comfortable room and for those that enjoy a nice shower the water pressure was great! Location of the hotel was great and plenty of good eats nearby at Eataly or just across at the park adjacent to the T-Mobile Arena.
50,This newly re-named and renovated hotel is smoking free everywhere. The hotel is covid safe with sanitizers free mask at the desks and safe gaming areas. self parking is relatively easy. The only issue is very easy to miss the turn to the hotel entrance due to unclear directional signs. Google not a great help this time
50,I love the fact that you didn’t have to walk down a long corridor to get to your room. We stayed on the 17th floor and all the suites are right off the elevator. They had live music on Friday night which was a pleasant surprise. The location of the Park MGM is perfect for walking the strip giving you convenient access to many other casinos. They have plenty of outdoor seating in “the park” with LED lighting for ambiance. It was a very nice getaway.
30,We went for my daughter's 24th birthday I had never stayed on this side of the strip and she had never been to Vegas.It was hard to figure out where anything was inside and outside of the hotel. There were no directories or maps in the room and to get to the strip you have to either walk through the hotels and then on the walkways going over the strip. The restaurants are great the casino is small and the rooms are clean but have bare minimum amenities. Three pools are fantastic and great service outside too but I will not stay here again mostly for the location.
50,The stay was great very clean and comfortable beds and shower was very nice had a safe no fridge but had ice vending down the hall and casino and food there is great only thing is if you use the room key on the app the signal in the elevator is not too great
30,The room was decent. Checking in through the app could have been a little more user friendly. Suggest getting a room key at some point otherwise you may get locked out of your room early. Restaurants were open but hit or miss on hours.
50,Everything from the safety concerns the location staff and food was great. Already planning my next trip. We checked in on a Tuesday out on Saturday which is great if you prefer a more laid back but still exciting vacation. It was also great using my M Life rewards.
20,Wouldn’t stay there again. No coffee maker in room or comp water. Asked for wine bottle opener and wanted to charge us $12. Beds and pillows were hard. Half the restaurants were closed and the ones that were open closed by 9 or 10pm.
50,Friendly staff. Somewhat expensvie amenities such as cabana rental for $475. Prices have gone up at all hotel/casinos after pandemic but Park is in a good location. I'd recommend they construct a restroom closer to the North Parking area. We will stay again at this property.
50,Staff was great. It was sooo clean. I loved every bit of my stay. I’m not sure if I can make this a two-hundred character but the pool was amazing. And everyone I talked to on staff was so friendly and had a smile of their face.
50,King Standard room was very comfortable large table for eating or work window seat is like a couch plus a nice chair. Helpful staff great location and best of all.... smoke free ! Yes the whole place is smoke free... all rooms casino and restaurants. EATALY located on ground floor although way smaller than NYC.
30,A/c would not cool below 79. This does not seem like much but it makes sleeping uncomfortable. This has been an issue since the remodel. I will only stay here in October thru April going forward. Everything else is fantastic.
50,I had the most wonderful stay! This was my first time visiting Vegas and I was overwhelmed by all of the hotel options — I decided on Park MGM mainly because it is smoke-free other factors were that it is an MGM brand and the price was good. I arrived earlier than expected and was able to check in early. No crazy lines to check-in! Every time I called the desk someone answered. The three pools were lovely with both sunny and shady spots and weren't overcrowded at all. The room was very clean and comfortable. The location was awesome as well — the only car rides I needed were to/from the airport which were very quick rides. I'll stay again!
50,My experience with Park MGM was positive and an overall enjoyable time. The one improvement I would say they need is to include in-room refrigerators. This seems to be commonplace everywhere else and I think the guest experience would be greatly improved by doing this one additional enhancement.
50,The Park MGM will be our pick in the future for all vacations to Vegas. The smoke free environment makes a huge difference. Beautiful elegant room. Great pools. The Eataly is a good quick option to grab a bite.
50,My daughter son-in-law and I stayed in small suites on the same floor. Both suites were spacious and very clean. Park is located so it’s easy to go to other MGM properties. The Park has great eateries and we had a good experience in the casino. I would definitely recommend staying here!
50,The hotel is convenient to other sites on the strip and I found the rooms to be refreshing and modern without the heavy furniture you usually find.  Pools were great - all were open and you were able to find an open chair.  We like Italian food so all the options in the food court were awesome!  This will be my hotel of choice on next visit!
50,My husband and I really enjoyed our stay. The rooms were clean beautiful and exceptionally comfortable. Easy parking. I loved that the casino was smoke free. I will be recommending Park MGM to friends and family.
20,The room still had a shower curtain in it. The room was very small. Not a lot of amenities that would support the price they are charging. I had two rooms and spent way too much for them. Definitely wouldn't recommend.
20,Bathrooms with and clean to my satisfaction they will have cleaned every day had to ask going five times for the bathroom to be cleaned properly I feel very hurt I felt like I was living in a culture dish
40,It was time to unwind and take a solo vacation and i decided to come to Las Vegas and check the Park MGM The non smoking property was the biggest draw for me. Casino floor with non smoke was amazing even walking around inside and out by the pool with no smoking was a game changer especially here in Las Vegas.
50,I have stayed at this Resort/Casino a few times and it offers a pleasant atmosphere. It is smaller but has two pools security presence and staff that offer great customer service. Food options are good if you want to stay inside during your visit. Close to many entertainment options including the Areana Park Theatre retail shopping such as Burlington Marshall's Ross Walgreen CVS within walking distance. At first I wasn't sure about staying there but after jumping in I have been pleased with the offerings here. It would be considered a 'quiet' environment vs. the loud atmosphere at the bigger casinos.
40,Old Monte Carlo refurbished and great stay for $35/night (plus $39 resort fee).    Pro's: Great location near Aria and across from New York New York. Rooms are appealing and beds comfortable. Nice pool complex. Eataly offers pizza by the slice espresso and gelato. Best part of the hotel!. Hotel offered electronic room key on your mobile phone with MGM app.    Con's: No coffee maker or fridge in room. They have a Starbucks in casino but operates at limited hours (7AM-12PM?). Few places to eat on site.
40,Went with 3 couples two of us celebrating 25th wedding anniversary’s. Trip was good hotel is clean and nice. It’s not the Bellagio or Aria but suits it’s purpose. Emailed the hotel the week of arrival explained 6 of us were coming and 2 couples were celebrating their 25th wedding anniversary asked if there was any upgrades available even at a discounted price and their answer was the best we can do is get you all on the same floor. I guess a room with a view may of broke the place. I’ve been to Vegas at least 15 times and always stayed at a MGM Resort  you get some discount from M life but I think next time it’s gonna be Caesar’s Resort.
30,It was an average room with no refrigerator and the advertisement was wrong said it had a lazy river and there wasn’t one there! The staff was very friendly. Just very disappointed of the advertisement of the pool
50,Wonderful location and experience. The food was excellent. Everyone was helpful I don’t know what else to say about this resort. I will definitely be back. More pool time and hopefully I’ll win some money!
40,Good gaming and friendly staff all around.  Lack of opened food outlets for dining outside of their Italian food area Eataly.  Variety of slot machines. Not too over crowded like some of the other local strip casinos.
50,This is always my first choice because of the non smoking casino. The property is always clean and well maintained. We used the app to check in and used keyless room key. Love it!!! So easy and fast. Our room was spotless and the beds comfortable.
30,Property is clean and has easy in and out access to the strip. Hotel room walls are paper thin so you hear everything from hallway noises outdoor noise and running water from the next door room. No early morning coffee available until 7am M-W of our stay. We walked to Starbucks at New York NewYork to get coffee at 6am. Lack of open restaurants and what was available at Eatly was overpriced for the amount of food and not a variety. Go to Patisserie at the Aria for gelato sandwiches or pastries better price point and large portions. Also New York NewYork America has variety on their menu and not overpriced. Also during our stay there weren’t many open tables to gamble. All spots were taken and the hotel didn’t open more tables. They had plenty closed tables so we gambled at other properties.
10,"The lobby is gorgeous it ends there. They hide the $100 per night deposit in the fine print instead of on the ""total due at hotel"" which is ""tricksy"" as one of their own employees admitted. The room felt like a motel 6 except even a motel 6 gives you a fridge. The fixtures and furniture looked cheap and mismatched not artsy or eclectic. As an artist I also don't understand how a bunch of framed old post cards is a part of an ""art program""? Most of the other art just looked like print ad photos from a magazine nothing like what I saw online. An all red alcove above the bed is also incredibly aggressive and not relaxing in any way. The bed was so uncomfortable i had to pay for a massage after 1 night in it. The sink is flat so be prepared to rinse your tooth paste spit with extra effort. The shower was small and dark. Even the tp was rough. They say ""smoke free but we walked behind a group of guys on Monday who openly smoked even as we passed multiple security officers and casino floor employees. I wasn't expecting to get a lung full of someone's disgusting cigarette so it was extra displeasing. We paid $225 for a cabana. They put us at the North pool which lost all sun by mid afternoon so what was the point?? With us paid until 6pm we gave up trying to enjoy sun and tried to nap in our cabana instead. A guy cleaning up towels woke us for no reason other than ""I didn't see you moving"" like NO we were trying to NAP! so we gave up all together and just left early. It was definitely not worth the money nor was it the experience we had hoped for. Our pool server was incredible she was one of the only highlights of the day. The pool side massage therapist was very good as well. Thank lawd I got the massage because again I woke up with a stiff neck and shoulder from the pillows and bed in our room. Eatily was mostly closed but it all looked the same. (Apparently Italy only boasts curred meats on bread according to Park MGM?) As a 15 year bartender I was appalled at the service we got at the coffee shop. The line was long people were having to gather while waiting for coffees yet the barista moved at a bored glacial pace. Also I didn't expect brioche when I ordered a breakfast PANINI. Brioche and panini are not the same. I will NEVER understand how they get away with ""resort fees"" for things that are a part of the hotel or that you don't even use? Again a motel 6 doesnt charge extra fees in the name of their damn pool. It's an amenity it's part of the draw to the hotel! And to say it covers spa and gym when those things still cost extra or aren't even open??? It's a scam to take more money while not actually providing anything extra. I'm a Seattlite I've been taking trips to Vegas 3-6 times a year for little breaks for years. After the last several disappointing Ceasars resorts experiences I decided to try MGM again. The truth is it's now all the same. These hotel chains spend all their money paying out corrupt CEOs instead of investing in their hotel quality and front line staff and it shows. It's now $30 for 2 cocktails to cover all of their poor decisions. This was the worst Mothers Day trip in my 21 years of motherhood. Las Vegas used to be my home away from home but I don't know if I'll ever go back after yet ANOTHER lack luster experience. Boo yourself Park MGM."
30,Let me start off by saying our expectations were set fairly high as we were told this was a 4 start hotel prior to going here.    Well I have no idea how they based their rating of this hotel as 4 star but I would have rated it a high 2 or low 3 at best. Once you are out of the lobby the halls are dark and dreary.    The rooms weren't that much better. The TV worked intermittently the AC marginally kept the room cool. The sliding barn door used to close the bathroom was inadequate and missing hardware. Tile on the bathroom was literally coming off the wall in places. The carpeting and furniture (the table and one chair) was showing their age. Add to this the noise from the T-Mobile Arena at times was ridiculous. Considering we were told this hotel was recently updated/overhauled I didn't see any obvious signs of this ever happening.    Now lets talk about the food. Everything from the small shops the the restaurants were grossly overpriced. We made the mistake of getting a takeout chicken sandwich and some chicken tenders that cost us $50. One of the restaurants wanted $23 a slice of pizza. That better be pretty damn good pizza for that price. If you want good food at a reasonable price walk across the street for more varied choices better quality and at reasonable prices. Don't be suckered into buying at the hotel.    Staff members lost their collective minds of you lowered your mask to take a drink or eat something to the point where it was maddening. Now on to security. They were everywhere! Most noticeable were the guards at the elevators. I don't know why they were guarding the elevators because you needed your room key to go anywhere. Maybe they've had a problem with elevators missing in the past.    For the most part the security members were very nice. They were helpful and would occasionally ask you to raise your mask. It was obvious that they had enough of dealing with this and personally didn't appear to care one way or another.    I probably would not stay here again seeing how many options there are on the strip. Many of which looked to be in better condition.
50,Not only was the room clean. The location is right in the mix of everything! The beers were cold. The machines were hot as well I get a hand pay which was great. I did check in and have an issue with the safe but the engineer team was up in the room within the hour to deal with the issue.
50,It was great trip to stay in Park MGM.  Staff was kind and food was great!!  I really want to back again soon...  My family had a great time..  and want to strongly suggest this hotel.  I’m sure you’ll love and enjoy this hotel!!
50,I stayed at this hotel on my resent trip to celebrate my birthday. I stayed with my family there. The location of the hotel is excellent there ir a pharmacy acceso the street marchals ross target and more stores. The staff was amazing as well I would definitely stay here again.
50,Nothing special at Park MGM. But it is the perfect place to stay value wise. Middle of everything. Waiting for the clubs to open up at Omnia and XS. but for now the trip was very casual. This is i think my 4th time staying here and always had a good experience
50,It’s not permitted to smoke at the resort at all so if you don’t like the cigarette smell of the casinos this is the place for you. Come and breath the clean air! Also staff super nice and welcoming.
40,Loved the fact it was a smoke-free hotel and all staff were very friendly! The location was perfect. I would definitely come back for more stays. I have will be sending my friends and family to Park MGM for all future trips!
50,Excellent electronic check in process easily accessible elevators very clean room comfortable beds any items needed to restock the room were accessible excellent and helpful staff simple check out totally enjoyed the pools. No Mad is superb!
10,Booked my trip through hotels.com for 2 rooms little over $600 not a bad price. Upon landing my card was charger $45 more than the remaining balance then upon check in im charged another $300 resulting in over $1000 for my 2 rooms which werent worth it at all. If you can stay anywhere else please do.
50,Great place to stay. Friendly staff clean rooms and close to the action. All that and smoke free too!!!The restaurants on property are great and we would suggest Bavette's La La Noodles Primrose and La Pizza La Pasta as all are fantastic.
50,My fiance and I stayed here for four nights and it was fantastic. The staff is friendly and it's mostly central on the strip. Would recommend to any guests coming to Vegas looking for a central location to have the best time.
50,We decided this is the only place we will stay in Vegas. No smoking on the property is fantastic! It’s amazingly clean. The linens are crisp the towels are fluffy the water pressure in the shower is great and the bed is super comfortable. I slept 9.5 hours our last night there. It also has a great location on the Strip. There’s no refrigerator or coffee maker in the room. But there is a Starbucks near the lobby.
30,Room was very dusty. Broken objects like phone chargerand the way the restroom door is design gives no privacy. It's like a sliding closet door. Not much food variety. Feel like it's a downgrade from Monterey Carlo. Rooms and hallways dark. Only thing I liked was bed was comfy and casino was better
50,The most important standout of the Hotel and Casino was the security Outstanding I felt truly safe! The staff at the pool area were very pleasurable and respectful the service was exceptional! The different food area was new for me I will need to return to truly experience it better.
50,Great non smoking hotel in Vegas with friendly staff and comfortable rooms. Long lines for Starbucks in the morning is the only small complaint we had. Convenient to see a hockey game or show at T-mobile arena. Would consider returning to this hote
50,Park MGM is an excellent mid-tier middle of the strip property that is NON-SMOKING. It isn't packed with partiers but it is very comfortable and has reasonable table minimums mid-week. The craps table was generally $15 minimum which is higher than I prefer but $5/10 tables are a thing of the past for now. The rooms while laid out differently are still extremely clean and functional. Soundproofing between rooms could be better but it is still a great option to stay and play!
50,First time there everything was perfect. Staff helped with anything questions or concerns I had. Room and hotel was very clean. Mobile check in was super easy. Shower has amazing water pressure super modern. I will definitely stay there again.
50,Very clean and updated a bit smaller then expected but perfect for a couple. Staff and employees were great the would come and clean the room as soon as you were out witch is GREAT!! Over all stay was amazing!!
30,Finally getting back to normal. We decided Vegas was in order. I had a fabulous trip. Hotel could be a little better. Bed was extremely comfortable hallway and elevator areas never cleaned while there. Casino had great staff. Need more coffee places!
50,I am so pleased to have a non smoking option in Las Vegas. I enjoy gambling but not the smoke. This was our first stay here and the rooms were nice clean and modern. The pools were clean and lounge chairs comfortable. The location was perfect by the Hershey store. It is also convenient to Target CVS Walgreens and other shopping.
40,My daughter’s cheer competition brought us to Las Vegas. I chose the Park MGM because of the reasonable rates and the smoke free hotel and casino. The room was nice beds were very comfortable and our bathroom had a shower only but it was amazing. Decor was a bit dated but nothing awful.  The lack of options to dine/eat was a letdown. Not a huge deal as we could walk to other restaurants.  If you come to Las Vegas with your kids the atmosphere is definitely low key and you can cross the street to New York New York for family entertainment.
10,It took us 45 minutes to park and then we ended up having to park in the Aria- and walk our luggage across the street in the middle of the crowd. Then the room's windows were super thin and we could hear everything outside the window. The taxi service is a no go- because the police shut off the street when the Knight's games get out-- so you have to go to NYNY (which no one told us they were just letting us all stand in line). Lastly we had to wait 20 minutes for an elevator just to get out of the hotel because half of their elevators were shut down. Very disappointed in this hotel.
10,We where there for a mothers day get away our first day room is not that clean towel is oldroom is too smallWe woke up early morning because the noise from the room next to us was so noisythey have bad sound proofingthe next day we had a problem again because there was an event going on accross the street and we can hear it from our roomit was really loud.staff is not that friendly.
50,The whole hotel and casino is smoke free and being able to breathe clean air is so welcoming! There are 3 pools so always somewhere to sit in the sun or shade! We had a fun girls weekend but would be a great place for families too! Great location close to everything so you don't need a car!
50,I had a really nice day there everyone from the concierge to the maître d’ were very nice thank you so very much for accommodating us and upgrading our room as a courtesy. The overall value of the room and stay was well worth the money that we paid there definitely needs to be a bit more staff for the restaurants as they were overworked and the wait times for coffee and pastries was really long but again still all very worth it
50,Took a blast from the past. How many words equal 100. I don’t k kw. But it was a good time here in the Park    Love and will be in touch next time we arrive in Vegas for a super party many’s haha    You know how to do it right boo
50,What a relief! A smoke free resort and casino on the Las Vegas Strip. I am hopefully the other resorts and casinos will realize what a excellent business model this is. Fresh new and clean are good ways to describe the Park MGM .
50,This was our first time staying at Park MGM and I would definitely stay here again. The rooms are very spacious the overall aesthetic of the hotel both inside and outside is beautiful the pools are gorgeous with lots of chairs available and it's a non-smoking casino! The only negatives I found were the door to the closet and bathroom is a shared barn door making it a bit cumbersome to get ready and the small dresser and hanging space in the closet. Overall I would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to stay here.
40,I stayed at this hotel for three nights and i have not encountered any problem frim check in to check out. The location is perfect walking distance to everything. No smoking inside the hotel which is great for my family and me because we have astma. Thanks to the staff everyone was great.
50,I was very impressed with what Park MGM overall apperance etc. I wish more of they restaurants were open etc. But overall I was very impressive with they cleanliness of they public restrooms they hotel lobby and they elevators security u need your key to get to your floor etc.
40,Not to bad over all they have worked hard to update this place and it shows great location awesome staff the only thing was that how low the bed was to the ground being a taller guy it was a pretty good drop. The non smoking is an added bonus as well!!!
50,Park MGM is completely smoke free. For anyone tired of people sitting at a machine next to them dealing with another person blowing smoke in your face this is the casino for you. Very clean facility. Due to Covid several restaurants in the food court were closed but we still had food options including great room service food. Front desk handled a noise complaint for us very professionally and made us feel like we were the important guest and not the complaining guest.
40,The hotel is located in a very neutral location close to shopping and restaurants. The hotel is non smoking while I loved very clean and staff was friendly and courteous. The rooms are modern (basic) but spacious. I liked the color theme ours was red! It’s worth the try and money not too crowded like others which was a major plus.
50,This was my first stay at this property but have been visiting Las Vegas for the last 12 years. I LOVED that it is a totally non-smoking property. I found so may good food options within a few minutes walk next door in NYNY (avoid the strip by using the side entrance through the Park into NYNY. And I found that there is a connecting hallway into the Aria. Nice food at Primrose and we loved Best Friend. This pool was really nice because there were always chairs available. Unlike some we didn’t have to go at opening to be able to sit!!
50,Surrounded be great food pools and shops! Enjoyed our stay and the surrounding shopping at the Aria. I will be back. Our room was a little small but it had everything we needed. I will be back enjoyed every movement
50,We had a very pleasant experience at Park MGM. The amenities were convenient and plentiful and everyone there was friendly and helpful. It’s convenient to other casinos on the strip and non smoking atmosphere was a nice touch as well.
50,Couldn't have asked for a better Las Vegas experience.  Staff at Park MGM super nice and helpful.  Smoke free casino what a relief. Food court yummy. Looking forward to my next stay here. I highley recommend this for your next visit.
40,Yeah I didn't really come to Vegas to watch tv but it would have been nice for things to work during the 30 minutes I am in my room awake. I did call the front desk once and it wasn't fixed seemed silly to call again. Annoying to know a friend could airplay to TV in Nomad but I couldn't in MGM Park
40,Middle of everything food in the casino is minimal but there’s plenty of places all around. Room was great and free parking I hope they always keep free parking if that’s the case I’ll for sure stay here more often
40,We stayed in a Nighthawk suite on the 23rd floor suite 102. The room was immaculately clean our view looked over the pools also allowing a close up view of the Aria and Vegas strip. Our only complaint is that the mechanical noise vibrations in the room while trying to sleep made our stay less than hoped for in that regard. The prices for food drink in the property seemed very high to us but I imagine that is the norm on the Vegas strip these days. The staff was friendly and helpful although seemingly under-staffed due to sudden increased volume of guests as the pandemic eases it's grip. We had a wonderful dinner at La Pizza e La Pasta and loved it again except for the price. We enjoyed the pastries and coffee in the morning in Eataly. An enjoyable getaway for us. Non-smoking was a big draw for us and very welcome.  We will be back and we will bring more cash!
20,"The title of this review is ""How to ruin a beautiful hotel with only $550 million.” Let me preface this critique by saying that we live in Vegas. We are also card-carrying MLife members loyal fans of the brand. So when staycation time rolled around again as it does 2-3 times a year (and we live where you vacation so we rarely venture out beyond 15 miles away) we decided to go wild and break from our never-fails norm at MGM Grand and try the Park MGM. Let me tell you in the late 90's I was of the opinion that the Monte Carlo was the nicest classiest cleanest prettiest most ""marbly"" hotel on the strip...with great shops & restaurants a beautiful pool area and exquisite huge rooms with awe-inspiringly spacious tubs AND separate showers! So if the Park as we'd read was an improvement then by golly let's go! Ummm--No. Let me rephrase that-- OMG no! In a word hideous. Starting with the pea-soup green exterior to the dwarfing of what used to be one of the most breathtaking lobbies on the strip to the stark minimalist absence of all things aesthetic to the room itself--barf. Reminded me of some one room apartment in Boston. No fridge no coffeemaker no desk!! The decor is industrialist French if that makes any sense at all red sofa to match red walls a confusing array of small mismatched photos everywhere that aren’t aesthetically pleasing much less “art” light fixtures with exposed power cords and a wanna-be Murphy bed so low to the floor you practically have to roll out of it. (Not a 60-yr old woman's idea of a good time!). The red-tile shower is pretty but obviously a man designed it because there's no place to prop up your foot to shave your legs (I guess women don't do that anymore?) Anyway I could go on and on--even more than I already have. I will never return here it broke my heart to think of all the beauty that was torn out and destroyed to make this high-rise Super-8. Back to the MGM Grand we go even tho I'm pretty mad at them for ruining my wonderful memories of the exquisite former hotel. Don't stay here."
50,Now that ParkMGM is non smoking I won't even consider another casino. The pools are wonderful the staff is great the food is delicious the rooms are clean. I can't think of a reason that someone would choose another resort.
50,For starters the no smoking in the casino was great! Glad to see a casino who caters to customers who don't smoke! The staff was very friendly from top to bottom room was very clean. Thanks to everyone who made our trip amazing we can't wait to come back!
40,Easy access nice rooms quick check in conveniently located on the strip short trip to airport non smoking casino good job in casino as providing safe space to gamble food and drinks were excellent.
40,We have been here before this was our first time back during covid and we loved the new no smoking policy. We wished all the bars and restaurants were open but overall we were happy with all aspects of the hotel casino.
50,This place is great! (Used to be the Monte Carlo easy access to Aria and Bellagio btw) It’s so nice to stay and gamble at a place without inhaling smoke everywhere! Clean great value great location well appointed and the water pressure is amazing! The only “complaint” I’d say is that there’s no fridge or microwave in the room which is a problem when you go out to breakfast or dinner and have leftovers. Would definitely stay here again!
30,Had a decent stay recently at the Park MGM. I like the fact the entire property is smoke free which was noticeable compared to walking through casinos like the Bellagio where it seems like everyone is smoking. The rooms were ok but seemed sort of worn down and small but was definitely comfortable. Decent place to stay on a budget.
50,Always like the Monte Carlo now that it is the Park MGM and it is Smoke-free we like it even more. Eataly is great and the smaller size of the Casino just makes for a very pleasant stay. Rooms are clean and common spaces are comfortable.
10,Our check in was great with the front desk and bell desk. Unfortunately the pool staff some of the concierge staff and management was extremely unwelcoming seemed to be bothered to answer questions. Our server at the pool during our stay in the cabana was not friendly at all. We have stayed here several times and had never experienced such horrible treatment.
40,Rooms are great people are great. Close to everything. Beds are like sleeping on plywood very hard. If it wasn’t for the beds i would give it a five star rating. The food is awesome had a great weekend just to get away.
10,Highly recommend you DO NOT stay here the check in process did not work unable to reach an operator rooms and facility disgusting dirty outdated beds terrible and Most things in the room were broke and not clean
40,Just stayed for one night but we will be back. Though small the room was clean comfortable and well appointed. Only drawback was the lack of a refrigerator and coffee maker. The casino was likewise clean and well spaced though somewhat small. The entire complex is smoke-free which is a huge plus.
50,This will be my go to every trip now! I love that the entire property is non smoking. The rooms are beautiful and so is the entire property. And the staff was exceptional. And Eataly was amazing! So many delicious choices! You HAVE to get a cannoli!!
50,This was my families first time ever in Las Vegas and we were beyond happy with the location of the MGM Park and how beautiful the hotel was and the beds were so comfy! The hotel is non smoking and we liked that especially in the Casino area. Staff was wonderful and we couldn't have asked for a better first time experience just wish we could have stayed longer ;)
20,We checked in on May 1st the day Vegas was supposed to be 80% open but I think the 20% that was closed was all at the Park. It felt like nothing was open! Shops... closed. Restaurants... closed (especially after 10pm). Bars... there aren't many. and the only have one bar tender working so service was more miss than hit. The Casino had no action... no excitement. And the rooms have NO FRIDGES. They want you in their restaurants and bars... but they are all closed. Hard to have a room party with no fridge... or eat left overs.    There was some good though. The bell staff and check-in/front desk staff were awesome as were the pool staff. The day at the pool was the best part of our experience at Park even if the pools are kinda plain compared to other properties.
40,The park mgm is a nice clean and pretty hotel. The bed was super comfy and great shower. Not near enough storage and lacking amenities in the room. Very good price and if you want a clean very simple room this place is for you.
50,The location of the hotel is midway through the Strip. Easy processes to check-in & out. Safe and secure as well as friendly staff. Fun eatery options and easy pickup at designated Uber location. Enjoyed the non-smoking feature as well and the closeness to convenient amenities such as a 24hr CVS and Walgreens next door.
40,I really do not like getting “comped” a room and still having to pay $40 resort fee. I don’t swim I don’t do anything but gamble. I give you plenty of money gambling. Getting comped a room should be free and not sneak in a resort fee that I don’t use.
30,Need some more convenience items like ALL OTHER HOTELS... refrigerator and microwave... more clothing drawers... desk pen and paper... then the silly things like “naming this review”? Its your review I'm filling in the blanks...you name it... lol... and then make me write 200+ characters... so now you got a mouth full...pretty dumb whoever designed this...
40,Rooms and hotel overall was clean. Simple inexpensive rooms that are much better than Luxor Excalibur and MGM (ww).    Won a $1400 jackpot (betting $2.50). Most of the machines I played on seemed looser than other places on the strip.. $900 here (betting $5) $300 there (betting $2.50) $400 there (betting $2.50).    Friendly housekeeping front desk casino staff and Eataly bartenders.    Make sure to book reservations for pool and restaurants. Capacity is higher starting May 1st so it shouldn’t be too much of a problem but have a plan.    Note this hotel does require a key to go up to your floor so if you have a group make sure to plan on being on the same floor.
50,Didn't have to worry about anything. They had me covered for all the reservations that I wanted. Easy to get uber or lyft to every destination that I had planned. Would go again if I had the time to go.
50,Everything was wonderful I love the fact that you can do all your check in on the app and you never have to stand in line to check in . I love the location it walking distance to Everything food & shopping
50,I am currently pregnant and the atmosphere was perfect! Non smoking and the food downstairs is amazing. We were able to walk to the aria to pick up some Asian food and saw a HUGE difference of atmosphere. Park mgm is calmer cleaner and more laid back!
20,Leaky shower seal Broken water all over bathroom our floor safe did not work room cleanliness was average and remote control didn’t work manager was unconcerned when we called and what really was the worst was they new it had issues for prior hotel guest and still have us the room.
40,I haven't stayed here since it was the Monte Carlo. Hotel and Casino were nice and very clean. We had King bed room. The room wasn't exceptionally large but it had a nice bathroom linens bath towels. Small table and chair and couch. It was $49 with tax for a night so very inexpensive on the strip. Check in was easy. All of the staff were very friendly and professional.
40,The staff was very nice. Check in was a breeze. I recommend getting an actual key card not the digital key. Beds were comfortable nice pillows. The room could use some updates but the bathroom was nice. Overall would stay there again.
40,We will definitely stay at the Park MGM again! The location is perfect for those wanting to walk the strip play casino games or just relax in the modernesque room.    Super easy access to other casinos too! Loved the non-smoking environment and the free parking!
30,Park MGM is in a great location close to the T Mobile Arena but. The room that we had was a little bit bigger than a king size bed. One very small closet and a small bathroom. The room itself was decorated nicely but the bed did not have a box spring underneath so the bed was very low to the ground soft and comfy but too low.  We stayed two nights and tried to explore Eataly on the other side of the Casino but only two of the attractions were open for business at 3pm in the afternoon. Even after a Hockey game you would think that they would be open for dining but no. Disappointing at best.  As Las Vegas opens up maybe it’ll open up more but for now it was just okay. If I were to stay again I would try to upgrade to a bigger room.
50,This hotel is within walking distance to most major attraction. A very nice smoke free hotel. The elevators were fast as it is always readily available. The food at Eataly was great especially the pizza and gelato.
50,Great being right by the arena. Catch a Vegar Knights game if you can. Grab a bite at Eatily Bavettes is nowhere as good as the old steak house. So dark inside you cant even read the menu. Thats about the only draw back.
40,Had a great time. Had alot of fun no smoking was the best part. Gambling there was nice won a little money. It was busy but good. Had no problem at all. The sports bar had ok food. The waitresses were great with giving out drinks
50,Visited for a long weekend for my birthday. Had a great time. The location of the Park MGM formerly The Montecarlo is spot on. Right in the middle of everything. But if you don’t want to leave the resort that works too. The Park MGM has everything you need on property. All new and fresh.
30,Gave us an occupied room and by the time we received a new room our early check-in was pointless. No microwave or fridge in the room. Gambling service was non-existent. Long walk to anything. Was clean because it is new.
50,Had an amazing weekend with my close friends. We just wanted a peaceful relaxing trip and that's exactly what we got. Park mgm is great the staff is super friendly and attentive. I will be back 100%..
10,The room keys never works  The staff didn’t help nor cared  I can hear the next room partying till 3am  Also requested tooth brush and towels and it never came    I was promised a comp and it ddidnt work at
50,This property is one of the best on the strip. Location was amazing it was so easy to get around to all the different attraction. Also the taxi drivers was very friendly. I had issues with Lyft but other than that Park MGM was the best!!
20,Great location on the strip! Best part - Uber/Lyft pick-up and drop-off is at the back of the property. This means you can avoid all the traffic/pedestrians on the strip. Outside of that this property fell short on execution. Park MGM is the old Monte Carlo. All the did was paint an accent wall in the rooms and hand (very) random artwork. But to be fair - I REALLY appreciate the entire resort is smoke free. This noticeable when you leave the property and venture into other resorts... just nasty. And leaving Park MGM is necessary - they have no entertainment onsite.
50,Highly recommend for any getaway  Smoke free environment only enriches your time in the facility  Great location to amenities and the Vegas strip. Easy access to monorail at MGM and easy access to New York New York
40,Really the only downside was the location on the strip but there's nothing that can be done about that. It's too close to tourist and liquor store type surroundings for my taste but otherwise the value outshined it all.
40,For the first time in many stays at Park MGM we experienced a subpar form of cleanliness. The overall quality of the Las Vegas Strip as diminished over the last 18 months and this makes us have second thoughts when visiting again.
50,Hotel was exceptional!Staff was very friendly parking garage was close overall the hotel was very clean and family oriented.Plan on bringing my family in a few months the only downfall was the wait time for the pool and the cabana rentals were a bit pricey overall I would give this five stars
30,Overall it was a nice stay on the strip with plenty available if you don’t want to travel too far from your room. The tram to the Bellagio was not in service but would be great in the future. The room itself was fairly basic the bathroom had a sliding door without any locks in case you plan on staying with others. The shower was powerful but the design made it easy to spray water everywhere since you have to start on the cold before turning it over to hot. We got a great view of the NyNy and T-mobile arena (prettier than the strip side in my opinion). Check in was lengthy as there are only a few front desk associates at one time. They offer two kiosks for self check in but those get backed up quickly too. Restaurants closed pretty early (mostly around 10pm) and room service is limited as well. The room did not include a fridge or café buffet of any sort so plan accordingly as much of this was not in the original description and given a two night stay was approx. 720 USD Fri/Sat we had hoped for a little more. Overall it was an ok stay and made for a quiet weekend. Room has great blackout curtains and the room was very quiet.
50,Great location on the strip smoke free hotel large rooms and amazing dining options! MLife rewards provided an awesome promotion that made it difficult to resist. Would definitely stay here again!!!
50,Park MGM is doing all it must and more to shake off people that had a less than great experience at the old Monte Carlo. This property has all you need and most of what you want in Vegas. Newly redecorated rooms are fantastic. Bevette's is one of the best places for steak in Vegas. Great pool Also located about as good as you can get to get around the rest of the Strip. Great casino.
50,Absolutely outstanding hotel perfectly located. Helpful friendly staff who go above and beyond to make sure you have the best time in Las Vegas Will be back with friends and I would highly recommend this hotel.
30,Walls are paper thin so no sleep with neighbors talking in normal tone. Rooms very tight and all red. Red walls red sofa and even red tile in shower. Great location for T Mobile arena long as sleep isn’t a priority!
30,The property is clean and up to date. You can hear every sound in the room next to you. So if you are a light sleeper bring ear plugs. Not many food options aside from Italian on-site. The casino is small compared to other properties. Don't know if access to pool and fitness center is worth extra $40 a day but you pay for it anyway.
50,My last stay at the Park MGM I received a free room upgrade with a strip view. My family and I had very great pool side service and easy checkin.The smoke free casino is really nice as well and not cluttered.
30,The best thing about this property is the smoke free casino. With Marijuana being legal there you are constantly around someone smoking it especially in the hotel rooms. But with this property being smoke free no issue with that at all! If the rooms weren't quite so dated we would definitely stay there again. The hallway to get to our room was dark and dingy. As soon as I saw that I thought we are in trouble!! The room was clean the shower was awesome but in Vegas it's about glitz and glam. The room was so far from that. It took the special feeing right out of it!
10,The service is ok but the room needs to be clean he had a room that has a very strong smell of a guy’s cologne. Restaurant closes early and some of the days they are close. Italian food is ok but very pricey for a food court.
40,Great Location Hallways are very dark and lighting in the hallways poor. They need to update the décor we had to use our flashlight on our phone to find something that was dropped ! Trams were not working due to covid which was one of the reasons we choose the hotel for convenience. Looking forward to a new update which is much needed.
40,Stayed at the park MGM for a business trip in April 2021. The only problem I had was the online check-in experience the app didn’t seem to work so I had to stand in line and check in food options were excellent. Eataly a great draw being on site. Looking forward to some new restaurants opening in the future.
50,We were greeted with such professional staff throughout our stay. Any questions we may have had were quickly and professionally answered. Each section had extra mask if you may have forgotten yours in your room. You would see the work being performed as to keeping this place clean and sanitized for Covid-19.
50,Great location rooms are spacious and clean. Fast room service. Fluffy pillows!!! Loved it!!! I use my vegas app game and only paid resort fee. Parking is free too. Non smoking hotel smells and feels great for me!!!
50,The first non-smoking casino/resort on the strip is worth a visit. The air is cleaner the quality is higher and the vibe is fun at this modernized resort. It has all the games you could want though it’s maybe lacking cheaper table games. The rooms are comfortable (though the power of the air leaves a bit to be desired it does eventually get to the temp you’re looking for) and the showers are probably the strongest I’ve ever seen in a hotel. Would be nice if they upped their food game. Fortunately they’re super close to other food options but they essentially only have sit-down restaurants (plus Eataly) and everything is closed by 10pm. Also room service stops at 2pm on weekdays which is disappointing for a city that is quite literally up all night.
30,The property is in a great location. It’s just not Aria. During Covid there isn’t much open and that was the same for table games. It would have been easier if the whole casino was just closed and they sent us to Aria instead of pretending that they are operating a casino
50,First time on this property I vibe and love the atmosphere here the most compared to all the other places. Im the classy type who likes to go to Eataly and high class restaurants and hangout all day instead of partying and walking the strip or being in crowds. This place is the bees knees. I jist need to bring my pet next time.
30,The hotel is beautiful well kept. The pool and gym are great. We did not have any food there. Down fall the digital key DOES NOT WORK. Starbucks never seemed to be open which was a bummer when your a coffee drinker. The room is small and nice but you can hear everything your neighbors are doing. Thank god it was a casual conversation we had to listen too.
50,We typically stay in Las Vegas several times a year. Our go-to strip property has always been the Mirage. Because things are different right now we decided to try something new. We selected the Park mainly for pool non-smoking property and food choices (Eataly etc.). Concerns about review digs about noise and dim hallways did not materialize. The room was comfortable and roomy with a couch chair and large table. Excellent shower. Nice casino and Eataly is awesome. We also enjoyed other nearby restaurants including Tom’s Urban Crack Shack and Nine Fine Irishman... all highly recommended. The pool scene was spot on... not to rowdy not to sleepy. And pool servers Rue and Jessica who cared for us were both friendly and exceptionally efficient. Kudos to you two! The property takes COVID precautions seriously without being overbearing. Overall no complaints and we will be back. My only complaint and perhaps this applies everywhere is that casinos have such ridiculously high table limits it’s almost comical watching table dealers standing idle without customers because no one wants to play at those levels. consider lowering the limits put your staff to work let us play and make some money? This is the constant and valid complaint you hear among visitors.
10,Staying here currently too annoyed to wait to write a review till I’ve checked out.    It’s $200 a night. they charge $40 every day for a ‘resort fee’ I would give 1 star just for that. They list the fee as including WiFi (which I’m pretty sure is illegal under the internet tax freedom act) the fact they have a gym and then it literally says “printing of your boarding pass” ???    Besides the resort fee being ridiculous (especially during covid) here’s a list of things that seemed insane considering the cost-    -No room service past 2pm on weekdays  -$9 room service delivery fee not listed on the menu or anywhere before ordering  -No duvet cover only 2 top sheets wrapped around a comforter  -no bathrobes  -no mini bar  -no tea or coffee in room  - very difficult to get ahold of front desk  Then nothings open down stairs either because it’s a weekday or covid either way paying for a resort fee feels insane    On a separate note you have to pay to reserve seating by the pool. I checked a reclining chair that was literally $100 for one day on the weekend.
40,Nice quiet hotel. The room was not clean when we first checked in but they did come to clean it soon.  Not as fancy or busy with amenities and restaurants as some other hotels on the strip. The hotel however is in a great location the staff was very friendly and the price was reasonable.
40,The Park MGM is located in a convenient area on the strip. Having a non-smoking casino is certainly a plus. The rooms were very clean; however there were no drawers to put clothing just a mirrored closet with shelves. There were days which it got warm and there was no way to turn on the air conditioning so we did not sleep the best.
40,We had a great stay. Staff was friendly... Digital Check In was AWESOME!!! We arrived at 2:00 am and went straight to our room... Only wished our AC was colder and cheaper prices in  Lobby stores..Two m&m's and two bottles of Gatorade and one water was $24.00 😳 Good Lawd🤦Cleaning Crew was The BEST!! They kept our room clean and very very friendly...I will stay again
50,Made our first trip to Vegas and chose the Park MGM due to its awesome location. The room was super clean the hotel and staff was super awesome the casino took some of our money but not all...lol. It will be even better when everything else opens up! We will stay here or the Nomad on our next trip without a doubt.
40,Was surprised to see that the hotel was non-smoking. This is a plus to people that enjoy a non smoking environment… but I like to have a few brews and smokes when I gamble. Had to go next door until it was time to go to sleep.
50,Great non smoking casino centrally located on the strip with clean rooms with a great decor. Would recommend for families and large groups the staff was very accommodating to special requests to make the stay more pleasant
30,We stayed at the Park MGM for one night. It was very simple to check in good clean room and average and nice stay. casino has very affordable minimums and we loved the restaurants in the casino including Best Friend. Overall good stay!
30,I do. It feel like explaining something that will not make a difference same thing over and over again please I do not feel like explaining myself over and over again and again over and over again over and over again
40,We were anxious to experience a smoke free hotel/casino it was well worth the time great not having the stale smoke smell all around. The hotel is very nice rooms well appointed. The casino is small with a limited variety of table games blackjack three card poker and one ultimate holdem They also have a faceup Pai Gow game. Casino is spacious and cashier MLife rewards centrally located. All the staff were great very friendly and helpful.    If you are a casual gambler this is a great place to play.    One issue at checkin we got assigned to an occupied room. Had to lug everything back to desk to get a new room assigned.
50,This was a great hotel to stay at. It was extremely clean and we were able to sleep in after a late night on the strip. Best friend was amazing as well as the pizza stand (the sit down pizza was not so great). The pastries in the front entrance were also unbelievable!
40,Non Smoking gem. Great location and lots of restaurants close to chose from. Friendly staff. The rooms could be cleaner. We stay here every year because of location and value. I highly recommend this hotel
10,Room smelled bad. Loud AC heard neighbor showering every time very loudly. Water running thru sewer pipes. Super old everything. 3star at best. Very dark hallway 8ft ceiling. Gym was ok. Casual restaurants up front were good
30,It is a decent hotel for the price but was not happy with that part of the strip. Not many restaurants or stores for snacks. No refrigerator in the room which made it difficult to buy water for daily activities. Had to spend $3 on drinks from vending machines but half the time they did not have the drink we would want and if we went down stairs the same soda would have been $5.
20,"If you want to sleep in your room I'd recommend staying elsewhere. You can hear literally everything from the rooms. From the incredible loud neighbors to the large wedding party playing football and screaming till 4 am in the floors lobby it was truly an awful experience. Used panties were left in the room and we're never cleaned on any subsequent days despite mentioning this to them. The decor and design of the rooms are pretty ugly. Why would you spend so much money to update a hotel in a vintage style but where it looks like you're staying in your grandparents room that slapped some ""trendy"" red accents throughout.  The casino and facility is otherwise nice although the casino is pretty small."
10,Formerly the Monte Carlo the Park MGM has been refurbished but it's still a sub-par property. The rooms are small and very cheaply furnished and lit. The hallways to the rooms are dimly lit and depressing. The only advantage was the presence of Eataly in the front of the hotel. MGM resorts has many other better properties (although of course more expensive). Don't bother with this one.
10,Disastrous and disappointed. First off Vegas is suppose to be a place to let go and leave everything behind and I couldn’t find either of those feelings while here. I was ecstatic for our stay and it all started to fall apart first night when the ac wasn’t blowing cold so the tech came up to take a look. He said he was going to change the filter. He took it out and it was absolutely covered in thick layers of dust and lint. Especially in times like this of living during a pandemic with an airborne virus you would expect this to get done more often than the norm... not the case. Thankfully that fixed the ac not blowing correctly but it wasn’t the end of the problems The next morning my gf woke up with bumps on all over her arm. We spoke with the manager and best he could do was get us out of the hotel completely with a refund... I asked if I could even pay to upgrade and nothing... He said I could go look for for somewhere else to stay or we could stay in the same room. Being that I had already been drinking moving to find another place to stay was not going to be an option... I spoke with the manager again and ended up having to stay so we asked him to flip the room and have it fully serviced and sanitized again. We went up to the room to pull all the sheets off to make sure it would get cleaned and found this giant stain on the corner of the bed... Disgusting is the only word I can use to describe this stay... They won’t be getting my business again...
50,I had an offer through my mgm account so I paid basically taxes + resort fee. Roughly 50$ a night. And for that price it’s a 5 star review. You can’t do better than that. I went in with expectations for a Vegas low tier hotel. It had a clean and comfortable bed. The shows got hot. And I slept fantastic. I spent probably only midnight - 8 am in the room each day so nothing else really matters.    I do love the location. Great food in Eataly and the casino is SMOKE FREE. Which I would pay a lot for.    Room was clean bed comfy. Ac worked and shower hot. For 50$ a night. Win.
50,Hotel is always clean staff are always friendly. Love the food choices they have inside. Lounges have good drink selections. Also love that it’s a smoke free casino. Location is also great. I Always come back to stay here!
10,"Hotel lobby and casino are nice BUT the hotel rooms are dark thin walls and pungent smell of dog feces. Had to call housekeeping to change sheets due to ""questionable"" stains and the new sheets weren't that much better. You can hear everything in the halls next room as well as bathroom next and above. Calling the front desk: no answer and going down the line was long. We got a noise complain for laughing in our room at 11:30 pm...in Vegas!"
50,This location is the best. Easy access to other places. They also have amazing restaurants and bars. Their pool area its also great. We loved it as well because we did not used our car at all. I need to be back!
10,Pools haven’t been updated. Rooms felt slimy and icky. If you’d like to hear your neighbors conversations stay here. Really. I had hopes for this place. Food is over priced and rooms look undermaintained.
30,Air conditioner was poor. Hotel.was clean. Prices were very high. No place to eat breakfast except Starbucks and eately. No place to eat a full breakfast. Need at least one budget fast food place to grab a quick inexpensive snack or small meal.
50,From the beginning it was a warm greeting from the staff. Nice that it's smoking free and happy atmosphere. Only downfall was hoping the walls were more noise proof but not a huge deal since one we put music and/or the TV.
10,We were given a room that was very dirty there was blankets thrown all over the place and beds were not made. The restrooms had dirty towels thrown on the floor. The next room they gave us after that had a flooded shower and we were promised that it would be fixed and it was not fixed until 24 hours later
50,It was our first time staying here and we loved it. We loved the location above all and the smoke free casino is also a big plus. Our suite was also very spacious and the clean. The brunch spot called primrose had amazing pancakes.
50,we booked it for our wedding getaway and it was perfect location to stay totally recommend it.  had a great time beds are comfy pool was great is temperature regulated even for April weather; will book again.
50,Park MGM is a medium size Hotel/Casino located in the center of the Las Vegas Strip. The non-smoking environment is great. All employees are courteous and friendly. The restaurants are excellent and the swimming pools are clean and comfortable.
40,My husband and I stayed at this hotel for one night. The hotel itself is very beautiful and well maintained we did not need to check in at front desk since we have ourselves mlife accounts so we could do our own check in and got into our room with digital keys. Once we got to the room it was just very small and simple. The carpet was very worn out and had huge stains...one at the entrance by the bathroom and another one by the bed. We both think this was an okay room nothing special. Also we could not see much thru the window since it was extremely dirty... besides that everything else was perfect! we barely spent time in the room so that was okay for us.
50,My friends and I enjoyed this hotel and all its property immensely. The no-smoking policy was an easy decision for us when booking we were able to secure an upgrade to a suite thanks to a duo of wonderful front desk girls and the overall ambience of the hotel is pleasing and induces no stress whatsoever. Highly recommend for a future stay in Vegas I will definitely be back!
10,Disappointed from Start to Finish - We were idling in Valet line for quite some time before we were notified to 'Go Park in the Self Park Tower'. Parking was a disaster. Structure and elevator experience was disgusting. Additionally there were green lights that were illuminated above what we found to be already occupied stalls. Unfortunately even worse was the Hotel Floor Experience. I was embarrassed to have referred family to this hotel. The hotel floor was unappealing with very low ceilings in corridors. Room was poorly appointed dark and dismal green. This was supposedly a recently refreshed property... Adding to the unfortunate experiences the clientele was unruly obnoxious disrespectful and some were smoking pot at various locations in and outside of the Park MGM. Couldn't wait to leave. We will NEVER stay at the Park MGM again.
50,The ParkMGM has hit the nail on the head with a non smoking property. The rooms were great and centrally located. Eatly the Italian high end food court was top notch. Never has a place been so inviting than stepping on the property and not inhaling a Cochella concert to gamble.
50,Cozy comfortable friendly service. Check-in process was the best. Parking was exceptional especially since it was free. Great to have the green and red lights to direct you to open spaces. Casino was clean and staff was great
50,Resort staff was great. Resort was great. Eataly was phenomenal. The room renovation is exceptional and room was extremely clean. Bell staff was friendly and very prompt delivering our luggage. Front Desk staff streamlined the checkin experience.
50,Very well situated on the strip. We chose this resort because even the casino was non-smoking. Check in/out was mobile and super easy. Our room was mostly comped with MLife points-definitely worth signing up. Our only negative was the carpet was smelly and old. It had a very moldy smell to it.
20,Stayed here in the past & really enjoyed it. Sadly not impressed this time. Wish I'd stayed at one of the many other resorts I receive offers from. Lots of issues food was terrible & overpriced restaurants had such limited hours & often closed so it was difficult to ever find anywhere to eat not impressed with the menus either lots of issues trying to check in several people screaming in hallways/their room - ( I understand this is Vegas but this was another level & the things being yelled were very concerning/scary) extremely tight slot machines spent more money than ever before & it was hard to even hit a small bonus room starting to look a little run down barely any pressure/water for shower placed us at the very end of hall which was an extremely long walk every time (we do a ton of walking in vegas & this just made it worse especially if needing to go back to grab something real quick..) to add to that we had no view check out line was long and horrible - people getting angry waiting & almost started fighting lines need to be better marked for priority or they need the VIP section open - at least during checkout/in time someone tried to get in room while we were in there sometimes a long wait for elevator - it's like they placed everyone in the same hotel section as this was the only elevator with this issue got food from primrose - awful & did not taste fresh at all beerhaus hot dog was pretty awful fries were good but cold (however we got excellent service from the girl at the bar.. she was extremely sweet & always made sure our drinks were filled!) etc. I do appreciate that this resort is non-smoking & that was a huge reason we chose to stay here. I wish more hotels would follow suit. This was our first time back to Vegas in a long time so this experience was very disappointing when we had the option of staying at many other resorts.
10,Never expect that they will keep their word. Unfriendly staff. Unfriendly bar. Unfriendly hotel staff mlife rewards is a rip off. They take advantage of you. Don't care unless you drop a bundle gambling.
10,I had a terrible experience at Park MGM for the following reasons: Cleanliness expensive price for little value terrible food options. First the room was filthy dirty windows; no housekeeping services until my third day when I complained to the front desk and then someone showed up late in the day. Food available at those venues that were open (not everything was open) was over/under-cooked. Bad food is one thing but overpriced bad food is a whole different level of outrage. Pizza at the sit down restaurant at Eataly was harder than a hockey puck. I had a sandwich at another food stall and the meat was undercooked. I can't believe the health department allows their food court to be open. The food was not worth the spit it was cooked in. Their MLife program is a joke. I tried to rent a car through Avis using the MLife membership I had and Avis refused to honor it. You're better off at a homeless shelter.
50,Super nice hotel that's in great location. The casino is very big and clean. The staff were nice and helpful. I will for sure will be returning to this hotel. I really enjoy my stay here. They experience was great formy first time in vegas
10,Too Old School needs to modernize their beddings technology and bathrooms. Uncomfortable sleep also need to rearrange the TV to a better watching position also need to dim their lighting on the MGM Park billboard kept waking me up everynight.
50,We enjoyed our time at the Park MGM a lot. Casino was tight but you can expect that since they have to make money somehow with the low attendance. I would recommend this facility to everyone. Nice staff and very clean.
50,I decided to travel and park MGM was suggested. The room was comfortable and well lit. Staff was excellent from check in to checkout. Always ready to go beyond the norm. Will definitely be back soon .
40,The staff are all amazingly friendly and helpful (or at least the staff that helped me). The room felt clean and comforting.  There are a lack of amenities for the entry level rooms (no bath no snack bar no mini fridge).
30,Long lines and fighting on my floor . Front desk wasn’t hearing or helping with the problems I had. Housekeeping forgot to leave clean towels one morning the worst part was they made the beds but didn’t clean the bathroom
50,We had a great experience at this location. From check in to check out staff was super friendly and attentive. Room was clean and spacious and the location was great. If I had to give some constructive feedback it would be the bed was a bit too firm for my liking but thats just me. Overall very happy with our stay!
40,We enjoyed the hotel. The rooms were comfortable casino area was great. good selection of restaurants.  They have done a great job in remodeling the hotel.  we will definitely return in the future for a good time
50,Did not stay at the hotel so can’t comment on that. I will say I used to avoid this resort but haven’t been since 2019. This is a new place. Extremely clean and smells great newly remodeled everything great selection of games (with routine $10 blackjack) and most of all very friendly staff. Having Eatily on site is a great perk. We’re now considering staying here on our next stay. (Didn’t hurt I was up a good amount of scratch here). Hopefully mgm grand gets an update of this caliber soon!
40,We enjoyed staying at this Park MGM. It’s nice and clean and smoke-free which is why it was chosen. The only downsides is that the room walls are thin (we could hear our neighbors) and the plugs next to the bed didn’t work.
50,Park MGM is low-key hospitality comfortable geared to be your place of respite during very active ventures onto the LV Strip. Mobile check-in and room entry are fabulous self-parking really convenient eating venues great and varied.
50,A non smoking casino and hotel. Fun bars great food multiple pools and a decent night life atmosphere. Their food area is mostly Italian but it sure was delicious. Rooms are nothing special but definitely better and comfy since the remodel.
50,Love my stay at the PARK and here are some reason: non-smoking casino clean sleek rooms comfy beds great shower great location next to the arena eatily food court nice pool and in my opinion the best overall value on the strip.
40,Nice sized rooms but not cleaned properly let alone sanitized. Could only get a waitress on the casino floor in all 3 days. Restaurants were stupidly expensive. Ate outside the hotel the entire trip.
10,Easy check in process and finding the room. The carpets are filty... to the point where you should always wear your shoes. Mirrors had droplets of water im hoping all over them. Had to plug and unplug all cables of the tv to get it to grab signal. I found a long dried out chinese lo mein on the floor that the previous guest left me along with what appeared to be a wrapper of a liquor bottle. Dirtiest hotel room ive ever had!
50,Walking distance to so much! Plenty of food choices in the Hotel and just outside. Bed super comfy and great shower pressure! Walls are thin but didn't really bother us. Easy self checkin and checkout process. Would stay again!
50,Great accomodations friendly staff. The non-smoking casino was AWESOME!! Restaurants in-house were more than adequate. We enjoyed our stay immensely and will not stay anywhere else in Las Vegas! Totally TOP NOTCH!
50,Beautiful Nightingale suit reminded me of Italy plenty of room with two queen beds a comfortable leather ed pull out couch and a window cushion bench big enough to sleep on; not to mention the bathroom has a beautiful very large walk in shower. Plenty of room to relax even had speaker for your phone to play music. Very lovely comfortable room. Ofcourse the food is wonderful at Eatily as well!
50,This casino is so nice and the rooms ae beautiful and smell so fresh I love the non smoking what a diifernce it makes cant wait to come back!! And I won a little to but I really had fun and to me thats all that matters!! Adult Fun
10,Had to move in the middle of the night to a worse room as the hotel staff could not resolve the rowdiness in the room next to me. Had to pack and repack at 2:30am. Then no available chairs at pool. Asked for resort fee back and they basically laughed. Would not recommend this hotel for any business trips or couples.
30,Hotel and casino were clean. Rooms are small dark hallways low ceilings make the hotel feel dated on the room floor levels.  Limited options for food currently due to Covid. Location is right on the strip so convenient to many locations.
30,Not enough video poker (regular) machines; and $5 is too high for a minimum bet on a video blackjack machine. They seem to be gearing back up; but needed more waitresses in the casino and Starbucks should be open every morning!
40,We have stayed here a couple times now and always come away with a great experience! Highly recommend! Loved that the hotel and casino are now completely smoke free! Makes the stay so much more enjoyable!
10,We were excited to be here because of no smoking but the room sucked. The stay well gimmick is a waste. You don't stay well when the room is gross. There was hair everywhere crumbs on the floor stains and good in the sofa windows too dirty to see out of  air purifier was broken and makeup smeared on the walls. Because there are couches in the room I think these rooms are abused. Go elsewhere.
40,Nice location even better if are attending TMobile event. Easy to get in and out and near the highway.  Great service and staff but which they had more food options. Overall liked the place and had a nice stay with the family. Pool closes early (5pm)
50,I was pleasantly surprised by the facilities at the Park MGM. The property was clean modern sophisticated while not being ostentatious. The location was wonderful and having Eataly so close while wreaking havoc on the diet was very convenient and oh so good!
50,Great hotel! Interesting location and amazing restaurants. Free parking was convenient and easy! I would recommend visiting the restaurants in Eataly and at the park! A nice relaxing experience with great food! Head to the park if you want a calming atmosphere and tranquil Vegas vacation.
20,I placed the order at 2:14 pm the print out receipt was at 2:19 did not get the drink until 2:48 pm. I had to find someone to find the the cocktail waitress to get the drink... The drink was warm after 30 minutes when I got it....
30,We booked 2 nights here since the location was great since we didn’t have a car. The pros: great location with Eataly below Crack Shack Shake Shack within a few minutes free parking smoke free casino (fab) Starbucks downstairs. The room itself was a good size with a sofa dining table & nice walk in shower.  Cons: the hallways are very dimly lit no refrigerator or microwave in the room. I can’t stress how much a fridge would’ve been appreciated. Warm water? Warm soda? No leftovers? It sucks especially with a child. The elevators took a long while too. Overall decent night stay if you don’t mind not having a fridge or microwave. The bed was very comfortable so I can’t complain although I could hear others next door opening their blinds and talking.
50,This is a great hotel for the non smokers. Even the casino is non smoking. Rooms are spacious clean and great. My only complaint is people were smoking Marijuana right outside the doors. But I would definitely go back.
50,Staff was very helpful and friendly. rooms lobby and casino all very clean. This was my first time visiting Las Vegas and I will be staying at the park MGM on my next trip I can guarantee that. Great experience
50,Great spot on the strip room was clean and housekeeping was always on top of things. 3 nights was very affordable. This was my third stay at Park MGM in about 6 months and I'll continue to use this hotel.
30,Smoke free huge if you have allergies however room was not great for newly remolded.    Check in was great  Italian deserts and food great  Room needed help  Carpet needed cleaning  Shower clogged    Bellman service awesome!
10,I went to Craftsteak at the MGM. My steak came out over cooked. The server agreed. So he sent it back.  Jonah was some sort of manager and he brought the steak back out to me after he cut it up himself. He proceeded to belittle me in front of guests that he thought it was cooked ok. He then left the steak that he cut up for me to finish eating.  I was so mortified that I left the MGM properties that evening and will not be returning.
50,This was a great stay! Love the smoke free atmosphere throughout the entire property. Loved eating at Eataly DELICIOUS!! Loved still being so close to the big properties like Cosmo and Bellagio. Great stay would definitely stay here again!!
30,Overall lovely stay nice rooms missing a few basic accommodations (water fridge coffee after hour jacuzzi). Also room service for a cup of coffee takes over an hour. I would stay here again but definitely have to bring more of my own supplies.
40,Nice and clean and smoke free! Good location and good value compared to others. Mini fridge would be nice. The walls are very thin. We found the slots to be very tight. Get used to the weed being smoked outside.
30,Under par room cleanliness poor service at restaurant with sub par food quality with higher pricing. Table play was limited and at times unavailable. Long wait times for check in and out. Lack of staff on property.
50,For my first time visiting Las Vegas. Park MGM wowed me. From the moment We pulled up In the cab. Greeted up and walked up through the app. Didn’t have to wait in line because the app was so well put together. Staff was great and the vibes were amazing. Primrose restaurant set the standard for dining as it was he first place we ate. It was great. Thank you Park MGM for a great experience and being smoke free
50,Staff was friendly and catered to all our needs. Pool view and close to elevators fast room service everything was great. I wish I could remember their names to give acknowledgement sorry but everyone was awesome.
20,I tried to reach out to customer service because the door cut my wife’s finger and I wanted to tell them that it was poorly designed because because my mother-in-law and injury as well. But they ignored me
40,"I will return solely due to the face this is an entire non-smoking resort. My room was ""meh"" and the view I was given was less then average I loved the fact that I didn't have to breath someone else's nasty and inconsiderate smoke!"
20,The only good thing I found in the hotel what’s the location and a nice lit up casino. The restaurants half of them were closed due to Covid I understand that but the hallways to the rooms were very dingy and dark the rooms were hot when you got in them it took an hour for it to cool down we had to call maintenance to come and reduce the AC and you never see the kids in the front staff if you check in on your phone use your phone in the elevator use your phone to open your door and never once talk to a human beings person
30,It was bare minimum. The room was cheap but there theres an additional 40 dollar a day charge. There’s no amenities at all. No tub no fridge no casino staff no open restaurants bars or clubs no mlife desk during evening/night hours no room at the pool it was reserved for weeks and weeks no seating in the lobby no stores in the hotel open most of the time.
50,It was my 25th birthday and we really enjoyed staying at Park MGM. The atmosphere was relaxed and friendly. Definitely passed the vibe check. The check in and checkout process was simple and efficient and everything was clean organized. We didn’t have a single issue the whole stay. Cannot wait to stay again soon!
30,The clerk that checked me in was confused unprofessionaland incompetent. She kept asking for my players card number which is has nothing to do with chek in also she wanted my credit card for incidental even though I already gave it to herand they already put a hold on my cc.
30,We usually like to stay at Park MGM - well located nice rooms great vibe and now no smoking! This time though all that was diluted because of their so-so handling of COVID-19 protocols. We didn't see a lot of cleaning in the common areas nor did we see mask mis-wearers called out. Yikes! So disappointing to see this at an MGM Resorts property.
50,We love this hotel. Cool rooms with hardwood and tile flooring. Neat bathtub in the room and nice sitting area. Also really like that this property is non-smoking. The casino is smaller but easy to navigate.
50,We have stayed at Park MGM during it’s renovation phase when after it converted from the Monte Carlo and recently in February. We really miss the lazy river pool but the changes to the hotel have made it more contemporary. The rooms are really sleek and decorated beautifully. The beds are comfortable big TVs strong showers and great views. EATALY is awesome the food in the court is delicious whether you eat at La Pizza en la Pasta or have one of their scrumptious items at the kiosks. The staff is great you can check in on your own but we prefer human interaction. You have a choice. The fact that the hotel is non smoking also makes it easy on the lungs as with mask restrictions you are not smelling smoke on your masks. We have also gone to concerts at the hotel and the arena is an awesome place to see your favorite artist. It is a great weekend getaway for us.
30,The bed was really worst part of the stay. It’s hard as a rock and the blanket and bedding is cheap and thin. Also the food options are $$$$ for every meal. Breakfast was like $60 for two! It’s a non-smoking hotel/casino so that’s nice. It was also very clean. We spent most of our time at the New York New York.
10,Likely will not be returning. Booked reservation as an American Express Centurion member. Was supposed to get an upgrade at check in. Given an inferior room looking out to a garage. Only after contacting the Centurion desk were we able to get the room changed the following morning. Have not received a copy of my room receipt either. Told it would be emailed at check out. Unacceptable.
40,We stayed here twice in 2 weeks and overall it's a decent property especially since for a mid tier hotel on the strip. No it's not the Bellagio or Venetian so I wouldn't compare it to that but it's fine otherwise. The rooms aren't very big but its an OK size and its completely renovated so you'll find all the USB plugs etc that you'd expect. The bathrooms also looked nicely renovated.    My complaint is the thin walls between rooms. Because of a noisy neighbor we had to have our rooms changed since we could hear the TV and music from the room next door. It was much better after changing rooms but I could easily hear the shower next door.
50,Truly enjoyed our stay at Park MGM (I think we were in the Nomad Hotel wing). The room was beautifully and tastefully decorated and clean. Casino was smoke-free and plenty of dining options within the hotel complex. Centrally located!
30,Every year twice a year I go to Vegas for The World Market every year I choose to stay at a different hotel this year maybe maybe not because of Covid I was very disappointed. At check in I was required to place $300.00 damage deposit for my room once I got to the room it had 7’ ceilings and about enough square footage to turn around in no coffee no bottled water limited time on room service restaurants & Starbucks closed three days (the ones I was there) I was pleased with the location though right next to New York New York where I spent every dime breakfast Starbucks Broadway Burger America Gonzales Gonzales and of coarse the casino ah yes the casino
20,My advise put everything on one credit card in case you need to dispute anything. Also look out for human hair on the towels or dark black spots. Bring your own toilet paper trust me not soft felt like newspaper.    Track the cost at front desk you might find an error here and there. Other than that felt like Holiday Express in a decent location of the strip. Don't expect the BEST RATE GUARANTEE people to give you anything if you find it some other third party website cheaper go for it!    You might find some stars in this place cleaning ladies are the sweetest that's about it.
30,Hotel was fine for our stay. Nothing fancy but affordable. We had an issue with the air conditioner and it was never taken care of. The offer a mobile app for your room key. Do not use it as it only works half the time. Get an actual room card if you stay here.
50,We are non-smokers and while the no smoking policy for the room was nice we still had to deal with the smoke in the casino before. NOW the no smoking policy in the casino is terrific as we don't have to deal with smoke on our clothes!
50,We had one of the Nighthawk Suites. Beautiful. One of the nicest rooms we have ever stayed in. Only thing missing was a refrigerator and a coffee pot. Otherwise perfect. Great view. Clean. Declined housekeeping and they delivered plenty of towels for our stay.
40,Nice room clean quiet. Staff was all friendly. Some restaurants still closed due to covid leaving choices limited but other than that great stay. Definately recommend to anyone visiting Vegas. Also great location close to everything.
30,Rooms little outdated and the appliances in the room but okay for a one night trip...the lobby was cute & the restaurants offered...just thought the rooms would match the aesthetic of the entire hotel
30,This property just has a facelift on the old Monte Carlo. They changed the pool area by removing the lazy River and wave pool and replacing them with three small unimpressive squares. The room are bland and mine was not overly clean. The tram was not operating the whole time I was there and with covid restrictions very little is open Sunday through Wednesday.
50,Stayed at Park MGM Room was very clean. People very friendly. No trouble at all with pools that others talked about due to covid restrictions. Only bad was gambling trying to make up for losses all at once.
10,The room was dirty ... windows were dusty ... toilet paper was the cheapest ... the bed and pillows was so uncomfortable.  We wanted to use our phone key app ... even that stopped working .... we got stuck in elevator on because the phone key wouldn’t work  It was inconvenient for us to go get a card key downstairs
50,Ive stayed at numerous hotels in Vegas including many 5 star resorts. This past stay we had at the Park MGM was the best so far. Extremely clean impeccable hospitality and a great overall experience.
30,The Park MGM was affordable for the number of days we were guests along with good customer service. The cleaning of the room was only late once out of our four nights stay. The location was great and the hotel was definitely clean. Appreciated the security in the elevator lobby ensuring everyone had on a mask and offering one to those that did not.
40,Pros:  The shower water pressure is great.  The gym is clean and spacious.  The dining options are good and varied.  The staff was professional and kind.  Parking is easy.  Pet friendly (has a small grass area for dogs)    Cons:  No fridge in room  AC barely functioned  Room was very very dusty!!! Visibly so.  Our room smelled like cigarettes (so bad that we left early)
50,Overall satisfied with the whole stay at Park MGM. It was my husband and I's first time staying there. Location was perfect. Non smoking casino which is a plus. We will be going back for sure with the kiddos.
10,If you want a dust allergy this is the place to be. Every surface was covered in dust. There was a bottle cap on the floor. Just pure filth for a $300 one night stay. Walls are thin as paper and you can hear the entire conversation as well as phone alarms from your neighbors. Hallways gave a creepy vibe. Overall never will stay and never will recommend.
40,Low price nice pool area (3 seperate pools) and restaurant choices. Room was a little small (king bed room) nothing fancy but great deal for the price. Great customer service for anyone we interacted with. The area's we visited were clean and people wore masks.
10,Park Mgm was not what I expected tv had no signal at all we couldn’t watch tv like at all and then one of the bed blankets had a blood stained like hopefully they will take care of it I had to check out a day before because I was just uncomfortable.
50,We had a fantastic stay. Good food and drink here. Non-smoking casino was outstanding. Love this place and will stay here again... and again. The pool was clean and the service was spot-on. Check in and out were a breeze through the app.
50,This place is clean and smoke free. It was really clean and comfortable for my during my stay. The staff was nice and friendly and helpful. I enjoyed the decor and the cleanliness of the place. The room was comfortable and clean.
10,The carpet in hallway was extremely dirty and old. It was dark and scary. Room was hot ac doesn't work well. It was small and needs updating. No food choices at all no food court. I will never stay here again.
40,Not a lot to put down other than the rooms were clean the non smoking casino was amazing checkin and check out were quick pools were clean and sunny. This is a new go-to resort for me.    Casino experience was great as said above but it can’t be understated how much the non-smoking environment will save your throat and sinuses.
30,Our room was not well cleaned upon check in so we had to get another room and then the sticker shock of $100 deposit a day on top of resort feesthats a little to much.Really like staying here before.
30,If you love the MGM Park or Nomad for the lack of smoke you already know what a treat it is for that reason alone. But that's about it. Rooms are okay clean and hotel is nice enough. The quick dining options aren't good both in terms of service or quality of food. Stick to the restaurants and make reservations in advance. We actually order drinks at the bar and pay for them and tip too but it was really frustrating having to wait for 10-15 min with one worker taking care of 20 customers. The food was warmed up inadequately since they were rushing everything.
50,Park MGM has become my favorite spot! Good crowed great food nice rooms free gym no smoking amazing location! Love Mama Rabbits the Haus of Gaga and all the other things that are located on the property.
20,Room was dirty found a dental pick on the night stand an (unmentionable) stain on the couch. AC never cooled completely despite being set to 60 for 2 days. The shower sprayed you so hard it hurt and the water was extremely hard.
10,Staying at the hotel for the first time my wife and two children were moved to 3 different rooms in a span of 2-3 hours. One of the rooms wreaked of smoke when this hotel is known for being “smoke free”.
50,Very nice staff and hotel. Some safety precautions taken. Cleaning staff seen every where. I would cone back again once the pandemic is over.  Concierge were attentive offered solutions and conpensation immediately. Beautiful Hotel close to everything.
10,Mold on wall next to the iron table.  Paint all over the window.  Ripped blanket from a corner.    Being our first time in Las Vegas with the type of room I booked was very upsetting.  I didn't think the room I rented was going to be as ugly as it was.    Next time I'm definitely staying at Cesars. However the outside of the hotel was beautiful.
30,I booked this hotel because it's the only smoking free hotel in Vegas. Because of the pandemic it's hard to smoke with a mask so could have stayed anywhere. The food choices here are very limited and impossible to get into a nice restaurant for dinner. Few table games were open during the day and the casino was very cold.
50,Me & my boyfriend went to Vegas for the first time and stayed at Park MGM. From the day we got to Vegas to the time we left everyone was extremely friendly and enjoyed talking to us. The hotel room was very nice! The showers were amazing!!! We stayed in the shower for about 30 minutes each time. The beds were so comfortable and the sheets were very warm. We’re from Atlanta and are definitely considering moving to Vegas in the near future.
50,The app check in and out and using your phone for room key was awesome. No lines just straight to the room. Rooms are sparse be huge and very very clean. Beds are comfortable. Love the long couch by the window. Bathroom are beautiful. Amenities are great. 3 pools to choose from lots of options. Food options are great as well.
10,No water bottles in the room. Woke up at 4 A.M. got dressed went to the casino floor and found literally no stores or restaurants were open. Had to exit the casino and go to a different casino to do buy water and a snack!    Room service hours are limited from 7 A.M. to 2 P.M. Yet no one answered despite waiting on home from 7-7:25 A.M. so once again we had to leave the casino for breakfast because the only thing actually open was a Starbucks and a pastry store.    If you value non alcoholic drinks and an actual meal between the hours of 11 P.M. and 10 A.M. then stay somewhere else !
20,Our room we paid for an upgrade for a strip view which was sub par at best. There was a horrible sewer smell in the room and we went and complained and we were giving a couple of low amount vouchers. We wanted to be moved to another room. The sink and tub didn’t drain and the windows were very dirty when you want to enjoy a view.
40,I love that the hotel/casino is non-smoking! I was on a business trip and it was nice to NOT have to walk through a wall of smoke and smell it on myself and my coworkers all day.  I also truly appreciated the water pressure in the shower.  The only thing I didn't like was how easily you can hear everything in your neighbors' rooms. I could even hear them raise/lower their black-out blinds.
50,Awesome atmosphere of the Hotel as a whole from restaurants to bars and casino my favorite. Also a smoke free hotel so that is always a plus. Staff is extremely friendly and helpful my go to hotel in vegas
40,My wife and I took a break from our home and had a nice time at the parkmgm.drove there Saturday evening came home next day. Had a nice meal at the eatry(probably spelled wrong).played some slots together and had a lot of fun.
50,I haven’t been to this hotel since it was the Monte Carlo. Beautifully redone with a much nicer casino and the room was very comfortable. The only downfall was the selection of restaurants and coffee shops being closed because of the pandemic.
10,I understand that you can’t stop people from smoking in a no smoking room.....but for God’s Sake! You guys sell smokes in the gift shop!!!! The profits from cigars and cigarettes can’t be worth the damage to the properties reputation! !!!!
10,Rooms are not up kept the dust was unbearable literally. The lobby and casino is clean but the rooms upstairs are a completely different story. The downstairs and images on line is how they wheel you in.
30,When this property first opened it was pretty nice - nothing “stand-out” per say - but very clean modern basic accommodations. I have stayed at the Park 4 times and my most recent stay left some to be desired. Down in quality cleanliness in common areas (hallways elevators slots in casino) Staff was unfriendly when asked where dining accommodations were since there were none available on property at 9o’clock at night. I was told to go across the street to Denny’s or next-door properties and that if I didn’t like it I needed to “take it up with the governor”. Wow. And can we please bring regular room service back already??
50,Great stay! First time at Park and had a great deal for 3 nights. Water pressure and temp was terrific. Beds were super comfortable as was the couch to lounge in. Rooms and floors were easily accessible with the app or a card key that could be printed out in the lobby. Perfect location to walk to around the whole strip. Non smoking hotel and casino which made breathing much easier
30,The food and service here was great the staff outstanding the place is clean smoke free clean very well-maintained I was extremely happy with the overall experience here are the MGM properties are great
50,We had a little snag with our sink getting backed up. Call for maintenance and a very well knowledgeable gentleman by the name of Michael came and took care of it quickly. I'm very satisfied with the engineering Department especially with Michael great personality.
30,Half of Eataly was closed as well as most of the restaurants in the hotel. So we left to go eat breakfast lunch and dinner at other casinos. Seems like a missed opportunity there.  Don't get any liquor that isn't premade at the bar. So stick to beer n shots. It's the only 2 drinks the bartenders do well... I ordered a Cosmo tasted just like gasoline. I ordered a vodka & cranberry I figured 2 things shouldn't be hard. It tasted like gasoline. They clearly do not know how to craft a cocktail. We left there and went to other casinos to gamble & have drinks. Seems like a missed opportunity there.  Lastly room's are nice. It will take literally the entire day to get your room cleaned. They're so understaffed. Also no mini fridge for your water or leftovers.  So basically if you need a bed to sleep in Park MGM is nice. If you want to eat drink and gamble pretty much EVERYWHERE else is better!
50,Check-in was very easy with their app and totally contactless. Employees were at the front desk ready to help if needed. The room I selected was exactly as expected. The hotel was very clean and smoke-free which was an added bonus. Eataly and Primrose are excellent places to eat. It's located in the center of the strip so it's easy to get anywhere walking. 10/10 would definitely stay here again.
40,Easy check in as always and very friendly staff waiting to help you check in. Security helping everyone get to the right elevator and with safety as a priority. Sanitizers everyone and masks available at all entrances. Rooms are very spacious and very clean as well. NON SMOKING!!! My favorite part! Great food choices and great sports book. Bars and service while gambling was excellent (Good tips help). This was my 3rd stay here since January 2020 and all stays have exceeded my expectations. Almost forgot I went with family and was able to get all of our rooms on the same floor and 2 of them together with adjoining doors.
50,First of the parking is great and easily accessible. The hotel in general is really nice and the staff are really nice. The casino is small compared to others but it is smoke free which is a plus to certain clientele. The availability of check in and out is awesome especially due to covid. Overall I would stay here again especially if you have an event at the TMobile Arena.
50,Loved the no smoking atmosphere! Clean and comfortable. Very easy check-in using my cell phone. Rooms were clean and didn't stink of stale smoke. Would highly reccomend to anyone who wants a great location at a great price.
40,If you just need a room for sleeping that is clean and newish with no smoking then this should be your choice. Mattresses & air conditioner should be replaced but tolerable for the money. Housekeeping needs to spif up there services weren’t up to par
30,I paid extra for an early check-in and forget about it. The room was ready almost by 2pm. The regular check-in is 3pm and I was supposed to be able to enter at 11am with the fee. Not worth it don't pay extra.
50,Perfect location right off the strip. Staff is very friendly and eager to help. Plenty of food places within the hotel and entertainment. Hotel is very clean and a different little dog park vibe. Random walls through out the hotel are perfect for all your photo needs.
30,We were on the 4th floor so my kids was very disappointed that they didn't get to see from up high but beside that it was a good stay. The rooms were a good size to my and my kids. The couch was long enough where it fit all of us.
50,This bed was sooo comfortable. I will definitely stay longer next time to give me a full day just laying down chillin. The hotel and casino floor very clean and love the decor. Need to figure out the self check-in more on the mobile app. For some reason it wasn't working when I checked in
30,PRO's: Ed & Maurico at the front door gave us a friendly and sincere welcome upon arrival. Bed was comfortable and clean. I felt safe with here lots of uniformed security visible smoke free so that's a plus and the location was perfect for what we wanted.  CON's: Food we ordered was worst I have ever consumed in my life. Over baked Roman Pizza was a waste of money and waste of time plus it caused us jaw pain I don't know what it is like to eat wood but the way they overbaked the pizza I think I know now what eating wood is like.    Shower door in hotel room did not seal properly. Unbeknownst to me when I showered it flooded the bathroom floor with water. I stepped out of shower and almost fell due to water everywhere leaking from poorly sealed bathroom door. We used most of our towels to dry up the water and when we called front desk they let us know engineering would respond after we checked out the next day to fix it. No apology from any of the staff members were reported for the flooding. Also no offer for new/clean towels since ours were used to dry up the mess but it didn't matter cause we couldn't use the shower anyway due to the door not sealing shut.  Had the pizza been edible and the staff been more responsive to assist us or at least offered an apology I would have given this property.    With all that said... hear this. I would have given this property a great score overall if not for the issues listed here. if hotel staff focuses on customer service as much as they do on security this place will be a regular place we will stay at. It's COVID times so most eateries being closed is understandable however come on PARK MGM if you're only going to have a handful of places open to eat can they please serve better pizza? Every family we saw serving the Roman pizza to a kid was soon thereafter throwing it away no kids liked it too hard to chew.
40,My wife and I stayed at Park MGM recently and liked the experience. Our bed was the most comfortable we’ve ever slept in for a hotel food at Eataly was terrific and the hotel was close to most places on the Strip. Only disappointment was several taverns and restaurants were closed but there were no signage to indicate that. Also the room could use a mini-refrigerator.
30,Right in the middle of the Las Vegas strip. Hosts a really good bottomless brunch at Primerose that it both indoor and outdoor. Don’t expect much in the standard rooms as they are standard for a reason.
30,Ive stayed before and service was great the service was not good this time and room was not cleaned either not sure 8f people in elevators were guests because couldnt get to room floor requested they didnt have a card. Didnt feel safe and people not wearing mask in elevators and there was not social distance at all
30,"more of a large hotel room than a suite the nighthawk was perfectly adequate. i appreciate park mgm's generally modernized rooms perfectly comfortable and the non-smoking environment is especially appreciated. but not really a true suite in that the only separate rooms are basically a foyer and walk-in closet. the bathroom is spacious but has no tub. there is a fully-stocked minibar but no fridge or in-room coffee. getting what you need in terms of a quick coffee or water can be a chore as it will involve either waiting for service in a restaurant or navigating the burdensome bottleneck of the ""eataly"" food court experience on the other side of the casino from the hotel rooms. the joints on the near end all stop serving by 2pm including starbucks -- and as does room service. in-room amenities really should be upgraded as it's a tiresome drag to set an alarm just to make the coffee hour after a late night when i just want to sleep in and have a nice relaxing start as late as i happen to get up."
30,This is a smoke-free property which is awesome. The air conditioner cuts off in the middle of the night. We called maintenance twice. After changing the filter flushing the system and entering a code that was supposed to override this feature twice the air still cut off nightly. If you do not sleep well warm or hot this is not the place for you. Nothing is really worse than being on vacation and not being able to sleep well. Do not pay for strip view. You basically have a view of the roof. You can only see a very small portion of the strip and it’s hard to get past the ugly roof. We paid extra and were on Floor 22 and it was not worth it. Maybe it’s better if you are on a higher floor.
40,I have always liked staying at Park MGM but I stayed there just this past weekend and I was looking for the food court. They don’t have one. They do have Eataly. Which is all Italian style eating. I tried some pizza and it was very hard and dry. I didn’t try anything else there. Sometimes you just want a quick burrito or a sandwich. Nothing is quick or cheap about Eataly. I didn’t like it.
50,Great Room amazing deal on the room had no issues checking in and out or no issues with the room at all either. i will be staying here more often when i visit. The hotel is arguably one of the best hotels available on the strip.
10,Room was terrible small many issues to mention TV did not work filthy windows killing the view Air Conditioning did not work room was very basic very small hallway carpets look like their 50 years old so this is how MGM treats there return customers.
40,My son and I stayed there last weekend during Easter weekend and it seemed like people were crazy and ready to be done with COVID restrictions. It seemed like the hotel staff really did their best to keep up with demand and was trying to help get us checked in as quickly as possible and get room cleaned. Room was clean and since pool looked packed we avoided it. Bell staff was great and Eataly and Starbucks service was great. We went to the Vegas Knights hockey game across the street and loved that the hotel was so close. The parking was free and very convenient. I also like the location on the strip. We were out on strip after 10PM on Saturday night walking after strip and it was too crowded and too many people drunk for a kid....in past more people were indoors in the bars and clubs but things change. I still love Las Vegs and will return...maybe without a kid(s) or when things open indoors more. Vegas Knights game was awesome especially since the Wild won : )
40,Great trip. While this property wasn't on the strip the property was not in a bad location and was an easy walk to everything. The property is new and updated on the amenities floors however the rooms are slightly old and run down.
20,The hotel is noticeably old (previously the Monte Carlo). Ceilings are low with no micro kitchen. You can tell MGM tried hard to make the rooms less dated but the result is a weird mix of vintage/modern decor. The rooms have no sound proofing at all. The curtain pulls from a neighbor’s room woke me up in the middle of the night (and I’m a heavy sleeper!). Also heard many strange noises in the middle of the night like pipes creaking. However I appreciate the hotel is non smoking (even on the casino floor which is great!) and the great location relative to the strip.
50,The hotel is non-smoking which is a huge plus. Very clean rooms casino eating area and lobby. The location of the hotel is awesome if you like to sit outside and enjoy the sun and people watch...lots of out door seating next to the hotel.
30,Had some problems as rooms seem a bit thin on walls and when people party at 3am and are loud it is a little hard to sleep. The rooms are ok and the staff was very friendly at the front desk to the shops at the hotel.
40,I had a great experience for my 41st birthday which was supposed to be 40th but bcuz of C-19 had to cancel last year. The staff were very nice and helpful. Definitely would stay there again. Maybe I’ll bring a cooler and have a microwave niece time lol. 😆
50,My wife and I enjoyed our stay at the now smoke-free Park MGM. The property is very nice and feels less chaotic than other properties on the Strip. With 3 pools food options and hallway access to the Aria we were never bored. It's possible to walk all the way to the Bellagio from the Park MGM via the Aria and Vdara hotels (only 1 minute of that walk is outside). I would recommend this property especially for those that are sensitive to smoke.
10,The Park MGM lobby is beautiful but the rooms remind you of a cheap motel room. If you want to get some sleep don’t stay here after switching rooms I still had loud in considerate neighbors and security never shows up. Rooms smelled like someone was smoking weed in it. Save your money stay at a motel 6 it will be the same experience.
10,The room we got was absolutely disgusting. We found multiple hairs in the shower and droplets of blood in the shower and close of the toilet the toilet was also not cleaned and the soapdish was disgusting and was not cleaned from the previous user. There was stuck on gunk of soap and hair on the dish soap the entire room was dusty and there were crumbs in the beds. We requested another room and although it was better than the first one it was still very dusty and we found fingerprints on the mirrors and on the windows overlooking the strip and we found hairs in the shower. Sandra was very friendly checking us in and Taryn at the cabana was very friendly as well. Other than that we will NEVER stay here again. I took video of the room and it’s condition. I was uncomfortable the entire time. We asked for a room cleaning and they didn’t make the beds. They tidied up the bathroom and took out the trash. That’s it.
40,Fastest checkin in checkin history and ive stayed at over 50 hotels in the last 10 years besides the checkin lady who was amazing i feel like they do need more of a food selection otherwise it would be a 5/5 for me
30,Great room but neighbors were loud and smoking marijuana. Front desk staff didn’t do anything about it. Otherwise hotel would have been a ten! People need to follow hotels no smoking inside rules stated all over the hotel.
30,Hotel section was outdated and dingy. No glamour. Room service ends at 2pm which is absolutely ridiculous in my opinion. Minimum accommodations available. Restaurants were all delicious with great service however.
10,They advertise that the hotel is smoke free but we were put in a room with an adjoining room door next to strangers even though our party had three rooms booked (we were not put next to each other). The persons Nextdoor to us smoked weed and cigarettes every day on our three day stay and it seeped into our room through the shared suite door. We had to use towels to block the cigarette smoke coming from under the door into our room. I have a toddler and was concerned for their and our health with the weed and cigarette smoke coming into the room. I had nightmares from the smell during my stay it was so nauseating. The walls were thin and I could hear their conversations (and I imagine they heard ours too!) and they played music loud all day even louder than our room TV.
50,The rooms were very nice and cozy. The food options were great! The staff was wonderful and we were able to check in and check out quickly. The casino wasn’t overcrowded which was very comfortable for us. The only downfall were the very thin walls. Outside noise can be heard very easily so much so that it was able to wake me up. I understand a level of noise being able to be hears however this I felt was too much.
30,Beautiful property but security needs a lot of customer service training. I bought food for my child at on property restaurant and was told “policy changed” overnight and I couldn’t let her eat it. I asked them to refund “nope that’s your problem”
30,There's false advertising of rollaway bed for the reservation. This property has no sofa bed or rollaway for the family. Also there's no fridge to our surprise. The staff and manager were stubborn in handling the issues.
30,Casino is very tight and felt like it just ate our money up. Usually had to walk to another location/ property ( luxor mandalay bay ECT) just to feel like a winner. The rooms were ok. Overall the new look monte carlo is very meh.
30,Room wasn't fully prepared when we entered (crumbs on couch safe was locked less than minimal drinking glasses and sets of towels provided for a room that sleeps 4) limited morning gambling table availability all elevators were not in operation leading to increased waiting time to get to room especially on Saturday.
50,Enjoyed the stay for our 3rd Anniversary. First time staying at the Park. Usually stay at MGM Luxor or Excalibur. Basically connected to Tmobile Arena which is a major plus. Eataly is wonderful. The only complaint is still decor in rooms and beds slightly stiff. But otherwise we loved the pool. Our pool drink waitress was awesome. She is in top shape too keep those drinks coming. Thank you again.
50,Park MGM seems to be the best you can get on a budget on the strip in vegas. Friendly staff clean rooms that are spacious and usually have a decent view. We also love that it is completely smoke free and connected to Eataly. We will definitely stay here again.
50,My hotel stay was pleasant I slept well room was very cool housekeeping was nice room service was good and timely my checking was great. Being that I worked in a hotel industry for 12 years as a bellman at the Hollywood Roosevelt hotel your hotel was really nice the lobby was like a hotel lobby and then I felt like a casino check-in easy check in through the lobby of your hotel first and then all of the hotel amenities the room is really nice and all staff that I come in contact with was really nice as well..
50,Overall the stay at park MGM was fantastic. The atmosphere was very lively there were a lot of options for food the room was clean and it was such a cute hotel. Staff was friendly and attentive. Highly recommend for anyone looking to stay centrally on the strip!
50,It was a great trip the hotel was great and the staff were all very courteous. The new COVID restrictions were good. The cleanliness was great and sanitize areas were well kept. The casino was a good size and the number of slots was nice.
50,This entire experience was Great we enjoyed every from the rooms to the hospitality and the games and the cleanliness thank you so much for all that amazing things you guys have in the hotel will go again.
50,Park MGM has a great location. It is in the middle of the strip - it is very clean bright and smoke free. We checked in and out from our phones (touch-free). The staff was very helpful and friendly.
50,This was the perfect hotel for my family. The smoke-free atmosphere is the best and we’ll definitely be back for this reason alone. It’s also so clean and the style of the hotel casino and rooms were so fresh. Also loved the restaurants attached and the option of having 3 pools.
50,The service was wonderful awesome  the doorman front desk staff housekeeping concierge Spa Staff security- every employee we encountered was very kind helpful I did not have not one negative experience!!! Room was very nice always very clean!! The safety kits in room with mask & hand sanitizer were a very nice & thoughtful gift safety was definitely a top priority at this hotel!! I felt very safe!! I Would highly recommend this hotel the location is excellent too!! Very very affordable!
30,Blah for Vegas. Eataly was disappointing mostly because only half of the stations were open. Sports book worse on the strip.. gift shops closed early...no energy. Location is great and so was no smoking
50,The rooms are dark but spacious. I enjoyed the Nightingale suite conveniently near the elevators . Ideal location. Easy parking and friendly staff. My friends were very impressed with Eataly and enjoyed the food.
30,Semi ok - restaurant not very handicap friendly  Couldn't use our recent smartphone to get into our room  Put a hold on the full amount on our checking account which made us having bounced checks even though we had paid for some of it.
20,We need less mask policing when walking around when it’s not crowded. Some people have a very hard time breathing in those things and when you are able to maintain distance we need to use good judgement vs yelling at guests.
50,I have never stayed at the Park MGM before but I’m very happy that I did. Every staff member I passed greeted me with a friendly smile or hello. All the direct interactions I had with them were friendly concise and welcoming. The Primrose was delicious and the front desk staff were quick to answer any questions I had.
50,My family and I just had an unexpected travel delay due to airlines and landed ourselves at Park MGM for a 4-night stay. It was a wonderful experience from start to finish. Great rooms most pleasant and accommodating staff all-around perfect location clean and Covid conscious. Would definitely return!!
10,Worst mLife Hotel in Vegas . Supposed to be an “Upper Class” property with non smoking  was sold to me as being one of the highest class properties on the strip  NOT EVEN ! I made my reservation though LHRC and I’m a Platinum mlife member  they Bait-And-Switched my resort credit with SPA credit  the check In experience was AWFUL ! I offered to pay for a larger room and was told no that I had one of their best rooms “stay well” — burnt bathroom vanity mold in the aromatherapy cup mold and dust on the air purifier  no working phone in the room  I drove 10 hours to be here?!?! Customer service did not care about me at all when I told them that I was supposed to get $100 resort credit they said we just change that yesterday even though their website did not show any of this.. The staff is INEPT . This was an AWFUL EXPERIENCE BEWARE this could happen to you.
50,The big thing that I loved about this hotel/casino is that it is smoke free. Air smells clean and barricades in the casino give me a sense of security. Rooms are also nice compared to the usual rooms I’ve stayed in during past trips to Vegas (downtown).
10,Disappointed the money I spent I expected more order a king bed they told me I’m sorry only have 2 queens they gave me store credit 150 which was fine get to the room the phone doesn’t work ...no house keeping from Friday to Monday was horrible after I ask a million times
50,Location is awesome. Great rooms with couch and pool is awesome. One of fav places in Vegas. Eataly awesome food and drink addition. Live music Saturday was awesome. Staff at pool was friendly will be back
30,The staff was very pleasant. I did not like that the room was too warm and you to pay to reserve a seat in the bar next to the sportsbook during March Madness. I could not enjoy the games with gamblers
20,The check in process was ridiculous unless you used the check in on your phone process. The fridge is for them and if anything is moved they'll try to charge you which is complete BS. They just need to add a mini fridge for their guest and o there's no microwave either. O and I had a suite with a strip view but from the 9th floor the buildings block your view. You can only see directly In front of you and you can't even see people walking. Just a Ross and Hard Rock guitar from 9-301 which is a 2Q Nightingale Suite. Why would you put a suite in such a low floor?
50,Park MGM was awesome. One of the main reasons was the non smoking environment. I can go upstairs after a day or night of drinks and playing without the smell of smoke. Everyone was friendly and we love Little Eatily.
50,Purpose of my stay was to celebrate my friend's 30th birthday. The hotel was very clean and the staff were friendly. The hotel has many digital features (Mobile Room Key) that make checking-in and checking-out a breeze.
50,I highly recommend the Park MGM. It’s clean the workers are friendly and helpful and it’s centrally located on the strip. The food at the Eataly the Italian marketplace is awesome. The casino is just the right size (not too big where you get lost). And best of all it’s right across the street from T-Mobile Arena which is convenient when we come to Vegas to see our hockey team play or for a concert. Great place to stay!
10,Was treated very unprofessional by front desk staff Stacy. Cancelled my reservation when I was at the counter where else would I go if I was already there all I asked was if I could have a room closer to family member
10,Very rude front desk attendant  she was getting annoyed of the questions we were asking this was our first time staying at this hotel so we just wanted to know what was open and what amenities they had  Got a noise complaint as soon as we got there even though we were sleeping  Ruined me and my wife’s honeymoon  Will not be staying here again
50,Very nice place to stay friendly staff and the location was perfect for a mini getaway. The room rate because of M- life was fantastic. They do need to update the bathrooms. Yes we are in the middle of Covid but the food choices need more of a variety.
30,The property is ok but could use some updating to the rooms. The rooms are outdated. I enjoyed that the property is smoke free. I would like to see more things for families to do there. The Italy theme is great but get a better variety of food.
10,Over crowded. It took my wife and I almost 2 hours driving around in the parking structure to find parking. Luckily someone recommended parking in the aria structure. Then the next day as we tried to return to our room we waited 45 minutes to a hour just to get onto the elevator. We stay at mgm hotels all the time and this was our worst experience we are going back out in 2 weeks and might start staying somewhere new because how bad this experience was. Also the room seemed a lot smaller than other hotels and the walls were so thin we were able to hear the people on both sides of us. One had a baby that cried all night and the other side they just argued. Overall it was a very bad experience.
10,This was my wedding anniversary trip and instead of relaxing after celebrating and sleeping in we were awaken very early by construction and drilling next to our room. When we contacted management they were very rude and stated that it was day time and that we should be up. This managers name was Tony. We had stayed up and celebrated in Park MGM and spent a lot of money there. When we contacted the front desk to get a call back from her boss Remy we never received a call back. When paying for a room you should not have to get a curfew or a wake call after celebrating your wedding anniversary the night before. We had already had a problem with standing in a very long line to get up to the room because they decided to pack everyone on one side of the hotel. Plus there was no air on in the casino or hallways. The vending machines had hot drinks and the tv plus internet was constantly going in and out. The room and the cleaning staff were great and the location was not bad. But inside all the restaurants did not stay open too late and most of the time we crossed over to NYNY. Which will probably be our go to from now on when we go back to Las Vegas and we go on a regular basis.
50,I was highly satisfied with my stay at Park MGM. The Suite was very nice and appealing the view of the pool was nice as well. I don’t smoke and liked that it was smoke free. Can’t say the same for my friends but they enjoyed their stay as well.
20,This property was not upgraded when they renovated it. The walls seem to be somehow thinner than a tent. As I was arriving at my FIRST room I could hear a woman yelling down the hallway (from inside a room). As I entered my room I could hear a child crying and her yelling--even more loudly than down the hall. The front desk was about to move me without much issue--because I called straight away. I moved floors and had a decent night's sleep on Thursday. On Friday I got neighbors. Bless their hearts--they were on vacation and I can't begrudge them their right to have a nice time--but it was at my expense. I had to go buy earplugs from the drug store and blast the white noise from my phone in order to block out their evening intimacies. Oh yes--and again in the morning. Since I could hear them I didn't feel comfortable even watching TV in my room. I left a day early because it was THAT BAD.    On the upside the beds are firm--which is definitely a plus when I take a trip. I am a stomach sleeper and I really appreciate being able to sleep--once I can block out the noise from my neighbors.
50,I loved my stay here nice and clean will come back again this year . Every thing close by. Good service easy check in and check out . Nice casino and good way to have a good weekend with friends and family
50,The hotel has a warm and inviting vibe. With an accommodating friendly staff thats always ready to help with anything. The hotel is clean and is the first Smoke-free casino on the strip which is a major plus and family friendly.
20,We could not sleep. The walls are very thin and you can hear the neighbors. At 2:30 am someone was checking in next to us. They were arguing speaking loud and slamming things. I called the front desk and they sent security but at no time did security tell them to quiet down and they were making noise until 3:30 am. The casino slot machines were filithy and I did not observe anyone cleaning them even during this pandemic.
50,Vegas is open for fun! Stayed at the Park MGM which was fantastic! Great location on the strip great access to shows and food venues and the Spa was fantastic! Felt very safe with social distancing and masks in all public spaces. #vegassafe
50,It was very good beside waiting to check in also the bed are always comfortable been going there since September . It has great pool ect and also no smoking is allow so it good to know your not inhaling thay tabocco smoke
40,PARK MGM is a must stay hotel when traveling to Las Vegas. The staff was very helpful. Everyone was very attentive to the guest needs. Although my reservations got pushed back because of a flight delay they still assisted me
40,We had a nice room that was clean but not terribly comfortable. Bed was really hard and the air circulation was really poor. We found it to be stuffy and hot. We played with the thermostat to cool it down or at least engage the fan but we had only minor success with those adjustments. There was also no mini fridge. We usually hit a drug store and get monsters and beer for the morning. We had to put ice in the sink to keep our drinks cold. At least the ice machine was close.
50,If you're looking for somewhere clean and very aesthetically pleasing look no further than Park MGM! 10/10. And being a vegas local I have seen it all. Such friendly staff and an amazingly clean property.
50,Love the new look and feel of the park I am an old firefighter and now have lung issues and i am very allergic to smoke this is my first trip i did not get sick LOVE IT I will be back! Eataly is a Wonderful place to eat as well lots of good food choices in the Park
50,What more can I say about this place. As soon as I arrived in line I was greeted with a smile even though the front desk clerk was wearing her mask. Check in and check out was quick. I had no problems. The room was clean and had a nice view. The bed was so comfortable! I will be staying here from now on when I visit Vegas again. Thank you for providing me excellent customer service and an excellent stay.
50,Excellent food court if you love Italian food. Rooms are clean and modern. Be aware that you will use your food credit by charging the food to your room. M life desk cannot credit any food that you paid for back to your rewards card.
40,During that stay. Cleanse was awesome. And during the covid sanitation was amazing.    And Etely restaurants were awesome.  Sadly room was ok it is clean but didn’t like the there was no enough space to put clothes in  And they use 1 door for close restroom and closet.
20,Rooms carpets and floors were dirty throw up near elevators. Noisy floor. I’ve stayed here a few times and loved it this time however I was so disappointed. More attention needs to be paid to the rooms.
50,Everyone was nice and my room was clean. Room was ready as soon as I got there. Bell desk gave me great tips and recommendations. Did almost everything online did not to wait in line. Got a seat quickly in all of their restaurants
50,Excellent service and very clean hotel and casino. Pools could use a little update but still nice area. Great restaurant choices. Overall a 9 as far as amenities and options. Good poker room. Room are great.
50,Went on a family trip with wife and kids. Had an awesome time at the pool. We walked the strip we got to eat at Eatly and the food was amazing. Definitely will be back here soon. Staff and everyone super friendly and helpful.
10,Overpriced paper thing walls a resort fee that covers nothing and no one complying with masks. I thought coming here at this point would make it better but somehow this was one of the worst stays I have had. And are the casinos hurting? Wouldn’t think so based on how they have raised prices on everything.
50,The staff are the friendliest I have encountered in Las Vegas - I nearly thought I was on a cruise ship they were so friendly! Excellent remodel to make the property smoke-free. The artwork is interesting and unique. La Pizza La Pasta is delicious (mushroom pasta dish). Eately is a cool concept but the service there was short-staffed. Only complaint is there is no place to buy bottled water or coffee after the one shop closes come prepared. Elevator and room hallways could use some attention and a regular vacuuming.
50,This was our first trip to LV since Covid hit. I have always hated that I had to walk through a smoke-filled casino to get to my non-smoking hotel room. Finally someone in LV has mustered the gonads to make the casino smoke-free as well! Loved it. Also the Park MGM is located only100 yards from the T-Mobile Arena so we were able to walk to the Vegas Golden Knights hockey game! No cab rides or parking hassle.
30,Hallways were dark almost made us feel like we were staying in a motel vs a strip hotel. Elevator was too crowded and it took us forever to get to our room. They needed staff to help direct people (which they did but they kept leaving and should have stayed during peak hours on the weekend.) Overall - It's and okay hotel and would stay here again only if it was free. Artwork food and shops were great. Hotel room average. Nothing was extremely standout when it came to staff friendliness or help either.
10,"We stay at a different hotel on the strip every time we visit Las Vegas. This was by far the worst resort we have stayed at. I booked this over a month ago through Vegas.com. When we arrived at almost 11 PM our room (king size) was not available. We either had to take another room or wait and there were 10 people in front of us. The lady that was checking us in told us that our reservation is not guaranteed only a request. They ""booked"" the room and charged my credit card for the reservation that to me is a guarantee! We were exhausted and took the room with two beds. They told us they would call us the next day when our room was ready but we never heard from anyone for our entire stay. The casino floor was small and half the machines were not working correctly. Most everything in the hotel was closed. We couldn't even get a cup of coffee. The only time we spent in our hotel was to sleep. We went to other hotels for EVERYTHING else! The ONLY good thing i can say about this resort was the water pressure and pillows."
50,verry helpful with directions. I locked myself out I got a key with no problem. I lost the bag they found it the bath could be a little more comfortable at least the cafe to eat all night food. Thank you
40,The casino was never super busy like the other places nearby which was nice. It was very clean and workers were friendly. Great location close to lots of other casinos. It would have been nice to know our players cards wouldn't work for the last part of our stay due to system maintenance. I spent a lot of money and didn't get any free play or comps.
30,the price was good i have no complaints about the room or hotel but it was super basic at best. it was clean and good at a low price point. I would only go back to this place at an exceptional price.
40,You won’t wake up with your mouth tasting like an ash tray here. The blackout curtains were perfect too!  You can probably steer clear of the pizza restaurant(not good at all) but the deserts in the Eataly are excellent.
50,Vegas is amazing. They strive so hard to make you forget what's happening in the real world. Park mgm Sayless is exceptional in every way. The only place I stay. The rooms are amazing and the customer experience is like nothing I've seen before. Thank you Park Mgm
30,Prime location on Strip. Starbucks closed all 4 days we were there. Most of Eataly closed including gelato Best Friend only open on weekend. Not many choices for kids. Had to go next door to New York New York.
30,Stay well amenities were nice but no fridge or microwave or end table or anything large enough to put clothes in wasn't good. We kept our clothes in the suitcase and dirty clothes on the floor. There was a couch and 1 chair 1 round table. Not enough space.
10,Paid for an upgrade to for a double queen suite in the NoMad tower of the Park MGM only to be very disappointed with a dirty room with pubic hairs in the bathroom and the bathroom sink constantly clogging up.
10,Our check in experience felt eternal even from the platinum line. My reservation was mishandled. We had to get new keys four times. Covid protocols were lousy. We go to Vegas a lot this is the worst service I’ve ever had anywhere including the stratosphere. Some
50,In town for beginning of NCAA March Madness - Very clean - friendly and overall exceptional stay. The location is perfect and not a very far walk to places on the strip. Pleasant table game dealers and never felt ignored.
50,The Park MGM has the app that allows you to check in and give you a digital key and allows you to check out. so if you dont feel like waiting in lines or interacting with people this hotel is right for you! beds are comfy and clean spacious and not overcrowded. and we arrived on a weekend so we were expecting craziness. will stay here again!
50,Non smoking new casino great! solid italian food court the rooms are a little dark but the location is awesome and so clean. we would stay again and we are in July. the pool area was also clean and staffed well as the whole hotel was
40,I really enjoyed staying at Park Mgm. I exceptionally enjoyed the stand alone shower and the smoke free environment at Park Mgm. Our bed was too firm for my liking. I wish there was some different type of food choices but it's conveniently located next to NY NY. I would definitely stay again at Park Mgm
40,Loved the location of the hotel close to everything. Service was great. Room was good. Wish more dining options were open. Too cold to try the pool but it looked nice. Would stay again in the future.
50,First thing I want to say they are smoke free now and I do smoke I just went out side to smoke and YES I would like for it to go back to smoking but the rooms are updated not that I spend much time in the room! The bed are comfortable and the rooms are clean!
50,Everything was great except the BetMGM was asking a ridiculous amount of money just to sit your butt in a seat for the NCAA basketball tourny. We spent our money elsewhere because of this greed. I was hoping bc of the pandemic Vegas had lost some of its greed and put customers first like it used to but it still showed up in this instance.
30,Pool was not available for us to enjoy the sunshine during the day!  Lines at the cashier were frustrating.  Suggestion: have a window for the people who are cashing out their 401k!  Have a chips only window a ailbke !
50,We took a family vacation our first since COViD hit us worldwide in March 2020. We were skeptical in staying at a hotel but Park MGM assured us that our rooms (Stay Well) rooms had air purifiers and other amenities we will enjoy. The beds were comfortable and really enjoyed our stay. We definitely will find time later to stay at this establishment.
50,The room was super cute and modern. The hotel is smoke free which I liked. I was able to check in and out on the app so I didn’t have to wait in any lines. The lady that helped me at the sports book was very nice and helpful although I have forgotten her name.
20,we didn’t get to relax when we got to our room. They moved us 4 times. By the 4th time we were looking for other alternatives but they had us move up a few floors. This seemed like an upgrade but it wasn’t. We had the same room but a longer elevator ride. They offered a $75 credit but I practically Had to beg to get that. maybe I set The standard too high after staying at other hotels but I dont Think a clean room with functional window shades/ not stained towels is too much to ask.
50,We love it here. The beds are comfy. The shower is huge. Rooms are big and the couch is great to look out the window and relax. The front desk lady was nice. We had a mini fridge brought up to us and it was quick . Just wish there was no masks lol
30,Personally loved the 100% smoke free but room wasn't clean stained comforter dirty sink and soup dish sink that didn't drain well awful customer service staff that gave us attitude. Overall disappointed experience.
30,Park MGM was an OK experience. It was too far south for my liking. I paid extra for the strip view but my view was the side of Waldorf Astoria. If I knew that is what I would be looking at I wouldn't have spent the extra $$.
20,Reserved 2 king bed rooms only to arrive and be given 2 queen rooms. Was put on a supposed text waitlist to let us know when rooms would become available that is a sham because people arriving were still giving rooms before us. Waited for over 4 hours and never got any texts. Planned a birthday trip for my dad hoping to get connecting rooms or at least same floor. No such luck. This is your 1st impression and it wasn't a good one for us. And sadly this is the 2nd time our experience has been bad here figured the 1st time was a mistake. But realizing this is just how they run things at check in which is too bad because everything after checking in is great. Still won't be returning.
30,MLife booking offered a upgrade to a strip view room got a back of the building freeway view. Not quite the same. The restaurants very limited  has to go across the street for coffee in the morning
30,They booked our room to a couple while we my partner and I were sleeping. Didn’t get a apology from the front desk or anything. Tried calling the front to advise what what happened and didn’t get a response until we went down and talked to them
50,The entrance is nicely located in the back to avoid the strips crowd. Great restaurant choices and EATELY is a HIT. The balance is key access to all the great things the strips has to offer yet provides the ability to ga away from all of it when needed.
10,No food open after 10pm. Plus no dresser in room & inadequate closet as it’s filled with things where you need to hang up clothes. Staff was unwilling to help find a new room. Even when I offered to pay.
50,Great hotel excellent value. Beautiful decor and ambiance. Definitely my new go to in Vegas. Looking forward to coming back once Lady Gaga’s residency is back on. Thank you Park MGM for the wonderful stay.
40,Hotel was very nice. Clean. Perfect spot with access to everything. The smoke free environment is great! Check in and out was very easy on the app. Eatery area shuts down pretty early but believe this is due to Covid.
40,Just needed more customer service by the waitress in the casino. We played several hours in the slots and waitresses would ignore us. We would ask for a drink and they would say sorry it's not my areas
50,This was a great location and the service was great! The room was clean and had a nice view of the strip. Everyone was professional and helpful. Overall experience was great! I would come back here again.
30,My hotel room smell like someone took a dump before I was there. Room need a major renovation . The only thing great about Park MGM was Eataly . Pizza joint was amazing. Getting a taxi at MGM was a major headache but the staff did what they could to helpbout.
50,I really enjoyed myself perfect location everything right in a block area staff very friendly easy check in better checkout will not be upset you picked the Park MGM as your place to stay and ooooo did I mention the Security they have very safe
10,I used to come here when it was Monte Carlo and it was so fun for myself and my kids. Great gambling and pool time. Now it’s a racist adult only culture in the pool. Don’t go here if you’re a minority or have a family. They treat minorities like if we stole something from them and only in room dining and the pool area food is good for families. The pool manager is racist and harasses you if you have kids in her pools. They have a lot of unwritten rules like no splashing no jumping no water games no swimming and no speakers of any kind even if just your phone is on with music. The most awful experience of my life. And I have been going to Vegas with my children for 15 years straight. I love Vegas still and every other hotel except for this one. Should be advertised as white adults only.
50,Love all MGM hotels... this has great rooms service atmosphere. The art work is amazing! Staff was friendly.. enjoyed the gaming and the food. Smoke free hotel and casino. Check in and out was simple
50,A friendly staff is easily found throughout the hotel to answer/help with anything you might have questions about. The room was very clean and comfortable. It is also one of the only hotels where you can get room service. Overall great experience will rebook on my next staycation thank you.
50,There were a good selection of fun slots with a variety of denominations. Variety of food venues were limited due to COVID closures but the quality of offerings were good. The Stay Well rooms are comfortable and quiet.
50,Would stay here again great stay great location on the strip superb! I would recommend to anyone going to vegas. Smoke free is the way to go rooms were comfortable and stylish..also super clean!!!
40,Love the no smoking. Rooms were great. Lots of good food nearby. Easy check in process. Find Lilly at the blackjack tables. She was the best. Poor drink service in the casino. Aside from that the trip was great.
30,The check in and out lines and out of control and luckily Vegas still is t busy. Dealers were the most unfriendly I have experience in my 30yrs of going to Vegas. Hotel is ok but nothing special and I won’t be going back. Monte Carlo was a much better experience pre buyout.
50,Dealers very friendly and helpful for a beginner player. The casino and hotel is non-smoking so it made the experience very clean. Check in was convenient via my phone’s MGM app. Check out through the TV in my room. I would definitely return.
30,Was kind of bummed out how bland the room was. The sink in our room was clogged water went down very slow. The shower was great though high pressure water. The strip view was more of a parking lot and roof top view.
40,We loved the smoke free atmosphere. We stayed here years ago when it e as tree Monte Carlo this is a HUGE upgrade. Highly recommend staying here especially if your going to an event at the T Mobile Arena which is right next door!!
50,Great location on the strip with a smoke free environment. Had a lot of fun with the dealers at the tables breakfast at Primrose that felt more like a bed a breakfast and a steak dinner at Bavette’s that we just can’t get back home. Have fun!
50,I went to Vegas for the first time to get married and my experience was not the greatest but it wasn't because of Park MGM. I would only go back because of my stay there. I just hate that I didn't get the opportunity to go to the pool because of other issues.
50,the Park MGM is located within walking distance of so many casinos on the strip. We like that it's not so huge like many of the other hotels... getting off the elevator and to the strip takes no time at all.  The rooms are all recently renovated and are always clean and nice.
50,Great place great location loved the fact it’s connected to the aria great food options great staff! very neat and clean definitely coming back. 10+ rating all around! For sure! Street view was great on the 19th floor!
40,Love the location the staff and having Eataly right down stairs. Since our stay was five days I would have appreciated a better flow in the room. Our room was quiet and was easy to access. Enjoyed our stay!
10,I this hotel felt like a remodeled super 8 motel. It was clean but rooms are small and plain. Did not feel like Vegas. But close to other fun places. For the same money I would try something else. But the smoke free environment was nice!
50,I stayed here with the bride to be for a bachelorette/ wedding party. We booked a nightingale suite which was upgraded to the nomad suite! From the moment we got out of the car we were treated with exceptional service. Highly recommend and will be back!
50,We had a awesome visit. Fast check in via the app. and fast check out. Place was beautiful and clean. We cannot wait to come back!  The bed was like sleeping on clouds. We had just come off a work trip and staying here the extra 3 days was well spent!
10,This review will be a complaint. Travel is tough right now and one would think that hotels and resorts would be working hard to build customer loyalty and satisfaction. Well... not so much at the Park MGM. Two complaints. First... pool service. Not existent. Spent day at pool since the pool at my MGM property was closed. Fair enough. I walked the short distance to the Park MGM. Crowded. Sun was nice. Music was good. Over the top attention to enforcing mask rules— plenty of attention by security with that. No attention to pool service. Selective attention was given to some guests and no attention was given to others. I was in the latter group. I wanted a beverage and lunch. Two hours of waiting waving and calling for a server. Nope. Overlooked and ignored. Literally. Wow. Disappointing and not good.
30,Very happy to see Las Vegas reopening. Although services and attractions are limited the Las Vegas experience remains. Restaurants and shopping are still the best. The Park MGM is doing great job managing and handling safety protocols!
50,The staff at the Park MGM are very friendly and helpful! We like to stay here whenever we are on the strip..although we do look for a good deal. The rooms are a bit small but they are very cute. We wish Park MGM the best.
40,Not many things open during our stay. I’m sure that was due to covid though. Room was extremely warm and we had to turn in a ticket to get it resolved. They set the room temp to a max low of 65 unless you call them to reprogram the thermostat
50,Property provides a great location with easy access to the Strip. Staff was relaxed friendly and helpful. Check-in was painless. The room was clean and welcoming. Ample amenities and extra services were available.
10,"A lot more cleaner rooms and way nicer staff. I had a good view and very comfortable bed. But in Vegas I don't really even get to sleep so even though the bed was great it wasn't my whole stay. My family and friends stayed at treasure island and we were able to play there and chill with our fam and the staff was everywhere and so much nicer I can tell most were overwhelmed but I don't blame them because covid sucks. But they still did their best unlike the rude staff here at PARK MGM. Sadly this hotel is sooooo beautiful and the casino and the eatery is nice I love the whole itally look. But if you're someone like me who cares about how people are and are huge in customer service This ishhh would really P you off. I would ask for help simply like ""Where is the bathroom?"" They won't speak they'll just point and not even detail their direction Like I'm supposed to just walk there and figure it out. I have $800 in my machine and I barely seen any waiters passing by me for drinks so I went and tipped at the Bellagio bc even if their so snobby the moment I pull out a tip they know to do their job and return. When I smile your women staff literally roll their eyes at me. Ive easily spent $3k that night just because I wanted to have fun and gamble since it was such a spontaneous trip and Park MGMs team makes me never want to stay at their hotel. The cleanliness as well bugged me. There was a piece of gum stuck on the bathroom floor behind the door and I had to pick it up or else I'd be stepping on it every time I got up to use the restroom. Regardless my stay was terrible and I came here two years ago and enjoyed my stay. But as much as COVID19 blows most of the other hotels and casinos weren't as bad as this one. but I'll tell you the price was very decent. this was the cheapest option but pay the extra $20 to go somewhere else. Hope this helps some of you guys out! :)"
50,Excellent location clean not congested best trip I have had to Vegas. Primrose was great for breakfast but you have got to try the Crack Shack they have amazing sandwiches!! Overall great visit and will definitely be back.
40,"""No phone No lights No motor car not a single luxury. Like Robinson Crusoe It's primitive as can be."" well actually it's not that bad. HoweverNo clock No coffee makerno refrigerator. Resort Fee?"
50,From check in to check out superb service. Clean motel comfy bed non smoking quiet. Connecting rooms for families. Great location. Would definitely recommend and stay here again. Good dining choices. A+
40,Did I mention that the entire resort is non-smoking?! :) Guest rooms are a good size and very clean. The bathrooms are awkward and have no place to store/hang towels except for a couple of wall hooks that don't let them dry properly. They don't offer roll away beds which is an issue for us because we prefer to get a king bed (we're used to sleeping in one at home and it's too hard to go to a queen even for a short time) which left no bed for our son except for the window seat/couch which isn't very comfortable. Overall it was a great place to stay and we will definitely stay there again.
50,Loved the stay I need to go back & have fun & I love the free play! Love it! The stay was nice & makes me want to go back & have fun and spend more time in Vegas!!! Food gambling & the Entertainment was great.
50,Loveed the smoke free casino and rooms! Good eateries and many more options with so many casinos easily in walking distance. Rooms are nice. Shower was amazing. I would definitely stay here again. Smoke Free!
50,What an excellent experience overall - I have asthma and we found that the Park MGM is a smoke-free casino. Truly a breath of fresh air to be able to gamble eat enjoy our time in a casino and not go to bed smelling of smoke and waking up with lungs that ache and coughing that doesn't stop for an entire day. If you would like a break from all of the dope heads and cigarette smoke this is the place for you. Not to mention that the Italian food center is delicious and wonderful and truly authentic. Something that you do not want to miss if you enjoy Italian food.
50,It’s a very easy check in experience. It’s straight forward but I always have an issue on the app on adding a guest for the room key. But I love their blackout curtains so you are able to sleep in with no problem. I highly recommend staying here. I will continue staying here because of the rooms plus great location on the strip!
50,I chose the Park MGM because it was non-smoking which is how all of the casinos are here in Colorado. When I got to the room I knew I made the right decision! The room is very spacious and comfortable beautiful shower but when I laid down on the bed...OMG! This was the most comfortable bed I have EVER slept in! Even just lounging in it was enough to not mind that I didn't have all that much to gamble with everyday. I even asked them at the desk what it was they said they'd email it to me. The casino itself is much larger that I thought when I looked at the resort map and again non-smoking which is bliss! My only complaint would be not enough restaurants open and nothing 24 hrs. There are many food options close so it was ok. Other than that it was an amazing stay and I will definitely stay there again.
30,Room 316 on lvl 14 has a nice view of the arena next door. The shower barely had any warm water. Love the smoke free casino and dining options. Bavette’s has some amazing food. The casino is small but sufficient; not overly crammed with machines.
30,The rooms were nicely done. The air conditioner barely works and the walls are thin so you can hear the neighbors talking.however the staff was very polite and helpful. If it weren’t for the 2 issues I had mentioned it would have been a perfect stay. Also this resort is a non smoking resort. I’d suggest if you’re a smoker and don’t want to walk all the way out side to smoke stay elsewhere.
20,First room had broken AC. Was moved to a second room where we found someone else’s socks in the corner. GROSS! Rooms are small and dark. Location is decent. Be prepared to wait 35+ minutes for coffee in the morning because only one place is open.
50,Have stayed here several times and will stay again in the future. It's convenient for everything we like to do central to restaurants we frequent reasonably priced for a good location on the strip and best of all 100% smoke free throughout the property.
50,Some of the best food around. Friendly staff gorgeously decorated and spacious rooms. Very clean fun and so lively definitely one of the best places to stay. This is going to be my Vegas destination from now on.
50,Newly remodeled. Very clean. Beds are fantastic. Slept so good. I love that it’s a no smoking hotels. My rooms smelled good. Parking is easy. I liked where it was located. Amazing Gelato right in the hotel.
50,Had so much fun staying at Park loved the room the service & food we ordered to our room was delicious!! Would definitely stay here again can’t wait to come back & do it all again. 10 out of 10 ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
50,Renovated facility awesome spots to eat (though expensive as Vegas always is...) but a great spot to put up roots for your stay. We went during covidmageddon so lots of spots weren't open (starbucks smaller stores etc) but that's to be expected. Great spot for walking distance to other casinos top golf the strip t mobile arena and can't wait until park theatre is open again! The regular rooms do NOT have fridges in them which sucked. But we improvised with ice and coolers made the best of it. Definitely a great spot to check out if you haven't been there. Casino was clean SMOKE FREE!!! and service was top notch. Ate at La Pizza La Pasta killer food! Wanted to hit the steak house but didn't have a chance while we there due to the schedule we had. Will be back!
30,Nice property & location (convenient to both Aria & NYNY) - rooms have almost no closet space but adequate amenities. If you can get a great rate or Comp’d room it’s definitely a viable option. Clean air/smell throughout.
50,If you don’t like cigarette smoke while you spend your hard earned money at the slot machine or table games and you love an awesome hotel room. This hotel is for you. The best MGM property on the strip.
10,What a shame  it was a great idea having a Non-smoking hotel and casino  being that second had smoke is almost as bad as smoking ! We live in Las Vegas and go to many hotels  we were so excited to find a Non-smoking one . The rooms are nothing to talk about and the beds are terrible. When we went up to the room my wife sat on the bed and asked me to try it . You could feel the springs . The casino was small with very few tables and we could not get a spot on one  Roulette  3 card poker  etc ... We decided to leave when we told the front desk that could care less ! We have a a line of credit there which I will be closing . Being a MGM property I would have expected better .
50,This hotel is like family and a second home. Down to the staff and bartender and casino host and cocktail servers. Amazing y'all are doing good job and I thank you all for the best service and stay. Xoxox
30,Overall the hotel stay was not worth the value the decor felt aged. The staff was not overly friendly the ones that did see my ID didn’t acknowledge my birthday. The amenities in the room were lack luster where I spent my downtime.
30,Great deal especially as an m life rewards members  can’t beat that . Nice rooms very subtle and dull. Great location on the strip and lots of nice places to eat at the casino floor and surrounding areas
50,Of all the hotels we could have chosen to stay on the strip I’m so glad we chose Park MGM. Especially for the price. Great stay. Would stay there again.The app made the check in process so quick. Drop the bags and head out for a night on the town.
40,Overall the Park MGM was really great to stay at. We had friends at the Aria and the walkway was a great 8-10 minute walk to them. The check in was fast too. All staff was great. We had a Stay Well room and the bed was firm. A little too firm for me.
50,I love this place! If you like a smoke-free centrally located clean and elegant place to stay with comfortable beds and pillows - this is the BEST place.  Can't wait for Cher to come back to perform!
50,Great location! King room was very spacious and clean and comfortable. We had breakfast in the Primrose which was fabulous. The atmosphere light and airy our server was very accommodating and the Hollandaise on the Eggs Benedict some of the best I've ever had.
50,This place is conveniently located in the middle of Aria and new york new york. The staff is wonderful and looking forward to the rest of the restaurants opening up at normal times in the future. Laura is a 5 star class example of attentiveness and is very helpful. Will stay again.
50,This hotel and casino has a great location! It’s very central to both sides of the strip. One of the main bonuses is that it’s all smoke free in the casino and hotel in general! Makes it’s way more enjoyable to gamble and not have to get 2nd hand smoke! The pool is also open!
50,We so enjoyed our stay. No smoke in the rooms casino or restaurant areas. Staff was amazingly friendly and the food was wonderful. Try the bakery items - to DIE for!! Rooms were clean and comfortable. We will go back frequently to this specific casino.
50,Pleasant atmosphere free from smoke. Very clean rooms and casino.Good choice of restaurants with Eataly. Close to NY NY and other casinos I usually don't go to. Would come back if offered comp room again.
50,Park MGM is clean and strive for cautious fun. As I drove through Vegas majority of people were wearing mask and or not right. Checking into Park MGM was different people gloves mask and hand sanitizer dispensers. It doesn't have that fabreeze trying to cover up cigarette smell since a smoke free resort. Wash station in the casino new food places. Cant wait to come back and fully enjoy it.
50,Park MGM Las Vegas is a great hotel for you and your family. I don’t have a single bad comment to say about my stay here. The staff was very friendly and met my every need. I will definitely come back to this hotel.
50,It was great having a smoke free casino. The staff were all helpful and friendly. The breakfast room service was lovely and quicker than going down. The location is perfect for about anything you want to do. Since the Hard Rock Hotel closed this has been our go to Vegas hotel and we are very pleased with it.
30,I have stayed here a few times and never had a problem this last time the room was a little dirty but other than that no problems. I didn’t want to complain so I just tried to clean it up my self. The hotel is nice and clean.
50,Had a comfortable stay with a nice room and a great staff. Convenient location on the strip . Used the Deuce to go wherever we wanted. Would very likely consider staying here in the near future. Great Vegas hotel!
40,The cleanliness was exceptional. Definitely a breath of fresh air that this casino/hotel is smoke free. I loved the ambiance and the relaxed feel if this place. I will be staying here again and other MGM properties.
40,We had a good trip...the steakhouse was good the check in experience was great..    The only issue was the lines to get coffee with no Starbucks available    The eatealy otherwise was very good and so was the juniper lounge
50,Had to get away for a little while and picked the Park MGM thanks to the MLife Rewards App. The best decision I made for this trip! Very clean room soft bed great view and a wonderful staff! The Front Desk Staff was friendly and helpful and an ever present Security staff was the cherry on top! Would definitely recommend and stay again!
50,Staying at the Park MGM has always been our #1 choice when visiting Vegas. We are from Hawaii and enjoy the friendly staff the quick request for housekeeping who provided excellent service! I recommend Park MGM to anyone who will visit Vegas!
50,Very family oriented  Can’t wait to come  Back  Security was friendly staff we’re very helpful I can’t wait to come back and bring my daughters I wish i knew about this hotel before the no smoking policy is very excellent
40,We reserved 2 rooms for 3 nights. Arrived just after 4p on Friday and got checked in pretty fast. The front desk staff was very nice! They even had the request in for adjoining rooms. The rooms were clean and fairly good size not that you are in there much. There was a very slow drain in the sink in one of the rooms. We called on that Saturday morning and someone showed up in 20 minutes and got that fixed.  We went to MLIFE to cash in our rewards from My Vegas got those attached to our cards and a blackjack match play coupon.  Saturday morning we went to play match play on BJ and they advised we had to use the same night as we got the coupon but they would reissue us both new ones.  Went back to MLIFE desk and they did just that. OK this is were it went down hill at MLIFE. Somehow when they swiped our cards probably to void the match play so they could reissue us coupons they actually deleted my friends FREEPLAY in the process on her card. Anyway she went back there to let them know and got a very rude lady that said she used her credits Friday night. Well she couldn't have since she never played any slot machines or any games for that matter on Friday night. But why argue on something we could never prove but it was BS as we have no doubt when the guy erased the match play that somehow the other credit was deleted as well by accident.  I did like the fact the casino is smoke free but since the legalization of pot the strip just smells nasty. I mean before you could occasionally smell it while out walking but now it just stinks.  Overall it was a good stay despite the rude lady Saturday morning at Mlife. I didn't want to rate the overall stay lower due to one bad apple since the other staff was very nice.
50,My trip started out rough because of my missed slot tournament but the staff made it special. They checked on me a few times and made sure I knew of benefits that I wasn’t using. Also very clean room and smoke free.
50,The Park MGM is a smoke free resort that lives up to the billing. I am very sensitive to smoke and did encounter individuals pushing the rules in the lobby rest rooms or on the gambling floor Not even the cape pens.
30,Great location. But No hot water for showers at night. I don’t know if the hotel is just trying to save money but every night the hot water would stop. Clean room. A lot of things close by 10pm. Free parking is great.
30,Casino was crowded disappointing variety of Slots Parking was packed Vaping was present Lost lots of money with Slots Room was no frills without a fridge paper thin walls with adjoining room and the food was scarce weird and also costly.
50,Check in was a breeze the rooms are very clean spacious & quiet which I need because of how late we like to stay out. The staff is great at taking care of your requests. The casino is smoke free which was great!
50,First time stay for a weekend getaway. Great service from the moment we walked in. Clean rooms and casino at a great price. Hallways could use new carpet and brighter lighting. Family friendly - smoke free. The property is tucked away on the strip across the street from the hustle and bustle yet in proximity to the center of the strip for shopping. Target CVS Walgreens and Ross are conveniently located across the street. Would recommend staying here if you have kids or want to stay out of the busy strip activities but still want to be close to everything.
50,The rates were good. The rooms clean and very nice. Check in and check out easy. We enjoyed the atmosphere. We felt very safe with the COVID precautions being taken. We like the location of the hotel on the strip.
50,The rooms are clean and really nice. A decent view of the strip. The staff was really nice and helpful Close to everything. Great corona virus prevention protocol. Mask and hand sanitizer available in every lobby.
50,My room was clean comfy and cozy. The food was outstanding and the location is excellent. Staff was super friendly and helpful. I will definitely be back in the near future. I really enjoyed my stay.
40,Booked direct on MGM website as an Mlife member. I paid 40 bucks for an early check-in. We arrived and had asked for adjoining rooms. Tanisha at the front desk totally helped us out getting that arranged. We had stayed here a few times when it was the Monte Carlo. It has undergone a complete renovation and the rooms are updated. Comfortable beds and true black out shades. Bathroom shower had good pressure bath products and plenty of towels. There is a safe in the closet and a small dresser. Outlets on the night stand for phone charging and plenty of outlets around the room. The best thing for me was the non smoking throughout the resort. No weed wafting down the corridors although many people still stunk of weed it is unlike the clientele of late at the MGM Grand. This hotel is a clear choice if smoke in any form bothers you.
20,Beware of cheap prices..this hotel is not fully operational most restaurants are still closed. Hallways and rooms are dark and you will most likely have no view if booked online. Finally slots are tighter than tight and tables are too!
50,Highly recommend park MGM  very clean rooms with comfy bed and comfy pillows. No noisy neighbors. Hotel is located in the middle so you have many restaurants and bars walking distance you don’t have to walk far
50,I have always enjoy staying at the Park MGM. Staff is always friendly and always with a smile... I will definitely let my friends and family know about this place. Next I will try the Italian restaurants onsite and I will also try their onsite steak house. Can wait for my next business trip...
50,Right next to T-Mobile arena and NYNY. Loved the non smoking aspect. Was the best feature in our opinion. Italian themed restaurants were great. Food was delicious and desserts yummy. Contactless check-in on your phone...electronic key using phone...all great features. Would definitely stay here again.
50,Great rooms amazing options for food and CANNot wait to go back and see haus of Gaga and eat at best friends and the stairway! I did NoT miss the smoke it at this hotel casino. This place was amazing and I will be back
50,We loved our stay at ParkMGM. They have made the best of not being able to have entertainment in the venues. There was a live band on the casino floor the bars were super nice and the floor was clean. Machines were being wiped down and security was on it with ensuring everyone wore a mask.
30,Expect very little in terms of luxury or extras. Bed desk nightstand and dirty couches and chairs await you. 2 towels no bag for ice broken window shades and flat pillows. Minimal options for meals.
50,"The hotel itself is nice and pretty. Nonsmoking which is great! But the rooms are super small and have nothing special about them. We got a ""strip view"" but there isn't really a strip view. Its not worth paying more than a regular room. But the rooms are really small that we ended up upgrading to a suite just so we didn't feel like we were in a box. The suite was really nice It really saved the trip. Beds are extremely comfortable and the shower water pressure was amazing!"
30,The digital check-in was weird. We stayed for 3 nights and had zero contact with any of the staff. It was surreal. Skip the digital key. No phone reception in the elevator and you need the digital key to operate the elevator. I had to remember to pull up the key on my phone as I was approaching the elevator. Next time I'll opt for an in-person check-in and a key card.
30,Hotel manager did give us a restaurant comp due to the room inconvenience but given the Covid circumstances I feel it should have been handled differently. My boyfriend has asthma so we were worried after this and the air quality in the room we were in made his breathing even worse which worried us even more. Wasn’t sure if it was from entering a dirty room or just poor air. This was the first getaway we were able to take in almost 2 years and wish it could have been a little better.
30,This was a very nice hotel staff was helpful before check-in. Great places to eat with in the hotel. Room had a beautiful view of Vegas. But so disappointed on the cleanliness. Bathroom wasn’t that clean.
50,We are part of the Mlife and received a Wonder offer. This was our second stay. The property is updated clean smoke free and has great ambiance. Loved the eataly food court. Good location. Staff were very helpful.
50,My experience staying at Park MGM was amazing great location restaurants bars by the strip. Room was clean casino tables and slots are great. Restrooms are clean. We overall had a great time there.
20,The property has been renovated slightly in certain areas of the casino floor. The rooms are still the same thin walls you can hear your neighbors conversations if you don’t have the tv on. Most of all BEWARE OF THE DEPOSIT REQUIREMENTS. This property requires 100 per ea night (10 night stay $1000 deposit) most resorts do a 1 time 1 charge deposit.
50,The hotel was clean and above my expectations. I asked the housekeeper if she could make the beds and give us clean towels and it was done when we returned to the room not that long after. Is definitely stay here again.
30,Nice place but could be cleaner especially during times like this. You can’t enter your hotel room without having your key which I think is pretty cool. The staff were overall nice. I do love the fact that it is a non smoking casino. Didn’t try of the restaurants.
20,Beautiful room incredible views. Very disappointed in the lack of refrigeration. It was nice that it was smoke free. Did not like that we were not told once we checked out online we would not be able to access the room anymore. I checked out with my phone as I was bringing luggage to my car and was locked out when I returned for the rest of my luggage. Don’t mind that that is the practice just wish we were told. The floor we were on was not clean. The entire time we were there the same trash was on the floor by the elevators. We did not receive nor were we offered cleaning services the second day. Not really sure if I would return.
50,Awesome location. Room was perfect. Guest services were very helpful. Will definitely stay here again. Location was perfect distance from everything on strip. nice casino friendly staff. Even won some money. Eataly was great n very good food.
20,Even though park mgm is a newly remodeled casino replacing the monte carlo staying there is not the mgm experience we were expecting. The lobbies are dark the carpets look old and grimey and the general ambience is not so great either. The people working at least are kind and friendly even though some mistakes were made in charges that required us calling the front desk after checking out to have resolved. The rooms are also extremely bare bones there is no furniture at all aside from a table and one chair which is odd as there should be a dresser we asked the front desk about this who said they took furniture out of our room because of covid and guests complained about it.
50,Super great staff clean rooms. eataly is great. Non smoking so no cough or eye irritation playing in casino. Everything in room clean and worked fine. Use key for elevator for security. Not all restaurants are open
40,Has the vibe of the old Monte Carlo. I imagine it would of been a much better experience if the tram was open. The suite we had was large the beds comfortable! The shower was just meh. Tough to get a great shower experience on Vegas strip from what I’ve seen. No pressure. I will be back again ! Thanks. Sean CHARLESTON SC
50,Clean and smoke free property with friendly staff willing to help you from check in to check out. Casino had friendly dealers and drink service was prompt and accurate. Will definitely be staying here again soon.
30,I will like to chalk it up to COVID this was not the best trip I have had at Park MGM. I hope for better results in the future. Typically a very clean and awesome hotel experience. Food was not at it's usual standard. I was charge for a room I was supposed to be only charged the resort fees. Primrose is my favorite breakfast spot in Vegas. The Valentines Day Menu was not good. Food was undercooked and for $39 per person you would think they would add in coffee.
20,The hotel itself was nice but I’ll give two stars however buyer beware. The resort fees are outrageous and will fluctuate from day today. They will tell you one rate and then when you go to check out they will switch the rate on you and you won’t even know it until you look at your bank account and find out they charge $44 per day for nothing resort related. Scam! Make sure you get a printed receipt upon checkout so that there are no surprises when you look at your bank account.
50,The resort is very clean and minus the typical smoking smell you associate with Vegas. The room was amazing with modern amenities. It was a great stay and will do it again. Even gave complimentary masks.
20,Planned a lovely weekend for the wife booked in advance to make sure I was able to have a room.. booked what said to be a beautiful room with view  tub  king bed .. only for wife to walk in and turn and laugh and say  we sleeping in different beds tonight I guess ..... my jaw dropped completely different room !! Hotel still charged me full amount that I booked for but instead of the room I thought I was getting got a two beds no view no tub and guest services told me they don’t guarantee the room which makes no sense what’s the point of booking then !! Not only that but they ran out I guess and they don’t notify you prior they just let you be embarrassed in front of your significant other and still charge you full pop... happy valentines 2021 ha joke . Also need to fix where address leaves you because google took us to the back of the hotel in an alley .
50,MGM Park was a great value and wonderful experience. The Hotel is very centrally located. The casino was great and we love the non smoking experience. Staff was very helpful and friendly lots of great food options at the hotel and nearby properties.
50,We were able to access the Mobil check in. It had asked for our estimated arrival time. We were notified that our room was available before the 3pm check in. This was a life saver since we arrived at 11am. The digital key was the best part. We did not have to wait in line nor worry about us loosing or leaving a key behind.
50,Non-smoking casino and hotel was a breath of freshness. Excellent central location easy walking distances to many of the Las Vegas Blvd attractions. Food selections were great live band playing on the casino floor was great. Parking can be limited on weekends but overall a highly recommended hotel.
30,I was looking for a little getaway for the weekend for relaxation but did not get that.  The room was not up to my standards. It was dusty and bathroom was not all that clean. They also have a bunch of hidden fees not listed if you use the mobile check in app.
40,This is an awesome resort. It’s the second time bing here and we move the fact it’s smoke free and the service is top notch. Our only minor issue is we wish there were more options for food at the resort but all in all love it!!
50,Location good. Clean room clean bathroom comfy room. Pretty great. Food was cool. Nice secret passage to aria. Loved that it was non smoking casino. Easy to access the other side of the street from the walkways
50,We used the mobile app for check-in. The process could not have been easier. We used the mobile app key and avoided any front desk lines. What could be better than that!! Every staff encounter was pleasurable. Very difficult to achieve during these pandemic times. The casino was clean and safe. I will definitely be back soon.
30,Having worked in the hotel/tourist industry cleanliness was what I'd expect out of motel 6. Not a strip hotel. For as slow as they are it's really unacceptable. Only saving grace was friendly staff and decent meal selections.
50,Great rooms great service love everything about the casino great dealers waitress check in and check out service. Didn't win but I didn't struggle to for service tables were available for a busy day for being a holiday weekend.
50,Love Park MGM Its clean not too big easy to get around. The rooms are very comfortable and the set up gives you more space. There's a couch across where the window is and the lighting is good throughout. Staff was friendly and nice. Eataly out front is soooo good! Stayed here February 11-13 had a great time! Planning to go back in May Can't wait!!
30,The only thing that I didn’t like was that my room wasn’t what I wanted or expected. Other than that we enjoyed the time we doesn’t and on-site staff was the best. Food was great and enjoyed the pool. I would definitely visit again if they get my room right.
40,Perfect location is a smoke free property. Calm newer location. Property and rooms are clean and newer. Staff ok not the greatest in my personal experience. I booked a regular king size room. When arrived they assigned me a handicap king size room. And would not change it to a regular bomber
40,Clean  nice place ! A few more options for quick food place would be perfect. Rooms ok and safety felt good ! Casino floor great but huge table games good but lower price tables would be nice IMO . Overall very good !
20,I ran into a variety of issues with room upkeep to amenities. Perhaps just a bad showing by the hotel but enough to merit caution going forward. This could be covid related as they do not have guests stay during the week but in any case unacceptable.
30,Went for superbowl sunday couldn’t bet on the game. Only reason we went to vegas was to bet. Machines crashed app crashed and was not comped at all for anything. It was a waste of a trip since we go to bet on games
50,Very nice property and a super plus that it was smoke free. All other casinos we went to smelled of Marijuana and smoke. Cheap Marijuana too so was not pleasant at all. Will definitely be staying at the park mgm next time around.
50,Love the hotel Loved the rooms nicely decorated truly blackout curtains convenient location. Helpful staff. there are a lot of restaurants choices around this hotel. great location if you like to walk to other hotels.
50,Had a great time. Rarely disappointed in the hotel because of the value and convenient location of the hotel. Unfortunately the casino wasnt as kind to me this year but that's the way it goes. Vegas was different this year because of covid but never felt unsafe. Looking forward to normalcy next year.
50,Everything was perfect at this hotel and everyone was friendly and hospitable. This is a NO SMOKING hotel which was awesome will be back just for that reason alone. Room was great and very clean. Not a problem one. Go stay and have some fun and relaxation.
50,Room service should be available 24 hours a 7 days a week and have more food on the menu what i ordered was good and had enough sauce on it and it was right on time and i will be back soon with more people
40,Our stay at the mgm park for super bowl weekend was fabulous. I love the fact they are a nonsmoking facility. Wish they had more food options but overall it was great!!! We would stay there again for sure
50,Nice play to stay during covid. The no smoking policy was a nice surprise. The hotel unfortunately only had half of its restaurants opened but the stay was still enjoyable. The location is in perfect for access to the arena for hockey or concerts.
40,Best feature if this hotel in that it’s nonsmoking! But the attention to detail from the staff is amazing. We had a great experience from check-in to dining to the specialty drinks at the cool bar to the online checkout! The only down side is no coffee bottled water and fridge in the room. Amazingly clean as well!
40,Overall it was a very good weekend to be in Vegas for the big game. People were great hotel staff and Casino floor staff were fantastic! Love The Park!! I wish there was a 24 hour coffee shop but not a big deal.
50,It was amazing great food great service and no smell like cigarette very clean in and out I would totally stay there again and also easy to check in and out i can say I will go back to it on my next trip
50,"Non smoking adult only casino. Rooms were very nice high tech casino with room keys on your phone easy to check in. Quiet casino super comfortable beds. NoMad is a higher end area that has high limit casino room and awesome restaurant/bar that has a ""speakeasy"" feel to it. Delicious menu. Eately food court is phenomenal with different counters to order wine dessert dinner snacks etc. Love the location on this as well. T-Mobile Arena next door and shopping across the street."
50,The Park MGM was clean and well maintained. The beds were comfortable. The room was very clean. The entire hotel and casino are smoke free. The employees were friendly. There were several security guards throughout the hotel and casino to ensure your safety.
50,I loved my room and the decor especially. I was nice and classy. I wish the WIFI worked in my room and I wasn’t able to access room service for food because the QR code wasn’t working. I would definitely come back and stay again!
30,First time staying at this place and last time manager was rude and felt like a criminal during my stay. I was followed by staff one night thinking I was a criminal and felt un welcomed and not wanted in the area.
10,First they charge you without knowing and not only that but they don’t fulfill the offer booked and overcharge me for my stay along with a dirty sheets on the beds and water building up in the shower. You better off staying some where else
50,If it’s one thing I was worried about were the beds to low but whenever I laid on them I didn’t want to get up. The beds are therapeutic so they make sure you get a nice rest after so much walking. Very nice to know that beds are extremely comfortable here!!!
50,So glad we found 40% off semi annual sale for a last minute girls trip. This is my first stay at Park MGM - previously known as Monte Carlo . What an beautiful resort . Rooms were extra clean minimalist style and comfortable.
50,The Park MGM has nice rooms easy parking easy access to Las Vegas strip. The staff is very friendly and the casino has all the table and slot machines you could ask for. Room service was amazing and everything wasvery Covid safe.
50,This was not a pleasure trip what I was looking for was a place to rest that was centrally located The Park MGM was everything I was looking for. The rooms were quiet and comfortable and the showers were the best...(Plenty of hot water with excellent water pressure). Everything on the strip is within walking distance and shuttles are provided
50,All the staff was friendly. The hotel was very clean and the room was exceptionally clean. I am very happy to see the place clean. Two weeks ago I stayed a 4.5 hotel and it was horrible. I wanted to try a new place and thank God I did. I had the Best Experience ever. I do recommend Park MGM; specially with pandemic on how clean the place was and smelled.
50,Great new policy that will stay even after Covid restrictions are lifted. Rooms and service are always nice and I love the location to freeway and other major hot spots. Covid protocols were up and running and was impressed by the enforcement. Masks for free when you enter
30,It nice room super spacious did like that bathroom door had no lock travel with family so would of been nice to have b ut other than that is was a comfortable stay quick access to get to room most likely Iwould stay there again
50,I would totally stay here again! I just wish Starbucks open in the casino for some good coffee but other than that it was a great stay! Strip View was perfect Room service was great and the staff was so friendly and accommodating!
40,Overall I would recommend the Park MGM to anyone looking for great proximity to everything and good value for your dollar. The casino and rooms are clean and all the staff i interacted with were very friendly. Not as luxurious as say the Vadara but good place overall.
50,Park MGM is the perfect COVID property on a budget - close to a lot of exciting off-property options easy to access food options ARIA pool during winter and more. Really enjoy the innovative decor and room furnishing choice make it great for working from room vacation.    At this price point I much prefer this resort over other properties - Mandalay too far from everything MGM too old and crowded ARIA too expensive Wynn a bit too far and expensive Bellagio too overrated.
10,Worst stay in Vegas ever. The management team never called me back after my room was filled with marijuana smoke the unattended dog barking in the room next door did not allow me to sleep. This was a nightmare experience.
50,I will go back. Great beds great pillows I love how you can hookup your ROKU to their TVs with the very easy wall connections. Love that it’s smoke free my cloths didn’t stink when I came off the casino floor.
50,I enjoyed my stay at the Park Mgm it is a smoke free environment and that’s why I choose to book with them in the first place. Having played in the casino and taken some awesome pictures in the set up stages they have around the hotel made it easier to capture the memories with my fiancé. Would stay their again and my hotel room and view were great !!
50,Will make this our go to hotel for future stays! It was clean smoke free and the room was spacious. all the staff was friendly and respectful. Online check in was easy and quic . Look forward to the next trip!
50,Park is great because of its convenience. Everything in the hotel is a stones throw away. You won’t have to walk a mile to get out of the hote or to your car. The restaurants are great and the Eatly food court is super nice and new. Rooms are simple and classy. They just made it non-smoking which is super great as lots of people bring their pets and I get enough secondhand smoke while walking the strip. If you’re looking for a massive hotel with thousands of people and expensive rooms this is not the place. If you want a simple easy and fun place to stay definitely give it a shot.
50,We stayed three nights in November. The rooms were very nice and newly remodeled. The casino and other facility's were clean and also renovated. We were disappointed that some of the restaurants were closed but that was due to covid. Great location. We will stay here again.
50,Hotel was very nice. It’s clean modern and affordable. Only down side was many restaurants and the tram were closed due to covid but that’s to be expected. Would definitely stay here in the future!!!
40,There are definitely many options along the Las Vegas Strip. If I have to call out one thing about Park MGM it's the artistic touch inside the room. Many other hotels in the area will try to make the rooms grand or luxurious but Park MGM chooses to decorate the walls with pictures which is quite a balance when walking through casinos or conference venues for the whole day.
50,Park MGM is the ideal resort for those who want the Vegas experience while surrounded by a mature crowd in a smoke-free environment. Upon entry you can immediately see the attention to detail taken by the staff. The casino staff is incedibly hospitable and very engaging. The rooms are clean well appointed and the location is perfect.
50,Cleanest hotel in Vegas and nicest! All staff was friendly and the casino was clean and no smoking is allowed in the casino which is a plus. Definitely recommend to anybody who is going to Vegas Whether it be for pleasure or business
50,Park MGM provide a highly concern for sanitized and make you feel safe. When we arrive Check-in desk is transfer to Mobile self check in. There is a very friendly staff Toni she is very helpful and tell us everything we should know. She arrange perfect rooms for 3 family. Rooms are all clean and feel comfortable. Casino also with high frequently sanitized. Non-smoked casino provide a better air quality. We would like to stay again in the future.
50,Where can i start from the great location to the amazing rooms for a great price. The check in experience was amazing to start then a walk through the great hotel/casino to a beautiful king strip view room with a perfect bathroom with beautiful green tile that accented the room better than most rooms on the strip. The food available locally can't be beat eataly and crack shack are just some of the places available within 5 minutes of your room which are highly reccomended
50,The room is quaint if it’s just you and your partner. We are in our early 30s and the Park MGM has that type of crowd. The staff all around is nice the restaurants have great choices and prices and you’re super close to the strip. The room had amazing views.
50,My wife and I took a trip to Vegas in January 2021 decided to stay at the Park MGM after visiting Vegas many times since the remodel. At first we were hesitant after reading a few bad reviews but I am so glad we decided to give the hotel a try. The room was great super clean and very cozy. The casino was great as well a couple of cool lounges and restaurants to choose from plus there is a walk way that takes you straight to the Aria in a matter of minutes. If you are hesitant about booking this hotel just stop and book the room you won’t regret it!
50,Hotel very clean and stylish smoke-free great location.  Staff very friendly and helpful.  Online check-in was simple and quick and check-out was equally easy.  Room very clean and sylish very comfortable bed great shower.
10,The room was inexpensive but the photos they show on the website are nothing like the room. The room was hot and the ac didn’t ever cool the room to the chosen temp. The hallways are dark and it’s very confusing to get around. The rooms were tiny and for just being remodeled it was not good.
40,Loved that the casino is non smoking and the facilities are very clean. The location of the hotel is also very well located. However we had some issues with our room where the shower door leaked water and the blinds didn't work well
50,The best place to stay in Las Vegas! Great casino very comfortable rooms! Walking distance to other casinos tram great room service and very friendly staff! Non-smoking. Close to Aria and shopping lots of food options.
50,Excellent hotel that is smoke free! Staff was wonderful and location on strip is perfect! It’s clean and well kept. Love the Eatily section (upscale Italian food court). Had an issue with the room next door to us - they were having a small party. We called reception and security was up within 10 minutes politely asking them to turn off the music and keep it down. No problems after. Would definitely stay at this hotel again hands down!
40,Im in my 30s and I like things with a minimalist flavor to it. Im not saying  BY any MEANS  that this hotel is minimal . Its Classy and modern typically when you think of vegas you think grandure and sometimes even Tacky . This brings a good modern elegance with out going too far . From Decor to its casino Park MGM is like making the perfect choice everytime . Think about getting a fresh pair of converse and getting a fancy bowl of pasta with your purchase lol
10,Worst experience short staffed long waiting time for front desk help Inconsistency. My recommendation is to look else where. The casino lobby however is nice and clean guess if you are not looking to stay over the night. Still a fun place to spend some gambling time!
50,The experience was great! Staff is very courteous and I liked the fact that it’s centrally located on the strip. If I’m not staying at the Bellagio or Aria this hotel is my only other option so that should provide a picture of the quality of this hotel.
40,I always love being in Vegas and the Park is very easy to get to room quickly and is close to everything. Rooms are clean and the Beds sleep very well. They are working hard to comply with Corona Rules which is hard on the Guest but I don't blame them for that. They are just trying to follow the rules while keeping Guest safe.
50,Loved the smoke free environment! Nice room. Friendly and helpful staff. We will be back!    Everything was so clean and pleasant. Lots of choices for game play.    The pool area was so nice. The heated pool was a plus!    I recommend you stay at the Park MGM!
30,Check in was easy the lobby was clean. The rooms are basic as compared to other resorts in the area at the sma e price. No tub tinny closet was a joke no pens or writtinf pads and no Coffee makers in rooms
50,Stayed here for 5 days for New Years and enjoyed every minute of it. I enjoyed not smelling like an ashtray since it’s smoke free. The location is great and centrally located on the strip. There is a cvs next door and Walgreens across the street which made getting little room supplies easy.
50,Location is central. Check-in and check out extremely easy. Casino is smoke-free. Security managed elevator lines during peak time. Staff is friendly. Eataly is a bonus. When too lazy to walk the strip you can hang out at the marketplace for coffee pasta pizza or gelatto.
30,First time in Las Vegas and I guess I was expecting more for the money. I have had better service and nicer rooms in Best Western hotels across the country. No coffee machine the in room or mini fridge. Room was ok. won't be staying there again.
50,I sure did enjoy having to breath better without inhaling the smoke caused by SMOKERS. Having a mask and going into a NON-SMOKING area makes me feel so much better. We spent most of our time during the days we were in Vegas at the Park MGM. KOODOS to PARK MGM Non Smoking Policy.
30,The rooms and bathrooms were small. Kind of boring. Nothing really exciting about the hotel. Tried to upgrade since my husband and I were celebrating our one year anniversary. The upgrade change was to expensive so we opted out and just stayed in our room.
40,Had the pleasure to stay at Park MGM for New Years weekend. This Hotel/Casino has gone smoke free which is really nice. My wife and I stayed in a suite which was the perfect size to enjoy our 4 nights. The room was clean and very spacious. The bed was very comfortable and afforded me a great nights sleep. The shower had the best water pressure of any hotel I have stayed in. Overall this is a great hotel and has a great location to get around to other hotels. I would happily stay at this resort again.  Going to try NOMAD in Feb.
50,We had New Year's Eve dinner at Bavette for a prix fixe. The aged steak was very good very big and the sides very generous and very tasty. The service was top.  Primrose had a New Year's Day garden brunch all excellent food with a wide choice  EATALY is to die for. The service food pasta sandwiches meats wine and desserts are fantastic.  The casino was perfect for us we do not smoke but sometimes some casinos have that smoke smell that hangs on to your clothes or hair. No problems of the sort at Park MGM non-smoking!!!
50,I loved it and will be back again! The food was great the people were awesome and pool was warm and cozy .the housekeeper did a magnificent job and slots were so cool and fun to play .I loved the strip
10,Worst stay I ever had at an hotel. Wouldn’t stay here again. Room was cold whole stay and kept complaining. Kept getting wrong hotel key. Also had to keep begging for room service to come clean room. It’s sad
30,"I guess the old adage is true that you get what you pay for. I was heading to the Grand Canyon with my family and we just needed to overnight in Vegas for 1 night to break up our trip.    I'm a Hyatt Globalist and I wanted to stay in a Hyatt to get the elite credit for 2021 so I stayed here. There were many choices at affordable rates but this was the lowest at $48.75 + resort fee ($44.22) for a total of $92.97 per night. The resort fee is where they really get you as nothing is provided in the way of ""resort"".    I booked two adjoining rooms and the hotel was very dead. The rooms were a bit dated but were clean. One room had 2 queen beds and the other had 1 King bed.    On the plus side the hotel had good Covid protocols and there was only one person working at the front desk but you could do contactless check-in if you wanted and even make your own room keys with the computer there.    I was very surprised even though the hotel was dead that they said one of our two rooms wasn't available even though it was already 1 PM. To me this was a sign that they must only have a few floors and all the rest were closed. I didn't push the issue as we were going out anyway.    Later in the day I got an email that the room was ready and when I got to the hotel I just checked in on a computer and made my own room keys. I've never seen that system before.    This is a smoke free hotel even in the casino which was nice. Another huge plus is Eataly is located in the hotel which is fabulous. I'm MLife Platinum so I wouldn't have to pay for parking but parking is totally free in this hotel and you can come and go with no charges. This was nice as some casinos/hotels were surprisingly charging to park. I'm a Caesar's Diamond member so I didn't pay to park in those hotels while visiting but they were charging others.    My biggest issue with this hotel was there was a loud water drainage sound all night! I couldn't sleep due to this noise. I had room #217 and #219 so I'd avoid those rooms due to the water noise. I doubt it was from showers as it was so late at night when I heard it. Sounded like some drainage pipes in the building.    Like I said you get what you pay for. Still there were other options at many other hotels that were a bit more but much nicer so I'd probably do that if I had to do it over again."
50,ParkMGM is smoke-free and a smaller hotel so it is very easy to get around. You can get where you need to be without having to walk too much. The rooms are spotless. The beds are very comfortable. The staff is accommodating and attentive. Casino floor is clean and welcoming. It's a great set-up. The Park Theater is one of the best venues on the strip. Love this place.
50,Will definitely be staying at PARK MGM again!! Rooms were very clean and comfortable. Staff was helpful and friendly. Location Is perfect. Some hotels carry and/or attract a rowdy crowd...not here loved it.
20,They made us check in a dirty room alcohol and juice stained all over floor near fridge and they never came to clean it even after we asked them to. They never even asked us to move to a different room. The air conditioning didn’t work over basic basic room probably not staying here again
50,Had a great experience staying at the Park MGM. The entire resort was smoke-free and everything was very clean. Also they have great restaurants to chose from. It's also pet friendly though I did not bring my pet. We received complimentary masks and those keyrings to touch surfaces with as well as some hand sanitizer. I would say the bed is one of the most comfortable hotel beds I'm experienced in a while. The bathrooms were a good size though I was surprised to find a tub in the accessible room. Nonetheless I would totally recommend.
30,I've stayed at the MGM Park before but it was pre Pandemic. It was a very fine place. Guests during the pandemic were allowed to do what ever they wanted. I got off the elevator because I felt unsafe 3 times the first a person not wearing a mask told me to go fu ck myself the second a guy hung his mask on his chin and just told his partner that the mask would be on his side table in just a minute the third...I got on an elevator and 6 people piled in no one cared. This is a good place to stay bit some of your clients are sh it.
30,Couldn't sleep as walls are paper thin. I was put in a room that had a conjoining door and could her every word the other people in the room were speaking. They weren't being loud just talking normally....thats how thing walls were. Other than not getting any sleep the stay was good. I like how hotel is smoke free and wasnt overcrowded like some other hotels I visited
30,It was ok. Completely non smoking. Which I’m sure is ok for many but the lack of refrigerator having a husband who is a diabetic is tough. The view was nice. Also everything is closed. And I mean EVERYTHING. We had to go to other properties to eat get coffee drinks etc.
50,Great stay and very accommodating employees and clean room will surely be back good security . Nice ambiance nice paintings or frames arts . Wer planning to come back in May so hopefully will be back then . Thank you
50,New Years eve getaway to las Vegas was great. It was my first time staying at the Park MGM. The park MGM was great. Excellent customer service from all staff and all the covid precautions were met. I can't wait to return.
30,Service was good from staff however the rooms are just average! Not bad just not fancy as I expected for the star rating. I would stay again if the price is lower than competitors. Location is good on strip as well.
50,My husband and I had a great time staying at Park MGM for NYE. We felt safe during the pandemic as the hotel maintained a very clean environment. The staff at the hotel and casino were very friendly as well as inside the restaurants we visited
30,Aromatherapy and shower canister both not functioning (out of scent and vitamin c gel). Room was average. Remodel seemed cheap - painted wallpaper old outlet covers etc. room was clean. Staff very friendly/helpful.
40,bed was very comfortable room was spacious. Love the bench in front the window with the table great view from my room. It did take me awhile to find the ice bucket and glasses they were hidden by the bathroom door. Never thought to just close the bathroom door because I was traveling solo. My only complaint because I'm a smoker would be that the casino does not gave a smoking area. The other casinos i visited were able to separate smoking and non smoking.
50,Think you did the best you could for the times. Would have like a microwave to warm leftover food. Everything was great. Price for the holiday weekend was expected for new year do wish that there was more for the new year celebration but okay for the time.
10,The rooms were gross and dirty we didn’t even sleep under the covers because of how dirty they looked. There was also a picture of someone’s bare bottom on the wall which I felt was a little inappropriate as my toddler was with us on this family stay.
30,I didn’t like how far my room was from the elevator it really sucks to have to walk damn near a half of a mile to get to my room Also my shower water never got hot it was luke warm my whole stay but overall the room was cute💯 Short staffed
20,"Hotels system had a ""glitch"" as they called it and randomly charged me $100 multiple times at 4:30am during my stay. The hotel didnt offer anything accept an ""our bad"" and ""wait for the refund"". My trip had to be cut short and I'm still waiting on my money"
40,I like Park MGM for its size it’s not too small and not too big. I also love the fact that there is no smoking inside this casino. It’s hard enough to breathe nowadays and smoking makes it impossible. The room is worth the money but the window couch and the art could be better. Overall I say give it a try at least once.
50,Hotel is very clean smells great staff of very helpful great food. Beds were very comfortable and rooms are very spacious. We enjoyed our stay here very much and will be staying here again in the very near future!!
50,"We are Las Vegas Locals and wanted to do a weekend staycation for a change and we are very glad we did so. I love that the whole hotel including the casino is now NON-SMOKING. Self Parking was complimentary as well. We really appreciated that! Our stay at Park MGM was for check in on Fri. 12/18/2020 and check out on Mon. 12/21/2020 (3 Nights). We originally booked a Park MGM King Room but being M-Life Rewards Gold & Pearl Members + M-Life Rewards MasterCard Members we were surprisingly upgraded complimentary to a Park MGM Two Queen's Strip View Room which we highly appreciated and were extremely thankful. We arrived at around 11:30 AM and approached the Lobby/Check In Area and a very respectful & nice gentleman named Zach helped us out with the check in process. He was very honest and always willing to help out at anytime without any hesitation; he wanted all of his guests to be happy and enjoy a wonderful experience at Park MGM. That was a great start to our staycation and extremely appreciated that. We used the tablets to check in and right after that he went behind the front desk counter and said ""let me find you an amazing room."" After 2-3 mins later he came back and said the room is ready on the 28th Floor and we were able to create the room keys and got complimentary early check in which was great! We were very happy and when we approached to the room we noticed housekeeping was still cleaning the room so we went back down to the front desk explained Zach and he apologized to us many times as he felt bad. He then said let me upgrade you complimentary to a Stay Well Park MGM Two Queens Room for the inconvenience and we were extremely happy as well and we got the room right away on the 23rd floor as it's dedicated for Stay Well Rooms. We've never stayed in a Stay Well Room so once we went inside I was surprised how clean the room was the mattress was amazing the shower had a Vitamin C Infuser there was aromatherapy in the room the pillows were comfortable an air purifier for easy breathing and overall was a perfect room size at 406 Square Feet. Everything in the room was perfect and we had the view of T-Mobile Arena Allegiant Stadium The Park and other strip hotels as well. Our stay also included a $50 per day Food & Beverage Credit which was wonderful and got to enjoy great dining options such as Diablo's Cantina (Luxor) Aria Patisserie The Pub (Aria) etc... Everything was perfect from check in to check out and very well maintained. We felt extremely safe and had a wonderful time. We can't wait to do another staycation soon! Once again thank you very much Zach for everything and making our stay extra special!"
30,The hotel is nice along with the staff no major problems or outstanding service but the fact that there was no place to eat at all is a major turn-off for me. I am unsure why such a large hotel could not even have a place to purchase a pack of gum after 10pm is just unacceptable.
50,We love staying at Park MGM because it is really clean and recently remodeled. We just came back home from our latest visit to Las Vegas and as always we were satisfied. We are so glad Park MGM is now smoking-free and it had sanitizing stations everywhere! There was always a hand washing station and a station where you can get masks and gloves. Staff was friendly and felt safe.
50,This really a nice hotel in a great location on the south strip. It has a number of very good places to eat and very close to many others. I really like they have now gone to a smoke free environment.
20,welcoming and hospitable staff! but the rooms have extremely thin walls not recommended for families with young kids-- we heard EVERYTHING from 1am-4am (Saturday/sunday) night from next door rooms and our 7month old kept waking up. Not Cool
40,Considering we went during Covid-19 (Christmas) our stay was perfect. Staff was friendly and plenty of places to eat. NoMad Lounge was a nice place to enjoy great drinks and listen to a pleasant Piano player.
50,Everytime we come to park MGM it is always the best experience. From the restaurants to the games. Just wish the tables were minimum $5. Then i would actually play the tables. All in all its always a good time.
50,Quiet immaculate quiet overall nice. perfect location to everything and attractions  even shopping was close by like Marshalls and Ross. Very easy to get a lyft Very close to the airport which was a plus for us getting the the airport on time for our flight
50,This note was very clean great location to almost middle of strip. People were nice and it was quiet! But above all.. THANK YOU FOR BEING NON-smoking in all areas of the building! Free parking we a plus! Hallways were a little dark but that’s being picky.
50,Annual trip to Vegas with the MRS. we always tried hotels on strip and we trip the park 3 years ago and haven’t stayed anywhere else since then. Always clean always friendly and helpful staff not a crazy crowd of people and it’s close to everything.
50,The reception gave us a nice room close to elevators with a nice view. The manager at check out took care of some charges using our points. We were given a $50 Food Voucher and $20 free play that was very nice.
50,Great service and no smoking. The place smelled great! The eataly food area has everything which super cool and unique. Rooms was a suite and super big! Great slot games new ones not the old ones. Round bar is pretty cool place watch some football as well!
50,During covid I was extremely happy as to all the safety precautions and cleanliness. Also big bonus is it is a non smoking property which makes it healthy safer and smell lovely. All staff was extremely friendly as well. Big bonus eatitaly!
10,They gave us a complimentary suite but that got ruined by their casino that does NOT pay out. Not one machine. I did not see one person down there hit a jackpot or win anything. I lost thousands. Wish I stayed at their other Mgm properties. This one was the worst will not be back.
50,Room was exceptionally clean! The only thing is the door for the closet turns into the bathroom door. It would be nice to have two separate doors. Other than that everything else was great! Staff was friendly whenever we came across them.
50,The Park MGM just opened do to Covid we always stay at the Park at less two to three times a year. We stayed in accessible room an started to unpack when I noticed that there wasn't an place to store the clothes only hangers not a drawer to be had I called the front desk an was given keys to three rooms they were all the same so if you plan to stay at the Park don't take expensive clothes you will have to put them in a cubby hole next to the bed with you sock an underwear.
40,We stayed at Park MGM 12/11 weekend for a birthday trip. The hotel was clean check in was a breeze and we received a complimentary per person food voucher. Getting towels/roomservice was great. We had breakfast at Primrose and the steak and eggs were EVERYTHING!! The hotel is in walking distance to everything. This was our first visit to Vegas and it did not disappoint.
50,Excellent service and clean rooms. All of the staff provided excellent help and made it a pleasant experience. I would definitely stay at this hotel again. It was too cold to use the pool or the nomad club but I will next time.
50,Very clean establishment. Friendly staff. If you are looking for a smoke free place Park MGM is for you. Also with having M&M World Coca-Cola store and Hershey's Chocolate World with-in walking distance the grandkids had a blast. I think we have found our forever stay when we visit Las Vegas.
50,This was a smoke free hotel that my family loved and being across the street from M & M world and coca-cola world and next to Hershey world. And only being limited things to do with kids being under 10 years old this was the perfect spot to stay.
50,The checkin/checkout was easy and very convenient. The room exceeded our expectations. We loved that the hotel wa a completely smoke free. It would have been nice to have more room service options but the location is close to tons of restaurants so it ended up being fine. We will definitely stay there again!
10,*Check in was annoying. We were asked to walk over to a kiosk desk to be checked in with a tablet. Text was sent and tried three times (employee said it would work on the third try) before finally being told to walk over to another desk to try the computer.  *The room was HOT & stale. The AC was not available due to the season (December). It was very uncomfortable. We were told that fans were not available.  *I woke up covered in bed bug bites. I had to wash EVERYTHING and throw away my luggage. DISGUSTING.
20,"The reservations department is a nightmare to deal with. They make you email over requests and then never confirm that they've received your email or that they have done what you have requested. Expect to sit through the phone menu from hell each time you call to make sure the requests have gone through. Even then prepare to get to the hotel early to ensure that all the requests were done correctly. Even when you send in a list of guests names and list which names should go to which rooms it isn't done correctly. Whole names are made up. Anticipate being put on hold without notice if the manager doesn't like your request. Expect to have to fight for any ""special"" requests like guaranteed connecting rooms for parents and their children in an empty hotel. It probably would have been easier to cancel my reservations and move to a different hotel than to have to keep fighting for basic assistance like adding guest names correctly."
50,Staff was very polite and helpful casino was smoke free which was great I had my little one. Overall it’s a great place to stay at whether it’s with friends or family everything is literally walking distance
50,In spite of the added virus protocols it was an excellent stay. Eataly and Prmrose were open and we took advantage of both. We appreciated that the casino had been made into a smoke free venue.  After check-in and getting squared away we found our room in great shape very clean. We elected to skip the daily room cleaning (we arrived on Thursday left on Sunday) so no worries.
40,Hotel was nice and in appearance and atmosphere just think things could have been handled a bit better maybe it’s because they are only open 4 nights a week and don’t care that much! But because Of covid im not going to hold it against them too much will have to see post covid if things are the same
50,Perfect place to stay and visit the Raiders Allegiant Stadium prices are great with great accommodations in the heart of LV strip. Great dining in experience and comfortable spacious rooms. Would recommend.
50,Customer service Housekeeping and security is the best at this hotel. They are #1 in my book. Casino area was very clean. The restaurant food was very good also. I have a room booked for 12/10... and was just there 12/04-12/07!!
50,The “smoke-free” experience of Park MGM is priceless!!! Gone are the days of smelling like an ashtray after visiting a typical Vegas casino. The entire staff was courteous and helpful. The folks at the Sportsbook were very patient with me seeing how it was my first time placing a sports bet. The centralized location on the strip is great especially if your traveling with family. There are plenty of stores that are within walking distance to visit.
50,Park MGM gave me 20$ freeplay for my birthday! I had a great time and was thankful that Park MGM was located in a decent spot on the strip! I even got upgraded to a room in the NoMad for free! I would definitely recommend staying here (:
40,This was my first time staying at Park MGM since the remodel . Check in process was easy comfortable bed and pillows small casino few dining options (Eatly area is work checking out for Italian food and large assortment of wine!)  and great location. The only downside was no fridge/mini bar and no tub. Simple room design and small rooms but overall I enjoyed my stay and the price was reasonable with mlife card during Thanksgiving weekend. This hotel is not luxurious but nice for a brief stay.
10,I am a mlife member and always choose to stay with MGM properties. This time I got invited to ParkMGM based on a promotional offer. Although the room is newly renovated the decor and materials look very cheap. But most importantly the bed mattress is horrible. We had two queens both my friend and I woke up with severe back pain. And the second night we couldn’t even fall asleep on the bed. One of us had to sleep on the couch. I stayed in a King room before it was slightly better. But Queen room is just unacceptable.
30,Not the place to stay until things open back up! There were very limited food options. We returned one evening at 8:45PM and the only thing open was Side Betty Grill. That was our option you “you can go to another M-life hotel.” Casino is dead no energy. I don’t think I ever saw a table game being played dealers just stood there. Slots were TIGHT!
50,Park MGM is none smoking environment it's been upgraded to a higher level it's nice and clean perfect for a family trip nice and friendly staff eataly is a nice food court safety parking highly recommended for every one.
50,Went out for a trip but found a nice little Italy eatery their It was delicious good pastries  in casino well you know how that goes back  in forth  in and out  as for the room this second time staying some are different but very clean
40,Barn door is used for bathroom/closet. Not a good idea when sharing a room. Also not enough drawers for multi people. If we had 4 people to a room which two beds provide the drawers would definitely not work. For two of us they barely worked because we left our suitcases full.
50,Very nice place to stay. Great view! Easy to check in. Nice quiet room with plenty of amenities for the price. This was for a quick getaway and couldn't have smoother. We will be staying again for sure!
10,unfriendly staffs dirty toilet in the room. You can even hear next door neighbor opening and closing the window curtain.  No privacy. I had to call the front desk twice to take care of next door loud music.
40,"I been here before a few times... It is located pretty nicely. Rooms are just eh... You can hear a lot of sounds outside and in the halls. They still charging for ""resort fee"" and the resort is pretty much closed. 1/3 of the places are open."
50,Good getaway from Cali. Safe healthy protocols in place. Great location staff and amenities. Outstanding Value! Thanks to all the staff for staying positive in these trying times!!! Made me feel at home away from home.
50,We spent a long weekend at Park MGM celebrating my son’s 35th birthday. The Park was clean well sanitized and staff was very welcoming. Park is centrally located on the strip making it convenient to other casinos shows and restaurants.
40,There was an issue with the cleanliness on first day For the most part our stay at the hotel was good not great.I like that the fact the hotel is smoke free now which is great. And that they provide masks and gloves for everyone.
30,It was just an average stay at an average hotel nothing special. No coffee in the rooms. A Motel 6 offers coffee in the room at a list price. Yes I do realize it is in Vegas you’re going to pay more for a hotel but you expect to get more. Paid the $15 to upgrade the room to room with a view the strip still had a view of the building next to it that’s all.Wasn’t worth paying the extra money to upgrade.
30,It wasn’t as new as they picture it. The mattress and floor were not new but the bathrooms were clean. The walls are thin because I heard the tv next door and when the people next door were taking showers and talking. The roulette dealer Yong downstairs was so rude and unfriendly when we were winning and tipping him! He never said thank you or answered us when we asked him a question. He shouldn’t be working if he’s miserable at his job.
50,Pleasant stay and provided all the things needed for safety. Hotel staff is nice. Fade masks sanitizers are provided. Best thing I love about this facility is it is a Non Smoking facility. MGM made a non smoking casino is possible.
50,If your looking for new and upcoming place to stay at you have to check out ParkMGM whether it is for two people or a group this place will accommodate a good amount with a comfortable stay. Easy access to and from the strip and close to sporting events area!
50,The hotel is in a great location but with limited dining choices with in the property due to Covid. The casino floor was pretty empty the whole weekend and the best thing is that it's a non smoking casino
50,Excellent experience from the call to reserve through to valet bell desk and checkin/front desk. Friendly happy helpful and efficient. Clean attractive and very comfortable room. Loved the experience. Plus Primrose restaurant is right downstairs and is excellent.
40,I was visiting with a group of friends for my birthday and selected Park MGM as it's centrally located on The Strip and their pricing was competitive. I discovered to my delight prior to the trip that when the hotel reopened it was smoke-free definitely a plus as a non-smoker. Our rooms were nice clean and we were provided COVID-safety kits containing masks hand-sanitizer and other items. Due to COVID a number of restaurants and food options in the hotel were closed but given it's location there were many other options nearby. The Primrose on-site was an excellent selection for breakfast/brunch. The hotel staff were outstanding and attentive from the assisted check-in process in the lobby to the security staff who were visible all over safety and security were clearly a priority for them. I was very happy with my selection of Park MGM and I would definitely stay there again in the future.
50,I had a great room at the park mgm . The staff at the front desk greeted me and even made suggestions if i was hungry on what's open to eat at. They didn't tell me about the 100 dollar deposit but that was miner . Thw bed was comfortable and the shower felt great good water pressure.
40,Great property & we loved the smoke free casino. Only negative is the doors are loud when closing and this did wake me up a few times. If you aren't a light sleeper this shouldn't be an issue. Lots of security as well which made you feel safe.
40,We loved our Halloween weekend mother/daughter trip to LV! Our the 28th floor room was marvelous! The room art was a little different. I loved that there was no smoking inside the hotel & casino!!! The staff was top notch!
10,Park mgm canceled my stay for November 11th through November 16th. I was offered a reservation at mgm grand for the same price as my reservation at park mgm. However I could book the same reservation at mgm directly for less than my reservation at park mgm. They didn't offer the difference back. So not only was my reservation canceled they tried to rip me off as well. I booked with Paris instead.
40,Appreciate the smoke free environment of the casino floor! But you can still smell what years of smoking in an enclosed space does—- the odor never goes away. Checked in Thursday— truly a ghost town. Just happy to have somewhere to celebrate my birthday during COVID. Friday night crowds started to pick up. It’s interesting to see all the health and safety measures being used— plexiglass dividers on the craps and blackjack tables— everything being constantly whipped down.
40,Park MGM is a great place to stay for the price! In 2018 they redid the whole interior of the hotel and moved to a smoke-free experience in all areas. This has lead to a hotel on the strip that is really clean and smells great! It's such a nice break from the smell in other areas of the strip. The rooms are modern and if you get lucky enough to have a room facing the aria you'll be rewarded with an amazing nighttime view. Their casino is clean and the shops around it are chic and modern. Those shops added to a great overall experience. LAST THING! The front desk staff are fantastic! It was my gf's bday and without hesitation gave her a redemption ticket for 2 free drinks! The staff found out just by having casual conversation while checking us in. 10/10 would recommend again. I'm even tempted to sign up for the MGM rewards because of this experience.    The only reason I ranked it a 4/5 was because I'm saving 5/5 for those hotels that blow me away. This hotel was close but no cigar (pun intended because of their smoke-free policy). I would give it 4.5/5 if I could!
50,This hotel is conveniently located between the New York New York Casino T-Mobile arena and the Aria. We were very excited to learn the entire hotel/casino is now smoke free! Our first impression was their parking garage - what a great experience! Each parking spot has an indicator light (red or green) above it so you can see at a glance which parking spots are available and parking is currently free like it used to be. The hotel’s interior is a pleasing green with an outdoor/park theme. Our room was very spacious with a couch leather chair and table. Our bedroom and bathroom had green accents which was very soothing. Our friends’ room had red accents which we would probably not have liked as well. Since they had three banks of elevators that served different sets of floors we never spent any time waiting for an elevator. Some of the many restaurants are still closed due to COVID-19 but we had breakfast at Primrose one morning and enjoyed it. The resort fee is $39+tax daily which seemed like a pure money grab.
50,me and my husband had a great time we felt safe and it was very comfortable. employees was very friendly. I would stay again. The dining was great rooms and bathroom was clean no smoking in the hotel which was great I love the park and it was only minutes from ross Marshall and burglington
50,"Hi everyone. Have not reviewed in a while as we regularly stay at the JW Marriot in Summerlin or the M Resort in Henderson NV. Well last year we stayed at the Bellagio for a conference so I have received some comp offers from MLife. We decided to give the strip another try as we had basically decided that off strip properties were better suited for us. Ok so here goes...    After not being on the strip for 8 years or so less last year at the Bellagio for 3 nights we decided to give the Park MGM a try.    The offer was a good one and the hotel just opened on Sept.30th. Everything is sparkling clean and the hotel staff are warm and welcoming. The room is lovely though small. However I was pleasantly surprised at how well thought out everything is. Lots of outlets dimmer in the bathroom nice little shelf in the bathroom and nice small dresser in the closet. Bed and linens are comfortable. During Covid I think they are doing an exceptional job trying to keep everyone safe while still providing a casual atmosphere. There is even a covid pack with mask sanitizer etc in your room on arrival.    The casino staff are friendly and the machines are normal. I did not win too much but hey they were not throwing money at you even before Covid so.... Just play for fun and you will be ok.    So here's my one negative. I was sitting at the bar playing and wearing my mask. Scott the bartender was wonderful and friendly. I took my mask off to drink my drink while playing. Mind you I was surrounded by welcomed plexi glass. As I finished my drink and decided to move I was corrected by another guest (An older man) for not wearing my mask at that moment. I told him politely that I was drinking my drink. He insisted that I was suppose to drink my drink and wear my mask in between Really? Ok so here's the thing people. Let the casino staff instruct people on mask protocol OK? It's hard enough being a rule follower right now (which I gladly am) without having mask police from the guests at the hotel. WE are all still trying to be on vacation after all. Just sayin.... If you have a mask on just be glad and leave the rest to the hotel. We are all navigating this thing the best we can. I must admit it put a damper on my evening and I wish it had not. I told him ""thank you for your concern"" like the lady my mom raised me to be but just thought I'd share the experience for those of you drinking at the bar and those of you who think it's your business who is wearing a mask or not...    Anyway don't let this little rant discourage you from coming to the Park MGM. The hotel is lovely and the staff are amazing. I personally still prefer the off the strip properties but probably because I am over 50. lol. Come support Vegas. Come to the Park MGM. They are doing their very best to entertain you and keep you safe during these times. Support their efforts if you are able. Enjoy and keep safe. Best to you and yours."
50,"Used American Airlines frequent flyer points for 4 nights but had to use real money to pay for resort fees $39 x 4 nights. Every bit as good as The Mirage Caesar's Palace Cromwell & Mandalay Bay. Perhaps not as dripping in excess as Wynn Venetian Aria or Waldorf Astoria. People should appreciate this: they are over-staffed (not enough customers) free self-parking and the garage is maybe 15% full = you get the super close spaces; no long lines to speak to someone or get something done.    I'm not sure what the benefits were but they gave me a STAY WELL room. Sort of a tranquil minimalist room with enough room to swing a cat because the dresser is nestled behind sliding door that either closes off the bathroom or the dresser. The beds are very low to the ground (no apparent advantage.) Many nice soft over-stuffed towels shampoo body wash etc. The shower is big/ long rectangle. It has 2 nice triangular ledges for shampoo razors etc.    50"" TV mounted against the wall with no dressers or other obstructions in front of it. It took me a few days to figure out the tv guide closed captioning and jumping back and forth to the previous channel but that's my fault. Tons of room to pace back and forth when having a high anxiety phone call (but that's a different story.)    the bldg has 3 elevators. My bank was for floors 23 - 32; I was on floor 23. No waiting for elevators (they have almost no customers.)  Not the best view. It looked down on T-Mobile arena but had views of: NYNY Excalibur Mandalay Bay Delano and the top 30% of Luxor. The Orleans was 9 blocks direct West in the distance. I could also see two huge garages for the arena and the I-15 freeway.    The lobby (thankfully) had new fresh green carpet. ditto the lobby walls and other items like wrought iron fences. They utilized all 3 pools on Sunday 10/4 and just 1 pool during the week. They had almost no customers. All 3 pools are the same size. There isn't any one pool that stands out as advantageous over the other pools. Of course they had waitresses security and managers working in an over-staffed environment. The pools have a maximum depth of four feet which is a big difference from the 3'6"" depth at The Aria next door.    They really don't have a kick ass Sports gambling area like Caesars Mirage or Westgate. They have just one long long counter to place bets with two workers and just one lonely table in this lobby / foyer area. The remainder is a restaurant where you have to be seated order expensive food and drinks; however this area is jam packed with 30 tv's mounted on various flat surfaces. No tv is bigger than 72"". So no you can't just go in there and plop yourself down and watch games all day and not pay for anything ! ... unless you're lucky enough to get that ONE round table for 4 near where the guys take the gambling bets. However you can walk to The Aria and accomplish the same thing (unless it's a Saturday /Sunday and there's covid) and they have this whole texting wait list thing. During the week you can do this at The Aria Sportsbook (another MGM property.)    Your room key is needed to select your floor in the elevator and you have to prove that you have an active room key to the guy letting people into the pools.    So I would definitely go back. I might even be willing to pay for a room next time when my American Airlines points are all used up."
50,This hotel was perfect for my friends and I. Conveniently located to everything on the strip! So many options for restaurants nearby. The rooms were really nice too the only thing I wish they had in the rooms was a mini fridge. We had a great view! I would stay at the hotel again for sure!
50,We stayed here when visiting Vegas to see Lady Gaga’s residency show. It was so convenient to be able to stay in the same place and really well priced for the convenience too! We had a large group so stayed in a Nightingale suite and it was really nice. Very spacious and more than enough room for all of us! Also the Haus of Gaga was right downstairs too which we obviously loved!
40,"Great room. We selected a ""stay well"" room and were very happy with it. The room has it's own air purification system which is great if you have allergies. The view from our room was nice and very quiet."
10,We stayed August 2018. We checked in got to our room and the key wouldn’t work. My fiancé went back down to the desk to get the key fixed. We got into our room but there was someone else’s bag in the room. Called the desk and they gave us someone else’s room. Back down to the desk to fix the room issue. Got to our 2nd room and the door was difficult to open...because someone was in the room trying to prevent us from getting in THEIR room! Back down to the desk. Got our 3rd room made the supervisor come with us to make sure it was all good. There was nobody in that room but we ended up with 2 queens instead of the king that we requested. They did give us coupons.    Beware of the pool chairs. I was adjusting the back when it slammed down on my middle finger ripping the tip off. Spent the night at the hospital to have surgery in the morning to sew my finger back together.    All in all it was a nightmare trip! And the hotel was not helpful at all!
50,I’ve stayed here when it was the Monte Carlo but recently returned to see Aerosmith at the Park Theatre. The theatre is perfect it’s small enough that even the cheap seats have good views. Very impressed with the remodel! We ate at LalaNoodle and it was great! The waiters and chefs there were very good with my food allergies and I felt super comfortable about it. Good food and drinks before our show.
50,I used to live in Las Vegas and remember when this was Monte Carlo. Great location but not so great restaurants the interior needed a face lift and nothing on property was much of a draw. I absolutely love with they've done with the remodel. Looks great inside (more hip and modern) and now they have really good restaurants like Eataly and Best Friend. Rooms are nice as well. Would 100% stay here on any future trips back to Vegas because of what it has to offer onsite as well as its proximity to T Mobile and the rest of the Strip. Reasonably priced too!
50,Park MGM is the best hotel experience you can imagine! We have enjoyed this hotel for decades! ( Formally The Monte Carlo) Joel Heidtman is the executive host at the hotel. He has always treated us like royalty. The customer service dining experiences suites casino and pools have been excellent. Prices are affordable and the location is ideal. I would never stay anywhere else. Planning another retreat soon!
40,We had a decent stay at the Park MGM. We had a 1 bedroom King and it was clean and large. Not much decoration or visually pleasing but still nice for the price. It's in a good location near the center of the strip. Eataly was really nice and had a variety of food to choose from. We drove to Vegas this time and they have a parking garage attached to the hotel which was convenient. Plus we have a Pearl M Life rewards card and the parking fee was waived. Not a bad choice to stay at if you want a nice hotel without breaking the bank.
30,Stayed just 1 night before moving to Wynn due to unavailability at Wynn.Did not care for the whole check yourself in on computer confusing !!! room was ok clean and tidy but not a great overhaul casino and areas very commercial not a lot of class but all in all for the cost it was ok
30,I usually don't stay on the Strip but I had a free night stay at Park MGM from a game on Facebook. Checking in was unique (via a touch screen) and quick. The room was clean and extremely quiet. While I preferred the restaurants more when they were the Monte Carlo there is still a good variety.
50,Stayed here while in town for a trade show. Great clean resort with lots of good food options. Total food overload at Eataly but oh so good. Very good location to explore the strip. A little far from the convention centre but the free shuttle was usually pretty quick. Rooms are very clean and well decorated. Only problem I had was with the adjoining room we had we could here the neighbour a little more than we would have liked. Overall great place and I would stay here again in a heartbeat.
50,We were at the Park MGM for Aerosmith in July of 2019. The property was brand new and we really were there just for the concert. It was our great fortune to learn the property has such fun and delicious restaurants! There is an Eataly which you should not miss! If you're unfamiliar with this place it is excellent high quality authentic Italian food in a variety of different styles laid out almost food court style. It has a more casual vibe that could trick you into thinking the food is also more laidback but it is top notch. Everything is made fresh there it is the hallmark of the Eataly concept - the best freshest ingredients. You can get anything from pizza to pasta to steak or seafood and of course many dessert options. This makes it really nice for families as you can also enjoy great wine or cocktails with your fancy steak or charcuterie while the kids choose their own pizzas. The property has a really unique aesthetic very mod designed to feel like you are inside a park but this felt weird to me because it's also quite dark. A lot of attention clearly to the design very 60's retro cool honestly I did not love it. I prefer cozy and warm feeling and the dark spaces with ambient lighting combined with park murals gave an oddly disjointed feel. This did not dampen my enthusiasm one bit though as the bed was comfy the show was amazing and the food was delightful!
30,Multiple things went wrong during our stay. Book room 3 days in advanced then room rate fell by more then 50% at check-in and was not pro-rated only given a dining credit. Kinda of made me feel like I was penalized for reserving early instead of waiting last minute. Room service also took an extended period of time and order was wrong when it was recieved.
50,We had a great stay at Park MGM. Everything was clean beds were comfortable and staff was friendly. We enjoyed playing shuffleboard at the Bet MGM sports bar eating at Side Betty Grill and the concerts at the Park Theater.
50,Stayed one night in a double queen room with strip view. The room was amazing! Very nicely decorated with everything a traveler could possibly need provided. Comfy beds and pillows super view and very quiet. Every employee was friendly helpful and very nice looking. Highly recommend for couples or families.
40,I was only there one night so I did not get a chance to utilize all aspects of this facility. However everything I experienced with her a positive the staff was friendly in the hotel in my room very clean and nice.
10,"over charged - called to get this corrected and was treated very poorly by ""Henry"". Bad faith on MGM to do this and then have their staff treat customers this way. Lots of places to stay in Las Vegas had we known we'd be over charged by MGM we'd of stayed elsewhere"
50,I stayed here before the remodel 2 years ago....just stayed last week and the hotel is awesome. We ate at Best Friend (Roy Choi) and food was great. We also took advantage to eat at Eataly inside the hotel to do a cheese/meat tasting before we had a late reservation elsewhere. Housekeeping was great rooms were really nice with large showers. Perfect location off the strip.
20,"The initial look of the hotel is nice but once you get a room that's where they get you. The walls are less than soundproof and you can literally hear everything in the room next door. Compare the time frame of your stay to the T-Mobile Events. Also we had another girl in our party have issues with threats from the adjoining room. Quite scary...hotel's response ""Happens all the time in Vegas."""
40,Other than the walls being thin and the food being bland I thought this place was great. Access to the concert venue made it worth it! Staff was super friendly since you'd see the same faces each day.
50,I chosen this place because of the ncaa but it was cancelled and I wasn't going not to leave so I stayed and enjoy the room's and the whole environment of the park mgm was great. And the location was great right across from Dennys for a reasonable price meal.
30,The floors and rugs were full of long black hairs throughout the room. I was walking around in my white socks and looked down each day to my feet that looked like Sasquatch from walking around.    The sheets had stains in them as well.
20,Hotel is outdated and not kept up.  Long walking distance to most places we visited. Not many choices for food. Was way overpriced for low quality food. Check in is all on computers. Not very personal.
40,Overall hotel was nice and popping staff was friendly and view was great but nothing in the room accommodates couples or more than a single person and no refrigerator. Definitely not alot of closet space for a couple. Maybe should have suggested an upgrade to a suite. As a female I bring lots of clothes and was only able to hang 4 items and the rest stayed in the suitcase wrinkled. My other half couldn't hang anything or put away anything.
50,friendly help great personnell helping check in and out convient location to other facilities good food choices. clean rooms close to garage for parking. friendly atmosphere clean casino Very family friendly
10,The location of the hotel is excellent. It's closed to every activity...  The hotel is not so clean and I was forced to ask for another room as the first one what smelling cigarets. The second room was very noisy as walls seem to be very thin.  It is very impersonnal as you can stay in this hotel without seeing and/or discussing with anyone. You even do your check-in and check-out yourself.  And I'm not talking about the price... I definitely not recommend it.
30,We chose because of the location for the Park Theater and T-Mobile for seeing events and an on site Avis. Rooms were average which was surprising. Very limited late night options for food and drinks.
40,My most recent trip to Las Vegas involved at stay at the Park MGM resort. The newly renovated resort was very pleasant and centrally located with accessibility to many attractions and venues. The only negative I have is the bed in my suite was worn out and I about rolled out onto the floor from the sag of the mattress.
20,Resort fee was ridiculous when u dont use the pool or gym customer service was poorpeople were grouchy and acted like you were bothering them. Rooms were extremely overpriced no amenities in room. Just very disappointed
50,Elizabeth was our favorite cocktail waitress we have ever experienced in Las Vegas. We enjoyed starting and ending our gambling day at Park MGM. Great location with quick and easy access to the Strip.
50,This Resort is in a great location for entertainment and safety. Due to the size of Park Theatre it made the Bruno Mars concert amazing. They provide a tram that travels to the Bellagio and that helps with the walking to other resorts
40,Parking covenient at this property. Park mgm charges 15$ per night for parking. Room key gets u in and out of garage. Be warned however that on event nights at the T mobile arena parking is much harder to access. Check in is done at kiosks which there were many. Check out also done at kiosks. They did have prompt human service if u needed help with the check in check out process. The rooms were well appointed and clean. Loved the nice walk in tile shower. Tv on wall easily viewed from bed or long sitting bench along large windows...loved the blackout drape. No refrigerator or microwave. Small weighted snack tray in room with water. You remove a snack you buy snack at a premium price. Suggest stopping at store prior to checking in to pick up water and snacks etc..water bottles in lobby run 7$ range. King bed nice not to soft not to firm. Excellent daily maid service. Numerous power and phone charging ports in room. 3 pools. Casino on site. Starbucks on site. Amazingly no smoke smell in lobby or hallways to rooms. Also free tram by property to bellagio making getting to central strip easy.
10,I booked this room weeks in advance. Due to the caronivirus they experienced significant cancellations but wouldn't adjust my rate. In addition I could clearly hear my neighbors talk and sneeze. At these rates I expected a mini-fridge. They are so common I didn't look to verify there wasn't one. That's my bad.
50,"Watched this being renovated and well worth it. Drive sup is easy rooms gorgeous restaurants delicious great location at the other end of the strip- near Mandalay Bay. With the addition of Eataly (like NYC)- it's just too good to be true. The Grand Theater is home to Lady Gaga when she is in residence. The ""NoBu"" Hotel is also within this property- (thus a hotel within a hotel)- smaller with funky cool decor- it's nice for coziness. Have to book way out for either - but certainly worth it!"
40,Sufficient and clean rooms but no microwave or mini-fridge. Easy walking distance to several themed casinos shops and restaraunts so that was convenient. Would stay there again on a future trip to Vegas.
50,Nightingale Suite was very clean and spacious casino floor close to elevators Primrose had great breakfast options; service was quick and meal quality. Every staff member we encountered was super nice. Went to Bruno Mars and all seats had a clear view. The gym was very nice. I would recommend staying at the Park.
50,This is by far one of my favorite hotels on the strip due to location price and pristine customer service. The room was in pristine clean sheek condition. It was a beautiful room. We arrived after 4am on Saturday morning and had no trouble being accommodated. Love love park Mgm. I always try to stay here when in Vegas
40,If you want free drinks while playing go to another casino. Rooms and staff make up for it. The italian market is amazing and reccomend trying the diffrent foods. Sportsbook is small but the staff is great
50,Love the location easy to exit and access other casinos especially since I have a handicapped family member. They accommodate connecting rooms bell service was ADA accommodating. Great restaurants and excellent service beyond excellent! Unfortunately I didn’t win at the slots...oh well!
40,The check in process was efficient. The room clean and comfortable. good choice of restaurants. Would have preferred if there was a microwave mini refrigerator and coffee. Stayed here mainly to attend a concert at the Park Theatre.
50,Once again we had a great time and enjoyed our stay at Park MGM. Nice restaurants with great food selection to choose from unbeatable location very clean rooms and friendly staff. We will be back soon!
40,The hotel was clean the rooms were not as up dated as I expected but the service was great. Check in was very easy and the service was very professional. The attendance in the lobby were helpful and the lobby was aesthetically inviting. It was the most updated area in the hotel.
30,The property is poses a bit of a challenge to get tokind of hidden. The staff is not very hospitable. The decore is nice but the rooms and carpeted hallways need to be cleaned more thoroughly. The site has potential but our overall experience was nothing to write home about. I would love to give them another chance if they'd address those areas mentioned. There are too many options with regard to where to stay for any property to slack off on any areas of the hospitality experience. Any property can host a guest once but to ensure repeat business make it worth a guest's time and hard earned dollars!
40,Good overall stay. Sheets seemed to be stiff like they were ironed with starch. Casino was nice and clean check in was extremely efficient with the electronic check in. Good location and friendly staff.
50,Between the friendly staff sparkling clean rooms fun casino dealers proximity in location I can’t say enough good things about Park MGM. It was the best choice for vacationing in Vegas and definitely will be returning.
40,We visited and stayed at the Park MGM for a Bruno Mars and couldn't be happier with our choice. It's a very nice modern hotel with nice amenities and facilities. The room was modern and comfortable though it was a little smaller than King rooms we've stayed in other properties. Would definitely stay here again.
40,good location and room enviroment. but no water boiler no drinking water offered.  it's very convienent to transfer between park mgm aria and another famous hotel. MGM guests can get some discount in any of these three hotels.
40,MGM did a great job remodeling I have stayed at the Monte Carlo before and didn't realized Park MGM was the Monte Carlo.    Rooms are very clean staff is great. The restaurants are top notch! both steak houses and noodle restraurants highly recommend.    One pain the ass process-  You have to convert your M-Life Points to cash before you can use it pay for tab.
40,This was the forth time we stayed at this hotel. Gone through the the renos over the years. We love the place. For the prices it is a beautiful place.    Only disappointment the Eately. Had late dinner after a show most placing were closed or closing. Had roast chicken and potatoes. No flavour to the food. Basically threw most of it away. There were some brussel sprouts that were added to the potatoes. Did not ask for. They ran out of cutlery and they served it in takeout container.    Another time had breakfast pizza from there it was delicious. Daily early morning Americano coffee gets a thumbs up.
40,Overall a nice stay. The rate was not corrected as requested Due to the rate change that I notified staff of during check in. An attempt to waive resort fees to account for the change in rate was poorly done.
30,"There's no refrigerator nor microwave. According to the maintenance man the air conditioning unit cools by the use of cold water not compressed refrigerant; therefore the room never got cool. The maintenance man gave us a $25 off voucher for the ridiculously priced NoMad restaurant in which requires a reservation. I can see why the Monte Carlo had trouble staying afloat. Then MGM sticks me for $170 more at checkout which was $135 in ""resort fees"". To best clarify our experience I've had better experiences at Comfort Inn."
50,Love this hotel! The dining experiences were wonderful. The casino is smaller and just enough. I loved the pools. Primrose was amazing for breakfast. Eataly was great with so many options. I can't wait to stay again!
20,You’re better off staying ANYWHERE else on the strip it’s like they stuck a typical Dallas hotel on the strip. Meh should be the name LOVED Monte Carlo. This is not it anymore I’m trying to meet 200 character limit.
50,The rooms were nice and comfortable. The food was plentiful and delicious. The gym was nice and clean along with all the pools! But at the time of check in there were additional fees that the hotel failed to tell me about.
50,Wow! What a great surprise to experience the new Park MGM! Our room was immaculate; the service was top notch and the variety of restaurants was unbelievable. Only because we were curious did we venture out on the strip. The Park MGM literally had everything we needed or could want. Eataly is our favorite new LV obsession!
50,Stayed to attend Fleetwood Mac concert. It was easy to walk to the venue and we didn’t have to wait for Lyft or Uber. Ate at Eataly inside Park MGM. It was very good with a lot of choices and a nice bar. Ate at Primrose and seems like the quality of food has changed in the last few months. Might not go back there.
40,We really enjoyed the location of the park MGM. Located conveniently next to the T-Mobile arena New York New York MGM grand and the hard rock café. Usually we stay about the middle of the strip but this was a nice change. Great rooms. Super convenient off the 15 freeway I would definitely stay there again. Plenty of food places you may not need to leave the hotel area at all unless you just want to go sightseeing
50,Such a wonderful time on my bday tripme and my husband and friends enjoyed our stay  will totally do it again. Everything was perfect. Easy access to other casinos great food too. I loved everything
30,We had a Nightingale Suite and 3 additional rooms for a 3 night stay. Rooms were clean but felt like they needed to be upgraded. The suite is overpriced fir the “amenities” it provided. We had previously had a jacuzzi room which I would highly recommend from our experience a year ago but other than location the cost is not really worth it. Also if you get a Roulette dealer that’s is an older skinnier looking version of Albert Einstein AVOID whatever table he is at! Bad attitude (if you taking my money at least make me feel good about it) he was very unlike able than proceed to finally smile as he waved and said “goodbye-goodbye”!!!! PitBoss came over but this jerk was still there the next day! These are the type of people they allow to run their games....We (a group of 15 people vowed to never spend another penny on their casino floor after that.  Pros-location  Cons- cost of the rooms considering the “amenities” provided not worth it! And the jerk they allow to run the Roulette table!
40,Awesome place 3 pools very friendly staff right next to T-Mobile arena BeerHaus if you are into micros. Ticket office got us tickets to a fantastic show on the same day. Booze too pricy at casino $16 for 24 oz Budweiser at pool really for a Budweiser?
50,Great value and location staff so friendly and too many options to solve your requirements    I just stay for 3 nights and always find a solution to anything that I require great location and also the access to Tram gives you more options
40,We have always loved the location of the hotel. A few things we don’t like is the remodel of the rooms has a sliding door used for both the closet and bathroom which is odd. Also I miss the days when they had a refrigerator and left water in the rooms for their guests.
10,I am a Pearl M Life player. I stayed at Park MGM for 1 night on a special player's offer. I have stayed at many hotels in Las Vegas and I have never had such a terrible experience. I requested a high floor with a view which of couse is based on availability. I was given room 319 on the 3rd floor with a view of an a/c ventilation system roof covered with trash and tools. The room was very basic and NOT clean. I wish I had pictures. This property was recently completely renovated and I expected much better. The corner of the bed was like an animal had chewed it. There was a nasty black comb on a wash cloth in the bathroom and cup of water with trash in it under the TV. I called housekeeping. Eventually they came and took the comb and trash with no explantion no apology and no offer to move rooms. I wondered if the sheets had even been changed? Thankfully it was only 1 night. This was my first and last stay at Park MGM. Please bring back Monte Carlo. I will stay at other M Life properties but never again at Park MGM.
10,I love staying at Staywell rooms at MGM Grand. The Staywell rooms at Park MGM are are not up to the same standards. The bed was hard and the shower was missing the infuser. There is also no private check in for Staywell at Park like at the Grand.
50,Excellence Customer Service staff was very Friendly Helpful and attentive to your needs. House Keeping keep the rooms very clean and had very good service. The location was a Big plus very close to everything and the Restaurants had ver good food.
50,From Chek Inn to check out everything was wonderful. It was so easy checking in the room was ready the location of the hotel was perfect the Eataly we enjoyed so much ate there almost every day. I can’t think of anything bad.
50,Everything was great! It was clean staff was great casino layout was easy to navigate. Awesome location. Was within walking distance to other places I wanted to visit on the strip. I would highly recommend this resort
30,"mgm charges a high resort fee and gives you internet that is slow and breaks down constantly. no reasonable priced places to eat and their ""cafe"" is never open. check in is very slow and services are under staffed. only stay here because it was comp'd room"
50,A fantastic makeover! The marketplace is to die for the variety of food and wine is amazing. Eataly is a little bit of Italy placed in Vegas for all to indulge...actually to overindulge lol Highly recommended and can't wait to return for a repeat of this food pleasure land
40,The place is nice with restaurant options. I like the easy check-in and check out process. I can do it from the TV. The staff are all friendly. I liked Eataly for the coffee options I got. At lavazza the staff was extra excepcional.
50,Absolutely loved this hotel! Beautiful hotel casino with lots to do. Great location on the strip. Hotel staff were very helpful and kind. Very clean room. Great pool area so many restaurants to choose from. We will definitely stay here again!
40,We found the hotel easy to navigate and great for our group to easily meet up. We would have preferred to have an in room coffee option but appreciated the free refill until noon at the restaurant in the lobby area. Very friendly staff.
50,This is the old Monte Carlo.....totally different after remodel! Great place to stay on the strip restaurants galore and Eataly is amazing! The gambling options here are pretty good drinks at the bars were great and the staff here is fantastic! The only thing to be aware of.....there are no fridges in the room. So if you're buying any waters or snacks that you want cold that wont happen. Other than that this place is stellar!
40,This was a very good place to stay for a great group rate. I had only one issue regarding the Housekeeper not waiting long enough for me to respond before just opening my door. Also the T-Mobile Arena is right next door so when they scored a goal there is a loud buzzer that I could hear in my room like I was outside. That didn't bother me but it may bother others.
40,We were in town for an event and stayed at The Park MGM because it was central and reasonably priced. Nice room and friendly staff. They were very helpful in getting us two adjacent rooms for our family. Highly recommend!
50,Park MGM provided excellent service from time I pulled in valet to receiving assistance when checking in at kiosk and helpful bell person. My room looked newly remodeled and was very nice. MGM Park exceeded my expectations
50,If your looking for a place to relax this is the place for you. The hotel is in a great location to just enjoy a nice relaxing stay in Vegas. If you are looking for a hotel closer to the action this is not the hotel for you. The spa at the park is a bit small but amazing you will not want to leave. The park is worth every penny spent.
50,Didn't know what to expect the rates were so reasonable. We upgraded to a staywell room and were impressed by the effort to make a healthy serene environment. Helpful friendly staff Bavette's steakhouse and Eatly were other pluses.
40,A belated Christmas present of sorts there was no disappointment. Everyone extremely helpful pleasant and excellent Park MGM representatives. Plenty of dining choices. We had dinner at the Nomad Restaurant and it was excellent as one would expect. And who doesn't like Eataly?
30,First stay at Park MGM; will be the last. The rooms were not comparable to other MGM properties I have stayed at. Paid to be upgraded to bigger room. Both rooms had been recently upgraded we were told. Not a fan of the red velvet couches or the strange wall decor.
20,Our stay was ok we had flooding in the bathroom shower the last night. We waited for someone to fix it it was never fixed. Went to check out and mentioned to staff the issue regarding the shower they were surprised to hear no one came to fix/look at the shower but did nothing about the issue still waiting for management to rectify the issue
50,We loved our stay at Park MGM. The facilities and staff were amazing! The location is great! It was easy for us to attend activities near by. We loved the Eataly. We would definitely stay there again.
30,Not happy was promised something’s we did not get. Bed was not very comfortable. The noise from the hall and adjoining rooms very loud. We hav stayed in other MGM properties and may do again. We will stay at the Park MGM.
10,way over priced and very dissapointed in service and the quality of the hotel itself. they are out to take your money and not looking out for the customer. extra charges for everything. room was dirty not vacuumed bathroom not cleaned..
50,Previously i stayed here when it first became PARK MGM and was not a good experience. However this time around was exceptional. Great service easy check in wonderful room and staff was awesome in all areas.
30,"The Hotel itself is cool because of ""Eataly "" but rooms are average and MLife was what really bothered me this trip. Long lines and little knowledge along with poor customer service. Excellent service at valets and front desk. Great food slots were not tight."
50,Good service and great people and everything is good great day for you guys look at me like me that's what I'm gonna be like for a while and I'm so sorry but you don't have children's pictures and they are so much more than I can say that they are so cute but it's okay if I can tell me what time they are going for the smog in the morning or something else I will let them go back 6PM or something and you can just get a good idea to make sure that you have the same thing and I have a fillings for you that I was trying not to get mad when 3
50,Service was great and the massage therapist did a really great job on relieving pain from my lower back. Lala noodles was awesome. Their staff was very nice and friendly. My wife also loved the attention she was given at the salon
50,Totally enjoyed our trip!!!!!!!! Perfect trip except for the cancellation of the Cher concert! But the rest made up for it! We loved the Blake Shelton concert and enjoyed our dining in the hotel love Noodles and Bavettes!
10,Stay somewhere else! An old hotel with some lipstick on it. Hookers openly soliciting clients. A great location but the rooms are small just updated but still an old hotel that should have been imploded.
50,Hotel is great! Nice rooms and location. Only downside is property still charges 24 dollars a night to park valet. Almost all other properties have abandoned that policy. Other than that the hotel gets 5 stars!
40,Hotel and restaurants were amazing but the room and housekeeping were lacking. Having Eately downstairs was awesome for a load of interesting foods and drinks but the issues fell on the room and housekeeping. Got soiled sheets (seems like they didn't replace them between guests) asked to replace them we came back to the same sheets but just a remade bed. Had to ask again for them to be completely replaced.
40,Arrived at the hotel around 02pm and the room was not ready even though I did the pre check-in online. The staff asked me to do it again at the check-in kiosks and wait for one hour to get a message saying that the keys would be ready to pick up. I waited until 06pm and when I went to the VIP desk to get them to my surprise they didn't have any available rooms ready from the category I had booked.
40,I had stayed here on multiple occasions when it was called the Monte Carlo and enjoyed the stays each time. I had noticed that it was I need of a renovation so when it became the Park MGM and was fully renovated I was excited to stay again. I was in for a letdown as I had been expecting more. Basic reno with new paint and new carpeting. Otherwise not much done in the rooms. The casino was much better than before and had a hipper vibe to it. Either way you still can't beat the location.
40,All was good.Property is amazing and well connected to the strip.However the service part ..might need to push up a little.Casino was good too.But make sure if you are unwell and need basic things like hot water...don’t expect hotel to help you.Thy will like charge irrational money just for the hot water.Otherwise there self checkin checkout was amazing.They allowed us early checkin too.
10,Paid $100 for room. $44 at check out. But I still got $88 extra charge on my card for no reason. I been to Paris or ceaser the charge on them was final mgm park guys not. Refund the extra you have charged.
50,Park MGM made it all happen again second year in a row. Great location. Great staff. Housekeeping spot on. Primrose Restaurant fantastic breakfast! Elevators perfect location in center by lobby. Not a mile away. Cant' say enough good things. Great rooms. Park MGM the place to be.
20,Check in was easy once I got out of the long M Life VIP check in line and used a kiosk. The hotel is pretty standard. Rooms were decent the shower was the best part of the room. No refrigerator in the room. Was dissapointed the spa didn’t open until 830 that’s the latest I’ve seen at any hotel. There was no room service menu so I had to call to find out it where was the operator tried to explain the menu was on the tv but it was not in the hotel series section so they sent a menu to my room. I order an omelette fruit plate and granola yogurt. When it got to my room it came in paper to go containers never seen this at any hotel. The toast was Cold inedible and they threw one piece of bread in a to go container the omelette was worst omelette I’ve ever had very small with only bits of pre packaged ham and WHITE CHEESE I couldn’t eat it. The fruit plate was pathetic the yogurt and granola were good and my orange juice came in a small plastic bottles $90 with tip for a breakfast I would expect at a motel 6. Will not be staying here again.
40,Great location very friendly valet bell staff restaurant staff dealers. Didn’t feel the usual snootiness Vegas hotels are usually known for. The check is quick and efficient via self check in/check out kiosks which are great! Food choices are fairly slim at the hotel but Eataly is a great place to try a variety of Italian foods in a casual open setting and was a great experience for us. The rooms are clean and spacious albeit a little plain but the beds and linens were comfortable. Nothing fancy but it is in a great location on the strip and the price point is great for a quick trip to Vegas.
30,Don't like that there is a resort fee and then tax on it. When I made the reservation it said there may be a resort fee. Why not just tell me up front I'm paying $42 more each night? Also have to pay for parking. It was $15/day not terrible. But I am a paying guest; it should be included and again would like to know that up front. The walls are thin! We could hear the people next door talking coughing their alarm their TV! The doors slam super loudly when shutting. It's Vegas people are in and out at all different hours. We didn't plan on sleeping in but we did want to get some sleep. Our room didn't have a fridge nor a coffee maker. And why are all the pillows big and fat? Would like there to be some differentiation. Not everyone likes to sleep with their head propped up like that. There was no shampoo conditioner nor body wash in our room. We had to find a housekeeper and ask for it. Last time we stayed at Park MGM it was fantastic. This time not so much.  At Eataly there should be a separate line if you just want a cappuccino. Skipped it because the line was the same as for ordering food and was ridiculously long to wait in. Items were on the shelves not in relation to their price / item. Couldn't find the items the labels were for. For both purchases I made the transactions were done wrong (by the cashier) and had to be cancelled and redone.  On a positive note like the location of Park MGM the staff was congenial and the room was very clean.
50,So easy to check in and check out! All you need is your ID and it will take you to your reservation pop out your room key and a print out of your room number nice for security reasons. Rooms are extremely nice and the art work is COOL!!!
30,Requested a room with a tub and view and got a shower and a room with a view of a little of the strip and lots of view of the rooftop. The room was hot every time I returned and I was told by the staff the a/c is sensorsed to turn OFF every time you leave and there is no motion detection. That is insane. Can only imagine how hot it is in the summer. This alone would keep me from staying there again.
40,No fridge in the room? Tiny bureau in the closet. No hotel “menu book” in the room. Impossible to order room service if you wanted to. Rooms were clean and bed/pillows excellent and very comfy. Also excellent tv menu. There is a safe in the closet which is important.
20,Check in was at 3pm when we arrived at 2:30 were told the room wouldn’t be available until 3pm which we knew and that was fine. Well room wasn’t ready until 4:30pm. When we asked about our room at 3:30 were told by 4 the hotel has to find us a room of equal status or an upgrade for no charge. At 4pm I went to ask the concierge desk who I could talk to since the woman at the VIP check in did not seem concerned with our lack of rooms. He was the rudest person I had ever had the displeasure of speaking with. He did not even let me make a complete sentence before cutting me off and only repeating about 5 times “I can’t help you with that.” At the VIP desk the woman was almost as displeasant and stated that should would give us a room that was considered a down grade from the one I had booked ( we booked a king size “wellness” room and she was going to offer a queen bed room with no “wellness) and assured me “there would be no charge for the difference”. I declined stating I would hope being given a downgrade wouldn’t cost me more. I asked if there was anyone else I could speak with and she stated “I don’t know”. After 20 seconds of us staring at one another I went back to wait for the room. When the room was ready there was no acknowledgement of the hour wait we had due to hotel mistake. The decor was boring. The room was no different than any other room. Nothing special about the room. When blow drying my hair the breaker would go out and I’ve have to take breaks for it to click back on. This was underwhelming to say the least.
50,As I mentioned everything was great start to finish. I really enjoyed my stay and will certainly consider staying here again. Although I did not win any money haha!    I’m in data collection l my one suggestion would be to not force respondents to type 200 characters per open end!    Thank you!
50,The location of the hotel is ideal on the strip and the rooms were well maintained and clean. Would definitely recommend to anyone wanting to stay here. Cant wait to return to Vegas again very very soon!
30,I liked everything about the hotel expect for the rooms and the amount of smoke in the hotel. The room was just ok nothing special. What really made me mad was you have to pay $35 to have a fridge in your room! The view pretty good. The bed was actually amazing. Slept like a log on it. Hotel had way to much cigarette smoke in it. It doesn't necessarily bother me it just had way more than any other hotel that I went into. Food in the Eatitaly was really good.
30,This place is a work in progress at least at the end of February. They were literally replacing carpet in the main hallways both nights we stayed. Location is good if you are going to the arena. There are few amenities in the rooms-no coffee maker was a major disappointment but there's a Starbucks in the lobby.
50,Everyone was friendly and treated you like a person not a vacationer... Rooms were very clean view was great... Food is out of this world in Lala noodles the sports book and Eataly... Casino floor staff and bar staff were the most friendly of any mgm resort I've been to in Vegas ... This will be my only hotel I stay at forward..
50,This hotel is wonderful we always enjoy our stay here and highly recommend to family and friends! Beautiful decor wonderful restaurants comfortable rooms and fun casino make it our #1 hotel in Vegas!
30,I'v had several stays at this property (Monty Carlo) in the past twenty years for business entertainment and vacations but this was my second stay post remodel/rename. Would be tough to have a next time.
40,"This was my 2nd time using the Park MGM. The first time was back in September 2018. My review from then was removed because of the ""renovations"" even though the rooms were done at that point.    The hotel/casino is recently renovated over the last couple of years transforming it from the Monte Carlo into the Park MGM.    Throughout the hotel there is some unique artwork including in the rooms. The room we were in had some old post cards as artwork. Because all of this is a mix and match it gives a uniqueness.    The room was a very decent size with a comfortable bed and updated bathroom. My biggest complaint about the room is the air conditioning (same complaint I had last time) the room gets stuffy after a while. My other complaint about the room is the TV volume would reset to being very loud whenever it was turned back on always had to adjust the volume down to a reasonable level after changing channels.    Check-in was easy. We did precheck-in online before getting to Las Vegas. There is mostly only kiosks in the lobby for self check-in those who have status with MGM will find the VIP Check-in off to the side. Check-out is handled the same way.    It was convenient to walk to NY NY the Aria and having the ""tram"" to take over to the Bellagio. There is now a bridge in front to cross LV Boulevard.    There is a couple of restaurants and bars inside. Unfortunately no buffet and no ""fast food""/value options."
30,We only stayed one night at the Park MGM and were a bit disappointed. I think we were given this room because I requested early check in. Which we paid for. The room was on the 7th floor overlooking the roof with air conditioning units . The safe in the room was broken .The room did not have a refrigerator. The bed was comfy and clean.The bathroom was clean also.
50,This hotel is central and has great places to eat. Right across the street from the T-Mobile arena where the Vegas nights play. Lots of restaurants in walking distance and a free tram back-and-forth to the Bellagio. Staff is very friendly and the casino is a decent size. My husband and I would definitely stay here again.Would highly recommend this hotel to anyone.
50,Although we were in Vegas for business & pleasure it was my first trip with friends & loved my experience. We had adjoining rooms with two per room & had a blast. We would definitely return to Vegas & do this again
50,I stayed there in the past when it was the Monte Carlo and I am impressed with all the upgrades. Everyone was so helpful and I was very pleased with my stay. I will definitely be staying there again..
50,Park MGM RE/MAX Trip my office was there for our annual awards ceremony that we have every year at the end of February. We look foward to Las Vegas & our awards ceremony at the MGM. We have nothing but an amazing experience everytime. Thank you!
50,Park MGM is the hotel to stay at when in Las Vegas. Excellent service and staff. Very convenient location. Walking distance to hear by casinos and shopping is a bonus at this hotel. Can't wait to go back again.
10,By service issues I mean there is no service. Literally you are on your own when you arrive at the lobby. Everything is digitized with very little information to direct you in the right direction. There are a couple employees walking around with iPads who are disconnected from the idea that they have one job and it's to provide service.    In a city with many people a low number of poor servicemen becomes problematic. As for the actual hotel it was hard to relax. Resort prices with a budget feel away from the Strip. I highly recommend you do not to test it for yourself. If there is another hotel you are considering even with a rating in the 3's move in that direction.    Apologize for no pictures. I typically have a few with any of my stays but did not have the desire to take any.
20,Memory foam mattress was quite hard. Either mattress or sheets or combination held in heat and both my guest and I woke up drenched in sweat. Additionally our room was not ready upon our arrival at 6pm.
50,The hotel was great and right on the strip with easy access to other casinosBy East her walking or a convenient (Free) tram toward the back of the hotel. Also the Eataly portion of the hotel is amazing and a definite must visit whether staying at the park mgm or not.
50,family trip for new years eve! just in time to check in eat dinner and chill before going out to the strip to watch the fireworks! awesome spot  in front of the park mgm and not as crazy as we expected.. crowded but not crazy
40,I stayed here in early February and had stayed in the same location numerous times when it was still the Monte Carlo. While it is nice and reasonably priced it could use some updating. It seems like they didn't do a lot to update it when they changed to Park MGM.    Pros:  - Great central location  - Eataly in casino  - Computer check-in which was surprisingly easy  - Great restaurant for brunch (Primrose)  - Generally clean rooms    Cons:  - Bathroom door is weird. It's a barn door (slides) so it doesn't actually shut fully or lock. Plus the same door is shared with the closet so you can't have the closet door and bathroom door both closed at the same time or open at the same time. A very weird design choice  - Room is general could use updating/upgrading. Old kinda grungy carpet and furniture  - No buffet brunch (a vegas staple)
20,Rooms and beautiful location is great- service of their staff is horrible- reward center and cafe service was unacceptable. I will not stay there again. The hostess at the cafe was so rude and when we spoke to the manager she said she would talk to her and didn’t even care. And then at reward center I asked the lady to add my M life points to my room and her first words were... “first of all you booked it on Expedia And because you choose the cheap way- you don’t get your points” I was speechless- I’m my head I was like so she’s calling me poor because I choose Expedia? Okay- so I make 200k a year but “first of all” I’m broke- okay- bye.
40,"The room was obviously newly refurbished and very modern but I disliked the lack of a real closet and dresser space as well as absolutely no place to put your toiletries in the bathroom nor anywhere to stash your suitcase. Housekeeping was adequate though one day they simply did not empty one of the trash containers. Food was good but overpriced (it is Vegas after all).    Check in and checkout was a horror. The Kiosks are useless and if you have any problem they direct you to the ""VIP"" desk which is understaffed and has round the clock long lines. I am still waiting for a credit to post to my Amex as they messed up my original charge. How difficult is it to evenly split the cost of a room between two credit cards?    On the bright side it was clean conveniently located with a nice casino. It was also priced reasonable compares to some other options. I really want to give it 3.5 stars."
50,Located in middle of strip with easy parking beautiful rooms great service & great views from just about every room. Great showers in rooms with comfortable beds & big screen swing out TVs so you can watch from all angles
50,Booked this hotel for the Wilder v Fury fight and the hotel wasn't a primary concern when booking but friends had stayed before and we had a good recommendation.    I previously have stayed in the Wynn Encore so I am very much of the view that expectations should fit the price you pay. If you want opulence then the Wynn Bellagio etc etc are the hotels for you.    If you want a hotel that would probably still be 4 or 5 stars in most countries then the MGM Park is ideal.    The location of the hotel is great with it being close to the MGM Grand and you can also get a free tram to the Aria and Bellagio.    Taxi for the airport was $23 and took about 20 minutes. Like most of the previous reviews I think the automated check-in was problematic in that we had to get help two to three times as the system couldn't find us. However I imagine like all technology those things will get better.    The room was very clean had a tv safe iron and a few drinks and snacks if required.    The facilities at the hotel were good with the outdoor pool and onsite shops for food and snacks and then a few restaurants. The Eatery at the end of the hotel and a wide range of food available and we often ate there for breakfast.. not the cheapest but like most places in Vegas everything seems so overpriced.    The Casino was good we mainly played the fruit machines which seemed to pay well in the mornings and seemed to pay better the than other Casinos we went to.    The only downside to Las Vegas is that you can smoke anywhere and whilst I understand from a business perspective you don't want to lose gamblers because they need to smoke all of my clothes stank of smoke and given a choice I would prefer a non smoking environment. However....it's Vegas so take it or leave it!!!    Overall a great hotel for the money as well above my expectations vs the price paid.
40,Overall exceeded my expectations however I knew going in it wasn't 5 star property. Room was adequate quite small but dont spend anytime there anyways. Casino was nice size and dealers were generally excellent with a good vibe overall. Eataly was by far the highlight the food was fantastic with lots of variety ...great place for coffee in the am as well
20,We booked this hotel since it has recently been renovated. The hotel is beautiful however the renovations missed the mark. When you arrive you are forced to check in using a kiosk. That would be fine but there too many problems and it did not work appropriately using our Driver’s License to locate our reservation. A staff member had to assist with our check in several times due to all problems. Since you check in with a kiosk there is no customer service to give you important information needed. No one told us we needed our room key to use the elevator and access our floor. We reserved a King bed room but due to problems with the kiosk there was no king showing available through the kiosk so they manually assigned us an accessible king room. We got to our room and decided to unpack. This room did not have a dresser or drawers for clothes storage. We called the front desk and they moved us to a regular King room. This room had one small narrow drawer organizer in the closet. There was not much counter space in the bathroom and no storage in the bathroom for toiletries. Their main eating option is Eatly. It is beautiful but it is a fancy food court and the food was a bit more exotic for our taste. We wanted do sit down and have wait staff service as opposed to ordering at a counter waiting on the food and then finding a place to sit. We go to Las Vegas every year and this hotel missed the mark for us. This hotel may be ok if you plan to stay one night or don’t care if you live out of a suitcase. There was a dental floss pick on the floor in the elevator lobby on our floor for two days which indicates the floors aren’t vacuumed daily. We will choose another hotel next year.
40,Convenient Location - easy access to freeway and located on the strip near everything. Rooms are nice new and clean. Casino has lots of options and availability. Restaurants were ok but not wonderful.
40,We stayed at this place because it was arranged through a NASCAR race tour package that we did. Because this hotel was remodeled just a couple of years ago it's still quite clean. The room layout is very nice. Big TVs nice walk in showers couch with pillows by the windows lots of power outlets for recharging your electronics. Lots of housekeeping people around at any time. Check-in and check-out process we're both done with self checking kiosks and went very smoothly. We had no problems here.
50,Park MGM Las Vegas was Fabulous! It was a Girls Get A Way Stay and we had the best time ever! The location is perfect for a concert at the Park Theatra or the T-Mobile Center. The restaurants bars and casino was ALL Perfect! Our only negative was there was no coffee marker or little fridge in the room. However Starbucks was on the ground level.
40,Stayed here for a fun birthday weekend & experienced the Park and its surrounding bar/restaurant options (from Eatly to Best Friends from Vegas Knights to the Heavyweight Fight) the energy and ambiance was exciting. . .the Park MGM has it all and if you're looking for a good and relaxing time this is your place.
30,Strong Smell in our room. Parking is an extra cost on top of resort fee. Daily. At check in it's a kiosk no one to answer any questions. It's nice that they offer early check in if they have a room ready
30,The rooms were lacking the bed was uncomfortable and no glasses or cup of any kind in the room. Towels were old and there was dirty towel in closet when we checked in however housekeeping did a good job after that.
20,"I've stayed at this location when it was Monte Carlo multiple times and always loved it. Restaurants were great and rooms were comfortable. Well using comps I stayed here for 2 nights. I am SO disappointed in the changes they made. The restaurants are expensive the ""food court"" Eataly is way overpriced and you can't get regular products such as soda or water... all Italian brands. I usually stay at MLife properties because of my points I had a bunch of issues with the games reading and not reading points here. There is no check in desk ... everything is done on a tablet!!!    On a positive side ... the rooms are spacious and updated. They joined other casinos in the barn door no lock bathroom look. The location is very good ... right by TMobile so great for games and events. The tram in the back to Bellagio saves a lot of steps too. The staff seems quite average was not overly impressed with anything at this property."
50,It was a nice time for a get-away! The weather was perfect. The check-in process was easy the room was ready the suite was absolutely amazing!! Would I return??? I certainly would!! You should give it a try. There's a tram that can take you down to Bellagio with stops in between.
50,If you're ever in Vegas have never been please look up the Park MGM the staff is very Professional and quick to help with any need..... The gym is awesome if you like to workout.. State of the art equipment...The Steakhouses is out of this world....
30,If you are looking to gamble and drink you may want to find another casino.  Dont expect the wait staff to be friendly and complaints to fall on deaf ears. I really feel with the money that was spent I wish I had stayed at another Casino.
50,No issues with the room it was great.went during the week and had to leave on Fiday. Noise level could have been a little quieter. i found the check-in experience was a breeze however had to manually check-out since i had incurred some charges.
20,Arrived 1030pm to be told it would take 30-40 mins to get room ready or take a different room than was booked. Wasn’t cleaned properly or often. Resort fees charged on checkout that I was not aware of.
30,Great location but you only get the bare necessities. No place for clothing (4 small drawers in closet for 4 people) no mini fridge no coffee machine no replenishing of soaps glasses ice bucket bags etc.
10,Reserved a room weeks in advance. Checked in 24 hours before. Got to hotel and they said our room was given away and we should have read the fine print about it. That they were too busy and that even though I had checked in via the app and reserved the room that I had no guarantee this was going to be my room. It was either take what they offered me or not stay there at all. If your staying in Vegas don’t waste your time checking into this old hotel that doesn’t care about their guests.
30,Hotel was ok. Thought a little pricey for room. But location pretty good on strip. Eataly restaurant was really good sports book to small. Casino ok not as good as Belagio. Pool was in shade most of day so not much sun.
30,"We are long-time guests of the Monte Carlo. While that property needed a facelift this one has gone in the wrong direction. I've stayed here twice since the name change and ""upgrades"" and have been disappointed overall."
30,We booked this hotel for the sole reason of seeing Cher there in concert. Minutes before arriving to the theater from our $ dinner we saw signs that said that the concert was canceled. Zero explanation. The only reason we stayed at this hotel was to be at the concert location. So that was a bummer. Hotel said and did nothing for any of the concert goers.    But back to the hotel and casino. Check in was quick and easy using the kiosks. Our room was not ready until the check-in time of three. So we gambled until then. We had lunch at Eataly which was great (we also have that in Los Angeles.) Pizza was really good. We got a text when our room was ready so that was nice.    When we went up to our room on the third floor we thought the hallways were really dark. As women we’re not huge fans of that especially when we are coming back up at 2am alone. We got to our room and it was pretty small. Incredibly plain. No-frills nothing fancy. We had an OK view of the New York New York roller coaster. The beds were super soft which was great. The bathroom was really clean. But that’s about it for the room. We don’t really spend much time in the room in Vegas anyway.    The casino seemed way more smoky than Bellagio where we usually stay. Room service menu is super basic and limited. We came up to the room at 1am hungry and passed on ordering anything.    One huge bummer is when we were coming back up to the room for a quick change at night the elevator door opened from the lobby and there was a ton of fresh vomit on the floor. So grossed out we skipped that elevator and moved onto the next one. But then as we were walking on the third floor towards our room another huge pile of fresh vomit was on the floor close to our room. So that was completely disgusting. But to the hotel’s credit when we left again 15 minutes later not one ounce of vomit was anywhere. They cleaned it up super quickly which we appreciated.    Check out was easy too. Used the kiosk again. We had breakfast at Primrose and that was good.    The fact that we stayed there solely because of a concert that was cancelled right before... huge bummer. This hotel is just fine. Nothing great.
30,The rooms are fairly modern but still a little dated. Hallways are so dark and out dated. The casino is basic but nice. The key for us is the location it is right across from T-Mobile arena. The bars are lacking and food was not available after 11:30 in the main area.
50,Excellent hotel with clean and comfortable room. Great restaurants and amenities. Location is excellent with easy access to the strip and rides - busses and tram also other casinos/ hotels. Great times
10,Much better deals from any neighboring resort. Services not available when needed. Front desk personnel were rude and of no help at all to the point of being combative on the phone when asking a simple question. We have been going to Vegas yearly for the past ten years. Worst experience we have had.
30,Not satisfied with how my family was treated during self check in. The man acted like he was bothered he had to help us with our check in. I couldn't figure out my room number and he pointed to it on my email like I was a complete idiot. I will never recommend this business if he still works there. disrespectful in every way
20,We came to vegas to see Cher her show was cancelled and that is all understandable. But to us the Hotel has some sort of responsibility to give guests something. Especially when we came all this way to your hotel because of the concert
30,The location was the best part of the hotel. It is right across the street from the arena. The room was very basic too basic. It did not have a refrigerator not even a coffee maker. The $13.00 Evian water was warm begging the question who would pay for warm water. The concierge closed at 8:00 pm and there is no front desk. You check-in and out through a computer self check out. The bathroom was clean the bed was adequate and the pillows were good. The casino does not have any poker but the dealers at the blackjack tables were friendly and helpfully patient with beginners.
20,Traveled across the US to see a concert they advertised and spent thousands between flights and hotel and it was canceled and we were given zero compensation for the wasted trip. They should comp at least a night stay or something to make up for all the money we lost for a trip to see a show that never happened
10,We stayed at this property for only one night. The TV didn’t work at all. No movies. No regular programming. The rooms are very spartan and look like they need a serious remodel even though it was just completed. Definitely not worth the cost. I absolutely do NOT recommend this property for any sort of trip.
40,Pretty building; great automated check-in experience; great Spartan Euro-feel room with a good bed. Great hotel layout. The slots were too tight and felt like an awful deal from the bettor's perspective; it'd be better if it took longer to lose your stash. Eataly was a disappointment because there were no whole-grain options for either the pasta or the pizza crust. We'll be back though!
30,Reserved a strip view when I checked in wasn’t available. Parks was supposed to give me a strip view the following day but didn’t receive a call. Not compensated or anything & was charged same price. Room is just ok. No fridge or microwave in room. Definitely could use a fridge. I only drink water. Won’t stay again!!
40,This casino resort has been rebranded from former monte carlos. it has the park theater so singing artist such as Ricky Martin Cher and others can be seen. They have a few luxory/ yuppie places to eat - note no buffets and some of these restraunts you have to reserve. the begining of the entrance its a small italy - note its called Eataly haha. have meats seafood and drinks for all those interested.
50,Stayed in the Stay Well room! It had aromatherapy diffuser memory foam mattress air purifier with mood enhancer ambiance/circadian lighting and Vitamin C infused shower!! It was spectacular! Very relaxing and fun!!!
20,I would not recommend this hotel. We had problems with the tv to where we had to unplug cable box many times. Also no refrigerator so if you had food left over you have to throw it away. Very disappointed.
10,We woke up and my fiancé was looking for his phone and found a condom under his pillow. We called down to the front desk and we were given free parking and resort fee waiver. We went down to talk to the manager and were offered breakfast which we had no interest in as we were both disgusted and had no desire to eat. So the manager applied a 50 dollar credit to our bill. So we paid $86 for the room. On the way home we had 5 hours to think about this. And i wouldn’t have booked an unclean room that I know someone had sex in the sheets I were to sleep in for $86. Why is that the resolution. Disgusting. So unhappy about this experience.
40,A dramatic improvement in quality over the old Monte Carlo. The rooms are new modern and efficient for the tech gear traveler today. The food quality is excellent but the restaurants are expensive no buffet for breakfast but there is one next door at the Areia. but be prepared for flexible pricing $38.99 weekend brunch $28.99 week day brunch (slightly lower before 9:00 AM) food quality is excellent. Great location to see an NHL hockey game at T-Mobile arena or an in house concert at the Park MGM theater.
50,Excellent stay. Clean rooms friendly staff and close to T-Mobile and access to the strip and teams to travel. Also liked Uber could pick you up and drop you off at the front doors. Would definitely stay here again and recommend to others.
30,The room was good. We did book a king size bed room but got a room with 2 queen size beds. We did not complain but the room could have been used to its max if it were given to a family of 4. Check in was fairly easy.
50,everyone was so helpful no matter what we wanted to do Rian Nesbitt was great at setting our tours up for us very friendly clean rooms i would stay there again meet people that came from all over the U.S. that work there and alot came from New York
20,"The check in at this resort is supposed to be super modern and automated as you use a machine to check in basically. However during this process you have to enter a lot of information such as your address and e-mail which of course you've already provided when you originally made the booking. When I finally completed this automated check in I was told my room was not yet ready but that I would receive an e-mail when it was ready. Of course I never received this e-mail with the QR code necessary to get my room key so I had to get help from staff to get my key once my room was ready.    I had booked a King Strip View room from a great deal on hotels.com with a rate of about $110 for my one-night stay which was very reasonable. However upon check out I was charged an additional $41.95 ""resort fee"". Almost half the room rate itself! Absolutely ridiculous especially since I have no idea what this resort fee included as this type of information is usually provided at check in.    My room was a bit on the small side (especially for Vegas) and it had a rather pathetic mini bar with a choice of three Fiji Waters Pringles Oreos Kit Kat minis and some cashews. That was it. There was no fridge with drinks - or for storing your own.    The room was strictly speaking facing the Strip as promised but for the most part you could only see a big roof and then the Strip and the MGM Grand in the distance. Since the hotel is not actually on the Strip there is no way to get a ""real"" view of the Strip. I did enjoy the couch by the window where you could sit and look out.    The decor of the room was a bit odd. Weird pictures on the walls and a funky red color on one of the walls. I will say that the bathroom was quite nice though.    The TV and the picture quality was good and the WiFi also worked fine.    The hotel itself is not as impressive as the others on the actual Strip. I don't think the dining choices were very impressive for once and the shop near the lobby didn't have many selections in terms of food and snacks for example. Service from staff also wasn't particularly good.    One of the few things I liked about the resort was the fact that you could easily walk from the room to the Park Theater where I had tickets for an Aerosmith concert that night. The venue and the concert was great!    Overall there are so many better hotels in Vegas. In a city where some of the biggest hotels in the world are located and where the competition is so fierce the relatively new Park MGM has a long way to go."
20,at first wehn you walk in its great BUT then you check in and get hit with a 400$ resort fee when i last checked resorts have pools and buffets NOT like our experience 1 pool was open cant bring any personal booze into the pool but when you get here come on and buy a 15 dollar beer seems like a great idea only 1 pool was opened then the fact that theres no buffets but all other hotels have one and if you went to the primrose you pay 70 for uncooked eggs and a watered down mimosa Concierage was a joke asked for some help with tickets to the knights game and they said the best they can do was above face value thanks for nothing
20,The room color scheme appears to be green or red. You have to see it. Ugh-lee.    The hallways are not well lit (considering how bright modern LED lights are it was awfully dark - reminded me of a 40W incandescent light bulb [no idea what was actually behind the light shades]).    The ceilings are low (beware if you are claustrophobic).    There is very little sink counter top space.    The room reminded me of sprayed insecticide (or maybe that was the aroma they were trying to achieve?).    The beds were quite low to the floor (tricky if getting up is normally a challenge).    In the two queen room (28th floor no less) there is one round table. That's it. If you need table space you will not find it. Unlike other hotels there is no dresser top that you could put stuff on (unless you wanted to use the one that was IN the closet).    Closet space was the smallest I've ever seen (by far) for two queens.    There is a very long sofa bench next to the small room window. You could in theory sleep two kids on it. Or one adult. But not two adults. They don't have roll-aways (so don't even think about asking).
40,A very moderately priced and new hotel on the MGM side of the strip. Moderate selection of restaurants but a great Eatly food court. Must try the selection of dried meats and cheeses pasta and seafood. LA LA Noodle is also a must try. Primrose is just OK and could be avoided..
40,The staff was very helpful. The room was nicely decorated. The shower was wonderful with great water pressure. The Eataly was very good with so many choices. You can catch the Las Vegas Monorail right across the street at MGM Grand.
50,Outstanding resort hotel. Perfect location on the strip. Located right next to t mobile arena. Food options in the hotel were incredible. Easy access to everything on the strip. Would gladly stay here again.
10,There was no coffee in the rooms. It seems like they overbooked the hotel and offer only a few restaurants to eat at. I was not satifisfied with this hotel and will not be back. I expect better service in Vegas.
10,Entire property is outdated and carpet was stained and dirty. Feminine pad wrapper in drawer and hair in sink upon check-in. Room service delivered in boxes with plastic utensils. Not worth our time or money. Thin walls. Would never recommend. Checked out and went to another hotel immediately!
50,I have enjoyed staying at ParkMGM. It is a fun place to stay and the rooms are very comfortable. The Italian Eatry is exciting because of the different type of foods that are available. The no hassle check in is awesome.
40,Stayed at Park MGM for the Aerosmith concert and found it to be very nice and dog friendly but room amenities could be better (coffee maker please!). The staff and service were great and it was incredibly convenient to walk through the casino and right into the concert venue. The bars (especially Juniper and it's host Lenny) were awesome and staff on the casino floor were giving away 2 for 1 drink tickets every day which were a blessing as cocktails are pricey but no one mentioned we couldn't use them on event nights until after the bill came. The small print is too small to read late at night when you are trying to have a good time lol! There is an Eataly on the property which was so fantastic we loved it! And the Lady Gaga museum (free) is not to be missed!
50,Whenever I come to vegas this is the only hotel I stay at! Park MGM is a beautiful hotel great restaurants and friendly staff. They have a Starbucks inside as well which is super convenient. It's located right across from T mobile arena which makes it the perfect location to walk back to after a Knights game. I also appreciate that the hotel lobby is separates from the casino area so if you have smaller kids that you would like to keep away from cigarette smoke this is perfect.
40,This was our first stay at MGM Park. I booked this room because we were attending the Aerosmith show at the Park Theater. I was a little hesitant based on some mixed reviews and comments about noise but we we very happy overall. We booked the basic king room and got upgraded to a view room in same room type.  Bed and bedding very comfortable interesting artwork modern decor and a great window seating area with table. Bathroom big enough with a great large shower awesome water pressure and funky red tiles. No robes and no mini fridge :( The sliding door for bathroom was a bit interesting bc when opened it acted as a door for the closet. You have to be careful someone isn't in the closet area (ice bucket zone) when you open the bathroom door. I almost squashed my partner once!    If you have a show at Park Theatre I'd recommend staying here for sure. Makes it so much more relaxing. No rushing. Also we noticed they were letting people into the venue from casino with their drinks (probably had to be in plastic cups). Wish we had known this as it would have saved us on drinks at the theater.    Noise only a problem from people in the hallway but that's pretty much the case at the majority of hotels we stay at. We never noticed noise from our neighbors.  Would return for sure.
40,Lobby is very pretty and inviting. Casinos are all smoke filled tho. Hallway to room was very dark and depressing. Room was nice but was not what was pictured. Overall enjoyed our 7 night stay. Property was centrally located so could walk anywhere on the strip very easily.
10,Room needed many upgrades. Bathroom sink drain went down very slow. Left a message for room staff housekeeping etc. to fix but to no avail. The mattress on the bed had a hole in the middle. You sank in the bed.
50,This hotel is located directly across the street from T-Mobile Arena so and is close to so many bars and restaurants. It also didn't seem to be a highly congested area. The room was clean and neat and the restaurant area provided a lot of options.
50,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Park MGM. We had been staying here years ago when this was the Monte Carlo Resort.  The new changes are wonderful especially the “Stay Well” rooms.  We thought that everything about the Stay Well King room we had was great. Too may things to go over but check out their website for this feature.  Enjoyed all of the restaurant options at the complex with the exception of the awful Coffee Shop known as Primrose (see separate review).  We look forward to our next visit and will be back soon!!
10,They may be doing a remodel but I don't think they have remodeled enough of the hotel to be worth bothering with a stay. Poor check in experience and the hall my guest room was located on smelled like wet dog.
50,Stayed for a concert at Park Theater and it was so great to be right at the venue. We had dinner and dessert at Eataly two night in a row because it was that good! Rooom was greta and so was the strip view. The beds were comfortable. Awesome to have Starbucks downstairs.
10,Very disappointed in customer service and cleanliness! Worst hotel in Vegas that I have stayed at. Rude and arrogant staff. No amenities (coffee pot). From management to parking attendant staff no customer service at all.
50,Must see Aerosmith while at the Park MGM in Las Vegas. The experience was great! So easy to stay and play in the same hotel. The Park MGM ( old Monte Carlo) is one of the easiest hotels to navigate. Although they have changed the pools they still looked nice with plenty of seats. ( miss the Lazy River).
40,Great place to stay. The restaurants and the food was great. The staff were professionals. The shower pressure made it nice in the morning. There was no easy USB access and desk. Only a table and chair . That was uncomfortable. But it was very nice place to stay.
50,the over all stay was very nice. everyone was friendley and helpful. the food was Really good. eggs benedict with Crab was the best I have ever had. they made the eggs just how I like them. Everything was clean and neat.
30,Rooms are stark. No coffee maker. Long wait (30 minute plus) to get coffee at Starbucks downstairs. Was very loud. On 14th floor; bands and booms from Hockey stadium. Check in process was very cool; fully automated.
50,Hotel was close to everything but also had everything needed inside... restaurants pools casino shows convenience store lounge fitness space etc. Staff was accessible and helpful. I would recommend.
50,The Park MGM is an excellent customer friendly conveniently located hotel. Outstanding restaurants very clean and quiet rooms as well as comprehensive services offered. I highly recommend this hotel!
50,I always feel as if I've gotten good value for my time and money spent in Park MGM. The location is close to everything fun the property itself is well laid out clean and the staff is attentive to your needs!
40,The rooms are fine the casino is fine. Everything is fine not outstanding but at these room rates it's not supposed to be Aria or Bellagio. Still for having spent millions on the renovations the guest room hallways are way too dark and very creepy. I mainly stay here for the central location the ease of getting in and out of self park and the Eataly located on property. It's an excellent venue (especially the Neapolitan pizza and pasta restaurant).
40,While we've been to Vegas multiple times this was our first stay at the Park MGM. We were in town for a conference and this was the hotel we were put in.    The lobby was beautifully done and is my favorite part of the hotel.    We ended up with a room on the 20th floor with a strip view.    The room was clean and nicely appointed if not just a touch sparse. The pillows were amazing and the beds comfortable enough.    No real negatives to the hotel but certainly not our favorite but I can't fault the Park MGM for us loving NYNY so much.
10,Room service delivered me food with rotten milk. I didnt bother to smell it and drank it not noticing the chunks..... it was disgusting. Other than removing the charge for the room service nobody cared. On top of it no coffee maker or fridge.
10,If you are looking for an expensive self service hotel then this is your spot. Everything is overpriced and no one can help you you have to help yourself. I don't know what happened to providing service for all of the fees that I paid. I won't be returning.
40,Stay was ok. Prefer to stay at aria. Fair stay. Not much option to do for family. Restaurant was avg. Lighting and rooms are average like motel 6. I probably wont stay here again. I would rather stay at aria.
40,We chose the park mgm this stay in Vegas due to location. (aerosmith at the park theater). It was a nice and clean hotel but to me it did not have that Vegas vibe many of the other hotels have. The room was clean. Service was fine. The location is the best part....if you are seeing a show at the Park Theater...or the Tmobile arena...this is a great place to stay. Also there is a free tram available to the Bellagio and Aria hotels and shopping areas.
30,The casino and restaurants are decent but the rooms are small and bare. With so many options on the strip stay somewhere nicer to get a better sleep and feel comfortable in the room. Walk through Eately for a quick bite.
30,"The room's (20-317) tub was significantly flaking and peeling and when I mentioned it to the concierge I was asked (rather indignantly) if I wanted to move to another room and when I said I think so was told ""come back later and we will see if we can find another room to move you to.""    The condition was confirmed by maintenance who took a picture to put in their files.    They have a very nice facility but these little touches make a difference when you are paying the kind of rates they expect."
20,Traveled to Park MGM for Valentine's Day and arrived on Wednesday 12 February 2020. The self service check-in kiosks were not operable leaving everybody to fend for themselves at the VIP Line. Played over $1000.00 on slot machines and never one a single jackpot. Casino should just be restaurants and no gaming.
30,This weekend stay was overall good. Only thing is that I called for toilet paper and 1 towel. Waiting for almost 2 hours in the room and no one showed up. I had to go down and request it. Other than that cheap minimum on tables you can play longer.
40,Service was great. Never ate at any of the Park places. Casino was ok. Bell desk was great and so was checking in and out. No lines. Rooms are ok. We just booked a king reg. room. It was really clean.
40,The worst part is typing this essay. The rest of my experience was good. The room was good. The place was clean and comfortable. I don't know what else to say. This 200 minimum character review requirement is annoying!
40,The Hotel is the old Monte Carlo Really dark on the 26th floor. The staff was exceptionally nice. I guess Smoking in the Casino area is allowed smelled really bad but what cigarette smells good? Room rate was fair drinks and food very expensive.
50,Never stayed at the Monte Carlo. Did see a show and the casino. Park MGM. Really nice. Bright and upgraded. The room is great. Very efficient. Plenty of space. The window seat is a great touch. All staff was super. Bell desk. Check in. Housekeeping.
30,No front desk service unless you are a VIP. Seems they are operating on a bare-bones payroll budget. Room looked remodeled but not modern looking at all. I thought 70's style hanging ceiling lights with the corded chain were extinct. Bed was comfortable but very low. Hallways are not well lit. Carpet in hallway bunching up a tripping hazard for sure. I expected more from an MGM name.
50,Very clean property people(staff) are helpful and friendly.The location was perfect for me.The food was good. I played in the casino and lost a lot of money but I enjoyed my stay at Park MGM. I recommend Park MGM.
50,Park MGM is the old Monte Carlo Hotel. Fresh and newly updated. The casino is smaller than some of the other hotels which is what we like. The room was ample and the bed was comfortable. Great housekeeping service. The best part of the Park MGM is the restaurants! We visited Bavette’s Best Friend Primrose and Eataly. All were top notch! Also their concierge services are great. And you can’t beat the location on the Strip.
10,The hotel service was just bad. The room lacked drinking cups  ( not even paper cups); no ice bucket. No soap in the bathroom . I complained to the cleaning staff and was ignored. I complained to the front desk as I was checking out and was told that I should have looked inside the clothes closet. Who in his/her right mind will think that drinking cups and ice bucket would be found in a clothes closet??? If that was the case then they should have a note or a card indicating so. In allmy experience was poor and quite unsatisfactory. I have stayed at the Bellagio as a Comp guest and I have always been treated with plenty of consideration and have been in beautiful suites. I will never ever stay at the Park again .
40,Had a great time at the Park MGM. Great location easy access to other hotels great casino and awesome restaurants attached. It was my first time in Vegas and definitely memorable. Made the whole weekend easy and great!
20,Booked our hotel and got a good deal on Black Friday. I decided I wanted to prepay. Called the hotel and was told I had to fill out an auth form and get charged $15 to run my credit card. I have never heard of getting charged to pay in advance. Most hotels are happy to have the money in advance. I ended up after talking to multiple people talking to the hotel manger. She was rude and basically said that’s the policy and if you don’t like talk to corporate. I sucked it up and prepaid. Come to find out they charge tax on that $15 so it’s actually $17 and change. The hotel puts a $100 hold for incidentals per day up to $400. We used another auth for the incidentals. They canceled that form without calling. I only found out when I called to check on it. I was told by the cashier office that I needed to call to make them aware. I said there is nothing on the form about that so how was I to know. He said he would process the form this one time then hung up on me. On top of that there is a $35 dollar a day resort fee. If you have an extra guest in your room $35. Want a fridge a fee. They do what the can to nickel and dime you.  On check in there is little to no help. I checked in after the rest of my party. Because the room was checked in I had to find staff for the room number. The room was nice. I had a strip view but could not see a lot. I had a better view of the roof. There is no desk and one chair. Showers only. The shower was nice but the shower head was disgusting and was not being cleaned. The closet was hard to find as it uses the same door as the shower. You can only have either the closet or the bathroom not both. The hallway had a very musty smell. The casino was nice but never a waitress around to get a drink.
30,It's a nice hotel. Personally I liked the Monte Carlo theme better over the minimalism rooms of the renovated Park MGM. Location is good and the Italian food court although pricy is very good. Don't waste your money on a strip view the Waldorf blocks the view at least to the north completely. But if the price was right I'd stay here again but the 44 dollar after tax resort fee is a total screw.
50,Great visit to the Park MGM. Stayed on MyVegas comp room while going to see Aerosmith. Very convenient location. Nice rooms. It was great to just walk downstairs to the concert when it was time. Aerosmith was awesome.
40,We recently stayed five nights in a King room at Park MGM. Everything about the actual hotel was awesome. We loved the self check in process!! The room was ready early and they sent me a notification on the app. We walked right in at 2:30 and there was no line for check in. It took maybe two minutes and then we were off to our room. Two different employees offered to help but we really didn’t need much help. We have stayed at four other resorts on the strip all with at least 30-45 minute waits to check in. The room was really clean and we loved having a couch. We lucked out with a room on the 21st floor so we kind of had a view. The best thing about the room was the water pressure in the shower. It was much more pressure than we even have at home.    The downer of Park MGM was its casino. It is probably the smokiest casino in Vegas. I don’t think they have air conditioning or heat its just like stale air where you can barely breathe. It’s not an exciting casino there is no vibe for some reason. The selection of restaurants is pretty limited but there are lots of places to eat around it. There is a free tram to Bellagio and a hallway connecting it to Aria which are both convenient. I would recommend the hotel for the rooms and location on the strip but not if you plan to gamble or eat there.
40,So this is the new place that wasn't here last time we came. It's layed out very cool. Easy to maneuver around. Great restaurants and bars. I like the fact that it is situated in the middle of everything.
30,Customer Service needs to be stressed to your individuals working at the MLife Desk. We dealt with 2 individuals there that had poor customer service which pretty much might break our decision to ever stay at this hotel again. Rude short poor customer service.
10,Was a mess and staff isn’t informed on the do’s and donts I won’t be returning or referring this hotel...really not much else to type check in was bad and I was asked to wait after speaking with several people on the phone that day advising me I would be fine all to check in and have to leave and go back and forth and put myself and my guest in an uncomfortable situation we were only there for the night and it was ruined when we did finally get checked in it was late and we just wanted to go to sleep all to just wake up the next morning and leave...the trip was a disaster from check in to bell hop service not being present for almost 15/20 minutes
50,Parking I was charged twice . $30 at check in and $30 at the Exit gate . How do I get my $30 back ? I’ve already called about it . Not good for business. Not cool not cool . Not cool not cool not cool .
10,Our rooms (we had booked 3) were filthy. I mean dust in everything and a thick layer. The drinking glasses had lipstick on them still. The bed sheets had NOT been changed. It was as though the previous guest left and someone went in and made the bad and left. So unfortunate to have this experience. The worst part not one apology from anyone.
30,Even though the room was free was disappointed there was NO coffee maker NO mini/fridge/microwave NO clock. One vinyl chair that had food crumbs in the cracks and STILL had the same food crumbs in the cracks after maid service. Wife & I both had backaches when waking up both days we were there. We were on the 22nd floor & I don't know how they clean the outside windows but they were filthy. We didn't notice it during the night time but during the daylight...VERY filthy. Like I said the room was free so I shouldn't complain too much.
40,Check in was good. It’s all done with the kiosk thing and it went better than I expected to. Rooms were updated and nice. My problem was the service in the casino. Nobody came around at all on the slots and it took almost an hour to get drinks while playing craps.
50,Very pleasant atmosphere. Staff is extremely helpful and the rooms are very clean. Good Italian food court. Water pressure in the large spacious shower was awesome.We will definitely be back. Location is great for those individuals seeking to visit neighboring casinos.
50,MGM is my favorite hotel chain in Vegas. But Park has always been my personal favorite. Even when it was Monte Carlo. Love the new Eataly experience! Great food atmosphere and fun staff too. Great items only from Italy too!
50,Great place for a business convention. Staff was awesome food was exceptional. The rooms were quiet and very clean. Hotel staff at check in was very accommodating. Great location and close to a lot of restaurants.
30,Nothing particularly great about the hotel. Rooms are basic...weird red color. Not sure what they were going for there. I’ve been to Encore/Wynn Mirage and Venetian. Park MGM isn’t even close to them in terms of room and bathroom. Restaurants were all good but Eataly was hard to navigate.
40,Our first time to stay here and went for the Aerosmith concert. We liked that the property is relatively small compared to others and it didn't take us too long to be able to navigate the hotel. Great location close to the sky bridge and pretty much everything you would need.  Not giving it a 5th star because of its little quirks. Although I realize they want you to eat out no coffee pot or even hot water. We paid the little bit extra for a strip view which we got and we liked but there is an ugly lower level roof top you also get to look at as well. The closet isn't really a closet and not good for actually hanging more than maybe 2 items. I never did figure out the shower head and our tub was peeling from a presumed poor resurfacing.  Checking in at the kiosk was easy and it was nice not having to wait in line. Staff was there to help.  The Aerosmith concert was amazing! If you are debating whether to see them you definitely need to. Venue was great no line to get a drink at the kiosk we picked no line for the bathrooms it was a great venue. A little normal crowding when the doors open but it wasn't bad at all for a concert and all of the staff there was friendly and helpful. P.S. and I definitely recommend eating across that street at the Hard Rock.
30,Best location if you're going to the Arena. There was a little issue with the check in process. I had 2 rooms on my reservation--I received an email only 1 room was ready. OK-not horrible but I never received an email that the second room was ready. I found out it was ready because I finally called to follow up on what was happening on the second room--they said it was ready--I never got the email notice. Had I not called to check I'd probably still be waiting to hear about the second room! Eataly the food place on property is disjointed and inefficient. Someone in the party went to get pizza and they had no coffee. She had to walk back to another area to get the coffee--they were out of coffee so she had to go to yet another place to get a cup of coffee. There is a lack of casual dining on your property. Starbucks is convenient to the room elevators but the lines are RIDICULOUS!! There was a leak in the shower so the floor flooded a bit. Didn't mention it while we were there--yes we should have. The bathroom/closet door set up is weird. It's set up like a sliding barn door...when the bathroom door is closed the closet is open; when the bathroom door is open the closet door is closed. So if you want to get into the bathroom and someone is getting their stuff in the closet you have to close the closet door before you can get into the bathroom. Weird. The rooms are fine-a good size clean nice decor I really liked the window couch that ran the length of the wall and the staff is pleasant. I was a bit disappointed with the check in process and casual dining options. By the way check in is all automated at a kiosk. They have people to help but you may have to wait for them if it's busy...we did.
40,The MGM Park is a place I would recommend anyone to stay at. The casino is the right size for me(small enough but big enough). There are good food choices to eat at and if there is not one of you liking just walk out one of the many doors and you are right there on the strip for other choices. The rooms are very clean and nice (a little small but you shouldn't be spending that much time in your room anyways..your in Vegas!!!) I will be spending more time at The MGM Park on my next trips there!!!
50,The hotel is very modern and love the decor. They made check in and check out fast and easy. Our room was facing the T-mobile arena and the black out curtain were on point. Definitely will be coming back
40,went on a combination of business and pleasure trip. overall a great value for the price we paid. great location on the strip close to all the major attractions. meeting space was very well equipped food service was good. good mid-range casino/hotel experience in Vegas.
50,It was a very short business trip and everything went as planned. The new kiosk check-in and check-out was a learning experience but there was a representative available to help. The food I experienced was fine but I didn't completely understand how the Eataly worked.
10,I checked in to my room went up stairs to the room and there was the previous guests trash everywhere used razors toothbrush nail clippings used towels in the bathroom used soaps still in the shower. So obviously the room wasn’t cleaned but the bed was made kind off. Don’t think they changed the sheets. Called front desk and they moved me to a new room with crappy view. New room was cleaned halfass but better than the room before but the ac didn’t work correctly.  Mini bar in room $16 for a bottle of water and $23 for a bag of candy COMPLETE RIP-OFF!!  Went to Etaly to get pizza ordered 2 slices ($22) and asked for it to be packaged Togo pizza came out but wasn’t packaged to go I politely asked if she could pack it to go she grabbed 2 containers and paper and said “here you can do it I’m busy” and walked off.  Oh did I mention cocaine residue still on the nightstand lol
30,Never stepped foot in this hotel while it was The Monte Carlo but after hearing of the renovation decided to try it. The casino itself was underwhelming but the rooms were nice aside from the thin walls (could hear some of the neighbors morning routines) but did not have any trouble sleeping. The big hit was Aerosmith's residency at the Park Theatre their show was amazing and even if you are not staying at Park MGM I recommend seeing them before their residency ends. As for food and drink fortunately New York New York is a quick walk away and the tram to Aria>Crystals>Bellagio allows for a quick change of scenery. Overall the stay at this hotel was affordable and mostly accommodating.
50,Great Location on the strip with tons of places to eat around that area. Mainly MGM resorts so you benefit from using your rewards card. Very comfortable beds and very nice remodel from when it was the Monte Carlo. Shops and restaurants have been removed from walk way to the Aria
50,Stayed their 3 nights 2 of those nights our room was not cleaned and front desk didn’t do anything about it but send up clean towels both nights. Overall the hotel is nice and perfect but housekeeping is really bad!!
40,My vacation at the park MGM was extremely exceptional. From the valet parking our car helping us with our luggage to the front desk getting a sitter upgraded room and giving us additional keys. The housekeeping was exceptional the room was cleaned on a daily basis the beds were made the room was pristine and the bathrooms are clean. Room service in room dining was excellent their service was handled very professionally and the wait was minimal. The casino and pool staff were also very professional. I have nothing negative to say about my stay at the park MGM my friends and family will definitely be staying again!
40,This hotel doesn’t take as long to exit and get to your room as other places on the strip. That alone would probably warrant me staying there again.    The rooms are still designed to get you out but the view was great from the 21st floor with the stadium right in front along with the New York roller coaster.    Everyone who worked there was very courteous and allowed us to check in an hour early. Room was very clean.
30,There was no dresser in room. No drawers anywher in the room. Food was expensive in all venues. Handicap room had a tub not a walk in shower. Staff was great though very courteous and helpful. Bed was very comfortable and the view from our room was great.
30,Hotel was OK. We booked a suite and it seemed a bit disjointed the way it was laid out. Lots of wasted space near the entry door. It used to be the Monte Carlo and it looks like they just gave it a fresh coat of paint. Room was clean and staff was outstanding. Food was INSANELY expensive. $8 for a slice of pizza $5 for a cup of coffee? Sit down Restaurants were even worse. $28 for 2 eggs bacon toast. We went to Denny's across the street. Casino was OK. Gaming tables seemed a bit outdated but again the staff was great. In general the hotel just seemed dated but the room prices are at a premium. Park Theater was awesome great layout great sound system. If I had to do it again I would chose a different hotel but definitely would come back to see a show at the theater
50,We had not stayed at the Formerly known Minte Carlo now known as Park MGM. I want to say 3 thumbs up to the new design of the property it looks great and refreshing to see a different style in Nevada. We got invited to the Big Game Party and had a blast met a lot of great people enjoy a great watch party. Thanks MGM
50,This is a good location on the strip (central). Inside Walkway access to the Aria. Beside the T-mobile arena. Nice dining options with eataly and other. Good mattress and renovated rooms. Service in the slot area is great.
40,Room was comfy had a nice view of the T-Mobile Arena. The toilet paper was a bit too thin for my liking so we bought our own. We also did mobile check in and had some problems with our bill. It refelcted an extra $111.00 for upgrades we didn't request. Thankfully Ace at the VIP desk was quick to help us and reassured us we wouldn't be billed the upgrade fee as it wasn't on our folio but was appearing on the app for some reason.
50,The rooms are gorgeous. Super clean. Very nice property. Take a look at my room photos.    Checking in online prior to arrival makes the check in process a snap! Every staff member I encountered was a delight. Eataly is incredible. Great pillows in a comfy bed. Maid service is spot-on. Excellent drink service at the video poker bars. 24 hour business center with free boarding pass printing. Giant flat screen TV with all the channels!    Across the street from NYNY and the T-Mobil Arena connected to Aria and the tram to Bellagio and a stone's throw from the airport the Park MGM location is perfect.    Thank you Jim Murran and your incredible MGM Resorts International staff for the wonderful transformation of the Monte Carlo into the spectacular Park MGM!
50,Love this hotel - so easy to check in doesn't take 30 min to get to your room pools are amazing and the food on property is incredible. Best Friends Asian/Mexican fusion is by far one the best places I have eaten.
20,The room was very comfortable as well as a great bed. The odor of cigarette smoke was overpowering in the room on the 28th floor as well as through out the entire resort. Eataly was awesome and well worth going to.
50,This place was fantastic. Right next to the T Mobile Arena. Everything you need is within walking distance. I recommend buying alcohol at Walgreens or CVS Pharmacy which are a-hop-and-skip away from the hotel grounds. You will save a ton of money with this simple advice.
30,I stayed at this property because it was where the Aerosmith concert was taking place. While it was certainly clean and the bed was very comfortable for the price the room was rather basic.I have been to Vegas multiple times and have stayed and much nicer properties for less.My room was overlooking the roof and again I expected more for the price Fortunately the concert was great and the room didn't matter so much.I will stay at another property next time I am in Vegas.
50,Park MGM is the best hotel that I have stayed at in Vegas & we have been there 15 times for every wedding anniversary staying at a variety of places. It is small cozy & very easy to access all the amenities including being right on the strip. Check in on the iPads was simple & flawless. We stayed in a stay well room which was well worth the extra money.
40,The location is great in the middle of everything on the strip. It’s near shops and restaurants. The rooms are spacious and very clean decorated in a modern mid century style. We also enjoyed Eataly with lots of options for food and drinks.
20,Expect to pay double or triple what you paid through a third party when all is said and done.    Also if your room is dirty make sure to have them switch your room.    Parking is $12-$15 every time you go in and out.
10,Very expensive could have stayed at nicer hotel with more items for the price. Hotel was terrible traffic was bad had long walk distance e from parking to hotel escalator was broken room did not have microwave
20,See previous reply. Check in reservations gift shop ( no prices visible ) no coffee maker rude front staff. Additionally we were woken up several times during the night due to loud guests ( walls are very thin). I stay in Vegas twice a year we booked this hotel due to a concert.
40,I always stay here. Excellent service and location. The restaurants may be a little below some of the other places near by so only 4 stars. Not that big of an issue though. The service and staff makes up for it and I will be back!
40,The rooms are clean and well lit. The bed is comfortable. We are in a plain room so no coffee maker mini fridge or microwave. Most rooms I have been in while in Las Vegas have no coffee makers. It does have a nice size shower and bathroom area. Housekeeping has been doing an excellent job of cleaning. Room key cards must be used in elevators to access your floor which is nice. I have noticed regularly security around the resort and even on the room floors which is nice. There is easy access to the strip.
30,The Hotel and room was nice but the casino has is very smoky due to poor air filtration I walk across the street to NY NY to gamble we gamble for about 2 hours and saw the cocktail waitress once. The Eatily restaurant area is very nice but pricy and small food portions.
50,Great location on the strip. I love their check-in/check-out process no need to wait in line for 30+ minutes. Room was clean and did not smell bad in anyways. I would definitely continue to stay their in the future.
20,The casino is entirely to smoky. They either need to replace the carpet or install a better ventilation system. The casino is non pleasing to non-smokers. Also they need to have live check-in counters as well as self check-in systems.
50,Stayed Park MGM during superbowl weekend 1st time since switch from Monte Carlo (and montey was a favorite) rooms very nice had a nightingale suite lots room comfortable beds very clean and quiet room / casino very nice lots of newer themed slots / great drink service while playing from Jessica and Dawn would highly recommend returning in July
50,We travel to Vegas annually and have stayed at most resorts/casinos on the strip. Since the remodel three years ago the Park MGM is one of my favorites! The staff is friendly and kind the casino is bright and clean the pool area is nice and the eating options are fantastic with Eataly in the front of the building. I really appreciate the location of ParkMGM because it is more centrally located on the strip with tram access to Bellagio. The amenities are great and I look forward to my next stay!
20,"Room decor is fairly barren of any tasteful design or appointments bed was poor sagging mattress uncomfortable. Ridiculous prices - $16 for a bottle of water in the room? Who are they kidding? $14 for a small below average margarita in the casino bar? Cold bland tasteless pizza in the restaurant in ""Eataly"". I would not stay here again."
20,We were supposed to stay 4 nights but checked out after one. Beds are rock hard and I was up all night listening to loud music coming from somewhere until 3am. Wasn't impressed with lay out of restaurants.
50,Helpful staff at check in suite was beautiful and clean with nice view of the strip room service was a bit lacking in choices Eataly is a must go everyone you asked for help was very nice. Will stay again
50,This was our second trip to Park MGM our first was cut short (were there less than 24 hours) due to an emergency at home. The hotel itself is very nice. Our room was great. We were staying 5 days 4 of which were a comped suite from our MLife rewards. I highly recommend the Park MGM.
50,Best hidden secret in Vegas. Tram access to bellagio and aria so easy to move down the strip. Food was great I highly recommend this location for anyone that comes to Vegas. We saw Aerosmith at park mgm and that was worth every penny. Steven Tyler doesn’t age
50,Location. Efficiency. Quality. We were very impressed with the property. Golden Knights Hockey right next door brings the thunder and crowds. Aerosmith in the house too!! Can’t beat that atmosphere. Job well done Park MGM!
30,I checked in on Friday morning and got a king handicap room because I wanted early check-in and that’s all that was available. That was fine although the room was older and not updated like some of their other rooms are. When I woke up Saturday morning I noticed a little red dead bug crawling across the sheet right next to my face. I grabbed my phone and took a video and a couple of pictures of the bug and then captured it in a glass and took it down to the front desk. They moved me to another room but didn’t seem very concerned about my belongings and the fact that they could’ve possibly gotten into my bag they did however some of my fees but since the room was an M life card anyway there really wasn’t much for them to come up. I just feel that they should’ve been more concerned about the fact that my belongings could’ve been affected and giving me some kind of direction as to how to handle it when I got home.
50,We love staying at the Park MGM. The restaurants are great the location is ideal for us and the rooms are really nice. The walk to other MGM properties is super easy and the gym has everything we need.
50,I have always had good experience with Park MGM. I like the convenience of self check-in and check-out. Once help is needed employee is very willing to offer to their best.  The only inconevience is the sound from Arena when game is on  I cannot fall into sleep easily. Overall the hotel is good for stay and spending time with Family.
40,Felt safe and staff very polite. Room clean and beds comfortable. But the room lacked simple things like a refrigerator so you can have cold water in your room. I guess the prices for a bottle of water is more than some drinks.
30,We stayed at the Park MGM October 26-29 2019. The self service check in did not work well for us so initial reaction was one of frustration. The hotel is nice great location and our room was decent enough. Nothing too fancy but enough. Despite our windows being filthy we had a good view of the area around us and enjoyed the view in the evenings with all the lights. The casino is good not too crowded or out dated. We used the tram between the Park MGM and Bellagio which was free and easy to use. We had friends staying at the Bellagio so it was super convenient. There is plenty of food choices within walking distance and the Eataly was fun to wander through. We particularly enjoyed the festivities when the Golden Knights had a game at the T-Mobile arena during our stay. Super energetic with lots of activities outside the arena and just steps from the doors of the Park MGM. To eat inside the hotel is quite costly in our opinion so we stuck to more moderately priced restaurants outside the resort. Staff at the hotel were excellent and did a great job accommodating our needs at the casino and managing the rowdy weekend crowds that are inevitable. We would recommend this hotel and give it a solid 3.5 out of 5 rating.
40,The hotel is well appointed. Spent a lot of time at Eataly as it provides a good amount of options for food. Crack Shack is very good as well. Bed was comfortable and the view of the strip was nice from the 26th floor.
40,We flew in last minute for a concert at T Mobile Areana. You can't beat the Park MGM for its location. It was literally an easy 2 minute walk if that out the front door of the hotel to the main entrance of the arena. This hotel used to be the Monte Carlo. Rooms were clean and quiet. The rooms were a bit small and the decor was nothing special. The location was great-right on the strip with access to lots of restaurants the Aria tram and the strip. There's even a Starbucks inside the hotel although it gets very busy. We were there on a Saturday night and were pleasantly surprised to find tables with low $15 minimum bets. We usually stay at the Wynn or Palazzo and at night the minimums are usually $25.
50,Room was great. I've stayed several times since the remodel and enjoy staying each time. we stayed in a double room partial strip view on the 6th floor. room was clean and spacious. We brought our pet dog since he had a surgery and needed monitoring. i had never realized before but they had a pet area for them to relieve themselves which goes a long way in the minds of pet owners considering bringing them along. it was our first time bringing the dog and all the staff was especially friendly when it came to him very reassuring. at one point my room key stopped working and when i went to the desk to have them fix it the FD agent remembered speaking to us about the dog and asked about his well being. Staff here really cares about their guests and it shows there is a reason i continue to come back over and over. We also attended the Aerosmith concert which was absolutely incredible. for anyone on the fence about it there isn't a bad seat at the park theater and the show blew my expectations away. Now for the not so good parts. I did play a lot this trip and i play exclusively at MGM properties in vegas because of the rewards program. I gamble with them have the credit card and use the MyVegas rewards in combination when i visit to stack my comps up and it really makes the trip. This time i was told that you cannot use Free play rewards when the room is comped which is unfortunate because i always stay on a comped room so it means i will never get to use free play rewards through the app. You used to be able to so i don't like that they took that option away. its less for the player. at most you can use $75 of FP through the app each month so it does seem really cheap of them to take that away. i always used it to offset (in my head at least) paying a $40 a night unreasonable resort fee. I also played a little at NYNY It was my first time playing doubke deck blackjack there at $25 min a hand a played for about 90 minutes. i lost out and was waiting for another member of my party to be finished so i just asked out of curiosusity how much i was down. the pit boss then informed me that he did not have a card for me in the system meaning all that play was not recorded. i had moved their from another table in the same pit. i asked how could that be. (usually moving from one table to another in the same section they will not need the card again) when i sat at this table i checked chips (brought chips from the other table) and the dealer called it out to the pit boss. that is a cue for him to ask me for my card if i wasn't already in. so i didn't worry about it. the dealer could have also asked but it is not her job to. i worked in player development for 4 years so i know how things work. this is how i always stay free how i know to use everything the casino is willing to give comp wise. so when i asked how he couldn't have me in the system he tried to tell me that it was because i never gave him my card. i informed him i moved from another table. he then tried to say that the table i came from wast in his section so he couldn't have known i had a card. He was very rude in trying to tell me that its my fault for not knowing these things when i told him that i know its his fault due to my history in PD he got even more rude and spoke down to me. His name was David and he was a pit boss at NYNY between 2AM and 3AM the morning on Feb 7th. Luckily for him Another pit boss named Jonathan came over hearing the discussion and told me that he would set back my time and fix it for me at witch point David walked away. i checked on the mobile app and confirmed with a casino host that he did correct the mistake. aside from that the trip was excellent. Side note Manda was the dealer at the table that night and even though she took all my money (lol) she was extremely professional and kind to all the players while i was there including myself. i was making sure to put higher than usual tip bets for her as she deserves it. that being said its all the more reason for me to go back to the park MGM rather than NYNY. and why i still gave a 5 star rating.
10,Terrible from the minute we checked in. Checked us into a dirty room took almost an hour to get keys to the new room. No accessible ice machines anywhere the maid barged in the room at 9am the next morning and did not knock. When telling the front desk about everything and the concierge desk no one did anything to compensate our experience. Took someone at the New York New York hotel to provide the customer service we should've received at Park MGM. I have emailed guest services about the experience and no one has responded back.
50,Stayed here to watch the Aerosmith concert @ the Park Theatre (which was amazing). Eataly was a bonus to have right inside the hotel with great food / drinks ! Rooms were great and staff was very helpful! Will stay there again for sure.
40,This was an interesting stay the hotel is lovely the location is good the Concierge is poor. Not at all professional went there three times had three different people all children who knew nothing. I felt like I was at a high school asking for help.
30,We arrived on Tuesday morning. Check-in was a breeze and the room was ready early. We dropped our bags and ran to our first mtg. We came back to the room around 9:30pm and noticed the room was not clean. I will refrain from writing what we found next to the bed but it was bad. The previous person’s stuff was also still in the closet. We moved rooms and found food on the floor nightstand and the bathroom had its own issues. We called again. We did get one night of the resort fee removed and a food/ beverage comp (equals one drink for two). The next night came back and the food and bathroom issues still remained. The girl we spoke to at the desk could have cared less. It was finally cleaned the next night... our last night. Very disappointed and won’t stay here again. I will say we had great service and food at Eataly and Nomad bar.
50,Stayed here for a business trip. Our convention was off site so I didn't get the full experience of the Hotel but the experience I did have was all positive. Would definitely stay here again on a personal trip in order to take in the full experience this hotel offers.
50,Traveled here on business. I’ve been making this trip for 5 years and generally stay at MGM so I was looking forward to staying at the newly renovated hotel.    Favorite Things:    1: Showers!!! I love a hot shower with great water pressure. The shower here is the single best in terms of temperature and pressure of any hotel I’ve ever booked.    2: Cleanliness- no weird stains no dusty build up. Clean beds floors and bathroom which is the single most important thing to me when traveling.    3: Service- I decided at the last minute to extend my stay. The lobby staff were eager to help me.    4: Check in- Check in was quick and painless. You check yourself in and print your keys at a kiosk. There are enough kiosks that you aren’t waiting forever. And there are staff available to help you if you can’t figure it out. Really simple though.    5: location- on the strip proximity to all the best restaurants and shopping.    Not so favorite:    1: Eataly- food selection is greatly limited there’s chicken Italian over priced Korean fusion. But close to other hotels with better restaurants which is a plus.    2: casino is small. I like table games not a lot of tables here.    3: No Dr. Pepper. I live on that stuff. And life water cost more than Voss!?!    Honestly I’m reaching for negatives. I really enjoyed my stay.
10,House keeping went through my belongings as well as stole cash out of my room. Reported to management and it wasn’t taken seriously. Maybe it’s something you might want to consider before staying here
50,Came with coworkers on a business trip to a convention going on at the MGM Grand. So glad I got to stay at the Park MGM was an amazing experience and definitely will return. Loved all the stores and eatery’s. Amazing shows. And great atmosphere.
50,Our annual Vegas trip was great. Park MGM has a great and friendly staff. The hotel is conveniently located to several other resorts like the Aria and MGM Grand. Room was clean and comfortable but who really stays in the hotel room for an extended period of time while in Vegas. Enough table games and slots but the sportsbook is pretty small. Park MGM had been great the past 2 years. Hasn't disappointed and will definitely be in contention for next year's Superbowl trip.
10,Several cleanliness issue inside room reported to front desk issue not resolved. I would not recommend this hotel for future stay for any other business events. Would like to receive a call for my inconvenience
40,Location is great....centrally located friendly staff and clean resort. For just being 'remodeled' the rooms did not seem that updated. The hallways and rooms have low ceilings and the hallways to the rooms were really dark and kind of dingy. The beds were really low to the ground too which seemed odd. Rooms were also kind of dark. I stayed there years ago when it was still the Monte Carlo and I remember the rooms being nicer than that. Overall it was clean and I felt safe but not sure it's worth the $170/night....then again everything in Vegas is expensive.
40,The rooms are very clean comfortable bed nicely updated. But i don't smoke and don't appreciate having to inhale someone else's smoke all night long. I couldn't sleep well only because of the smell of cigarette smoke so strong. This is not good for non smokers i think we should get a discount for not being a smoker. We have to pay the same price but inhale cigarette smoke the entire time.
20,We were booked for 2 nights to attend a concert in the theater. The room was noisy 4th floor room 234. Housekeeping storage area directly above and the racket all day was ridiculous. If you’re looking to relax and take a nap mid afternoon to rest up for going out at night forget it. So we decided to go sit by the pool but they closed the pool at 2pm on a sunny afternoon 52 degrees in the shade but felt like 70 in the sun. Said it is hotel policy to send lifeguards home when the temperature dips below a certain point. It was warm and gorgeous! Guest services were rude. Only plus was Dustin a hotel employee who asked us about our stay upon checkout. He waived the $83 ‘resort fee’ as compensation for our overall less than pleasant stay. I won’t be going back.
40,The Park MGM was hotel that I had never stayed at before even when it was the Monte Carlo but I am glad that I did try a new venue on this trip. The Park MGM was a very clean hotel with a very friendly staff! Great value for the $!
50,Great place to stay. Join the players rewards club ( M-Life ). Lots of great perks.  The room are clean and the staff is great.  You need your room key to operate the elevator.  easy chech-in and out.  1234
50,After a long travel day I was pleased with the customer service and problem solving skills of Ashley Fleming at the front desk. She ensured a had a great room with a great view of the strip. She was courteous and professional during our interaction.
50,Most of the time I visited Vegas  I like to stay in Park MGM . After remodeling everything look so clean and the rooms are very nice . The staffs are very friendly. Always make you feel relax and comfortable.
30,We stayed at PARK MGM for my husband's 50th birthday over Superbowl weekend. The room was basic at best. My room had no drawers only a small closet. We lived out of suitcases the whole time I hate doing that. Our bathroom had a bathtub our friends rooms all had nice glass walk in showers. If you are getting the room at a really great rate or comped I would stay if not there are much better hotels in Vegas!
10,Really tight casino a lot of older machines. No excitement feeling in the casino. All the restaurants are really overpriced. I am kinda getting tired of getting hit in the wallet on every corner out there. I paid $8 for a glass of ice tea. Almost every meal for 2 was right about $90. It would only be worth it if it was an amazing place but it's just not.
40,Place is very close in Las Vegas strip. very clean good house keeping staff. desk clerk are so easy to approach and very helpful. Lobby area is not really interesting compare in the other hotel.close to T-mobile Area
50,We were in town for Super Bowl weekend. We also attended an Aerosmith concert at the Park Theatre so this was the perfect place to stay. The hotel wasn't too big and that made it easy to get around and meet up with our group. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The Eataly has some real good food highly recommended.
20,Basic customer service. No drink runners on floor. No food court(one big Italian theme restaurant area). Passed out person outside my room for hours. Disrespectful guest services. I asked to speak to a manager and none were available(they were in meetings). I asked for a call back and still has been 2 days. I do not typically leave reviews I travel several times a year and my wife is a respected travel agent. I would not recommend this hotel for the cost.    1 hr 45 min total sun on pool
50,Great casino! Very nice rooms. Excellent restaurants with great service. Very clean. If you want a small hotel with all the amenities this is the place to stay. Very convenient to the strip and concert venues.
20,Midnight. On a Wednesday Night. I can’t believe the sound in our room. Not sure why it is so loud. Sounds like a band right outside our window. No way to sleep. Casino is very underwhelming. Smokiest casino of the MGM properties. Been in Vegas 50 plus times. First and last trip to the Park!
50,I had a great stay at park as I do with most mlife places the whole staff in every department was so friendly and helpful and to make it better I even won a little cash on the single deck table (please don’t get rid of that one)
40,Pillows in the room was very uncomfortable. I woke up with my neck hurting and so did my girlfriend. We slept without pillows all night long and the pain went away. Overall the room was nice and clean. They attempted to clean out room once barging in without permission when we had the DO NOT DISTURB on
40,Pro's- Room was gorgeous and big TV was awesome and new and huge view was amazing bathroom was modern shower was great-temperature and look room decor was chic and modern and the artwork was fantastic!    Con's- Safe was locked and never fixed it- when called down they said it would take a 1/2 to fix and didn't want to wait. For the price comparable hotels will offer robes and/or slippers. No coffeemaker no fridge no microwave- All services available at comparably priced hotels.    Overall fantastic room and would stay again.
30,Dining was not as high level as one would have expected. Wish rooms had a tub in them. Would have like to have seen a buffet like all the other hotels offer. Also the hallways to the room could have been better lit and more seating in the lobby
30,I’m very disappointed with the room renovations partition wall makes the room to small. TV mounted on the side wall of bed not practical for viewing while in bed. No mini fridge or coffee maker has changed my mind of ever staying again.
30,Just an average hotel. quality of sheets towels are poor. casino staff is edgy. Not the nicest group. We played video poker for 3 hours and was told only one comp and well vodka only. We explained that we spent over 400 in the video poker machine and was told we had to pay for our drinks regardless.
50,I liked Monte Carlo I LOVE Park MGM. there are so many new and interesting dining options a speak easy and the dining crown jewel Eatily!  As far as the rooms go I've seen a couple different styles but the I find the dark green with the inset King beds to be my favorite very relaxing. The Red painted rooms not relaxing (for me) but quite striking so I'm sure there are lots of people who like those.  I have not had the opportunity to use the pool since it became Park MGM but still looks nice and I noticed an additional rooftop pool area that I've not seen before.  As far as proximity if your going to the T-Mobile center for any reason this is the BEST location so convenient. But it also has a monorail that goes down to City Center/Aria and Bellagio (really cuts down the walk to center strip).
50,"Stayed here well over 50 times as Monte Carlo and then recently Park MGM and NoMad.  Best location on the Strip. Tram to Aria and Bellagio. Easy walk across to NYNY and then across the bridge to Luxor and Mandalay Bay.  They just built a new bridge over Las Vegas Blvd to get across to shopping and MGM Grand.  All rooms are newly updated as a matter of fact the entire property is new.  We got an upgrade to a wellness suite and it was nice.  Don't touch anything in the mini bar unless you want to pay $$$$. And I mean ""just touch"". You will be charged for it. It's OK if you do not mind paying $18 for a bag of chips and $8 for a can of pop.  I love this property though and usually have been staying at NoMad (the top 4 floors of Park MGM) but we stayed at Park MGM this time.  Really good place!"
50,We didn’t win bunches but we received frequent bonuses and had a good time playing. The room we’re very nice. The staff was friendly and helpful. The food was good and not too pricey. The staff was friendly and helpful.
10,"This was a miserable experience from the start. To check-in you go to a kiosk - not a person which we did. We reserved a king ""stay well"" room. We then got our keys and lugged our luggage to our room (no one was there to help). The room reeked of smoke (clearly a smoking room) and had two queens. We immediately turned around and went to the kiosk to find help. We found a person and informed him what had happened. No apologies. He just checked his ipad and said that the room we requested was not available. He said all he could do is downgrade us if we wanted a non-smoking King room. We said that was not acceptable and he shrugged his shoulders and said words to the effect of ""too bad"". I assure you I was unbelievably pleasant. I asked if we could cancel and he said I had to go to the M Life desk. I asked where that was and he pointed at the casino. It was actually all the way across the casino so we marched on lugging our luggage. When we got to the M Life desk the rep was appalled. He also said that it was completely unnecessary for me to walk and that the attendant could have just called. He then took care of us cancelling the Park and reserving a room for us at Bellagio. Going to Bellagio was like night and day with a pleasant attendant and offer of assistance and a room that was actually what we reserved. Suffice it to say the Park MGM was awful and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. It is definitely not a 4 Star Hotel."
50,My stay at Park MGM was great! The food and bar options are really upscale and the casino is clean. They also play great music selections which makes gambling whether winning or losing a fun experience. I said this before but you MUST eat a Bavette's it's amazing!
20,View looked over the top of another building. Bed gave us a backache. Maid walked in on us naked twice. No frig or microwave or coffee maker. Our room cards and minibar were deactivated hours before we were to check out.
50,Wonderful place to stay. Close to everything. Very clean and updated. Excellent staff from every department. Felt very welcomed. Oh and very secure and safe. Restaurants had a variety of foods and drinks for everyone
20,This Is as bare bones of a room and you can get at this level of establishment. Not a single drawer a wall-mounted wardrobe with four hangers. My husband and I are staying here for four days of business. I cannot unpack my bags or hang anything. That single shelf or drawer in the bathroom for toiletries.    Resort fee $37/day plus $15/day parking. And no drawer. I’m here at minimum two times a year and typically stay at the signature towers. Thought I would try something new. First and last time for me.
50,Room was very clean. Nice bathroom and shower. Everything in this hotel is automated. Nice casino and restaurants. Good location. Room Service was accommodating and concierge staff was helpful and friendly.
40,Room was very nice clean roomy and comfortable. Great eatery area (Eataly). In and out access 24 hours Parking is $15 for hotel guests. Very secured guest elevator- must use room key to gain access. Convenience location.
50,I'm an MGM Resorts Mlife member so when I'm in Vegas I always try to stay at a property to build points and comps. The Park MGM is one of my top choices thanks to its central location more affordable price point and excellent convenience (for comparison my other regular choices are the Vdara and The Mirage). The Park MGM works best if you want to be close to the City Center complex but have a cheaper option than the Aria or Vdara. The hotel is nicely appointed with understated room designs but what's provided works well. I especially like the long couch right in front of the window which is perfect for stretching out and enjoying the view. The best views (in my opinion) are facing City Center; you may not see much of The Strip but the glittering modernist buildings pool view and Aria Tram all more than make up for it. It's actually one of my favorite Vegas views. I've stayed a number of times and my room has always been quiet (less noise than when facing The Strip and also less noise of airplanes/helicopters than I've noticed at the Vdara). Beds are generally comfortable though I've had a stay where my bed felt a bit stiffer than the other times and was a bit of a miss. I personally prefer the beds at the Vdara but these aren't bad by any means. The regular rooms are big enough for 2-3 adults and are good for couples or a small family; don't expect anything massive but there's enough room for you your stuff and a bit of space to stretch out (this is one advantage of having less furniture). The hotel's layout is similar to the other tri-wing Vegas hotels (a hub with three spokes) which means that it never takes long to walk to your room (even if you have the last room on the spoke which I've had several times). Elevators are fast and very convenient; I never have had to wait long here.    Convenience is definitely king for the Park MGM. When you arrive you can park in the self-parking lot (definitely cheaper and more convenient than the Vdara where it's valet-only) and walk straight across to the hotel. Take the escalator down and you're right at check-in in less than 3 minutes. From the lobby it's a 30-second walk to the elevator and a minute later you're at your floor and then at your room. No need to walk through the casino floor or big crowds to get in or out; it's fast and easy. If you aren't in Vegas to gamble you don't even need to walk by the casino floor here. However if you want to play it's as easy to get to the floor as it is to get to the lobby or rooms.    The only significant inconvenience with the hotel is the check-in process. Everything is done on kiosks which often have issues and require personal attention. That said I've never had to wait in a check-in line here. And if you don't want to deal with the kiosk you can just go up to the desk and be checked-in in minutes. It's the one downside (and was a big detriment the first time I stayed here) but I've gotten adjusted to it and really you can always ask for help from the staff (who are always around) or just go to the desk.    The casino provides a good assortment of slots though less emphasis on table games may be a downside for some. It's not a prestige gambling center but has more emphasis on casual gaming and entertainment. I've found a good selection of slots here and generally do just fine gambling-wise. Personally I haven't had any big wins but I'm also not a big gambler and am in it more for the fun than the fortune so it's easy to play for a while and enjoy. Pretty much all the standard and popular slots are present and there are enough low-denomination machines for casual players (again entertainment is the focus more than hardcore gaming). For members the Mlife desk has average waits (compared with other MGM casinos) and can handle requests quickly (my top Mlife desk is at the Aria but the Park MGM has always been just fine).    Sticking with the entertainment theme one of the best reasons to stay here is if you're seeing a show at the Park MGM Theater. I saw Lady Gaga's Jazz & Piano show here last year and it's no exaggeration to say it's the best concert I've ever been to. The theater has a great rotating roster of talent and concerts so for anyone in town for that this is the logical basecamp to stay. There's also the potential to string shows together and see a late night performance after the main event (for example Brian Newman's After Dark jazz show) which is a lot more convenient if you're staying here. With regard to restaurants I've only eaten at Primrose for breakfast but highly recommend it for excellent chocolate pancakes.    Finally bringing it back to the convenience factor if you stay here you can get a lot of other places without a car and without much trouble. Want to go to Aria and the rest of City Center? Just walk through the covered hotel connector or hop on the Aria tram; it's way faster than driving (you can be there in less than 15 minutes or less than 5 if you catch the tram just as it's leaving). Want to go to New York-New York? It's literally just out the door and across the driveway (walking time from your room in the Park MGM to the casino in New York-New York: under 10 minutes). It's maybe not as convenient as the Vdara for being right in the center of The Strip action (from there you can walk and be in either the Aria or Bellagio in 5 minutes) but it's a very close second. Staying here I never feel like I'm restricted or have to take any effort to get where I need to and for going to Aria/City Center I don't even have to go outside if it's hot. And the parking is incredibly fast and convenient for when you want to get out and go exploring. This is a great place to stay if convenience and a central location are important to your trip; it's a great hotel often at a good price and I highly recommend it based on multiple stays.
30,I went here for work and fun. Was at Park MGM for 3 nights. Lovely room--can't complain at all here. Great bed shower everything good. Slots are super tight. You can't win here. Go elsewhere. We took the tram to Bellagio and did much better. Food is expensive although Italian sit-down restaurant was fabulous. Very impersonal.
20,it was a great room rate until you look deeper. No mini fridge 16.00 for a bottle of water in the room and resort fees on top of it all. The rooms were clean comfy beds but very minimal for Vegas Strip.
20,no front desk no one to answer questions no good resturants or shopping this is vegas with out hospitality. this is vrbo on the strip. we had several issues during our stay but there was no front desk so who do you talk to just dont know. then the rabbit club off of the casino and not one person in it at 9 on a friday night of superbowl weekend. went to check out and were charged twice for valet but no desk and not enough time to figure it out before we left to the airport.
40,We had a fabulous time would highly recommend the hotel although the strip view meant we heard the noise from the strip even though we were on a higher floor. Easy access to other hotels in the chain.
40,Our stay at Park MGM was good the hotel is well located and the room was clean with a comfortable bed. You can get to Aria through a closed walkway or directly to the strip walking through the casino.
20,No amenities in the room no alarm clock no free water no coffee maker no fridge no instructions to work tv. No restaurant to have breakfast in! Things are so far spaced apart. it Was Super Bowl weekend and a George Strait concert and escalators for skyway did not work! WTF
20,I would skip the Park MGM... The only things that are even worth mentioning about this hotel are the gym and the shower pressure in the bathroom. The walls are very thin and we could hear the people staying in the room next to us very clearly. There were no coffee pot or mini refrigerator in the room and there is a charge to use the in-room safe.
50,Everything was great from the restaurants to the casinos room service  every was just perfect like I said this is my go to in Las Vegas. Thank you sooo much park MGM!!!!!! I would definitely recommend this to anyone oh and etaly!!! Amazing!!!!! Nice steaks huge prawns!!!
30,This hotel is nicely decorated and the room and shower were very nice. However even though the room was on the 20th floor the bass from the nightclub music kept us awake . Also we selected the strip view room. Technically you could see the strip but the view was really ugly and all roof top air conditioning and parking garage.
50,We have business in Las Vegas every January and so we have stayed in many of the hotels. We found the Park MGM to be one of the best! It was clean well staffed and comfortable! We liked the location too! Thanks!
50,We had a great visit to the Park MGM. The hotel is in a great location easy to get accross Vegas from here or walk along the strip. T-mobile is right across the quiet street.. The food and vibe within the casino was over the top. We will be back to stay again for sure.
10,I had to constantly repeat myself. Negative environment where no one won hardly. Shower leaked and the room was hot. Not to mention the casino floor was hot. I will not stay or gamble there again. That casino just takes your money most likely to pay for the poor renovation.
50,Everything that we experienced was great. Loved the entry to the hotel. My room was clean but it would have been better to have more space to lay our things out. There was no surface space in the bathroom.
10,Large amounts of paint were on outside of window no mattress protector on mattress too many corners cut on room furnishings (all towels were stacked on top of sink as there is no room for towel storage!).    Picking up keys was a joke and housekeeping disregarded our Do Not Disturb sign 2 minutes before 11am.
50,Front start to finish staff friendly and extremely helpful! Breakfast in primrose was fast excellent and the bar staff very friendly answered all our questions and helpful planning our day. So close to t mobile
50,Staywell room was worth the little bit extra. Hotel staff was nice and helpful. Everyone staff member I met greeted me. Ate at Layla Noodle and it was fantastic food. Will definitely eat there again..
30,We had 2 rooms and both were extremely hot all night and couldn't be cooled down regardless of temperature setting. Food options are very limited(and closed in the afternoon) so we had to go elsewhere which was fine. Smaller resort so it was easy to get around. Check in/out was very easy.
30,I had stayed here as the old Monte Carlo and found the property very worn. Since renovations its jumped up a notch. Check in and check out were entirely electronically. You receive a welcome email when your flight is arriving go to a kiosk scan your ID and your key pops out and away you go to your room. The bathroom situation is much improved it felt clean and new. If I had a complaint about the bathroom it was the sink which was this white modern looking but seemingly plastic one piece sink/counter which already had stains in the bottom. The rest of the room was generically adequate. It was tight on the wall side of the bed. It was also a narrow path from the entry. The king bed now backs up to the bath wall and even though the bed faced the window the room still seemed dark. Lighting in the room didn't help the dark feeling much there is an overhead lamp in the seating area which just felt harsh in terms of the lighting effect. There is also no closet in the room anymore just a very shallow wardrobe so if you like to take your clothes and hang them or put things in drawers you will find this room lacking. I'm not sure what the theme of the decor exactly is supposed to be. There are a lot of little generic photos on the walls in groups and the furniture items don't seem to related to one another. Perhaps it was meant to represent an eclectic collected look but it just felt disjointed. A note on the casino if you are looking for a free drink while playing slots you are likely going to be disappointed altogether or wait forever. After playing (and losing) on the same machine for 20 minutes I gave up and moved on. The Eataly concept is an interesting one but I found most all of the presentations grossly overpriced but hey its Vegas and food's not cheap anymore. If I had to choose among the MGM properties on the south end of the strip as a guest I'd still probably choose this one over the other choices since its the newest renovated. While the MGM itself is nice as a guest you'll walk yourself to death for everything because its just too large so food the pool your room are all a long haul walk. At least the Park MGM is designed like a 3 spoked wheel so your walk to the room isn't as long.
50,After a mix-up at check-in which was handled rapidly the rest of the visit was wonderful. Friendly staff GREAT food comfy beds. Recommend Primrose for Breakfast and take a brief walk outside for a visit to Crack Shack...yummmm
10,Not Satisfied drinks  room and stuff .  90% of Waitresses are very Rude and unprofessional  nor qualified alcoholic drinks .room was dirty and we called and complained . Casino is taker only no return .
10,Overall disappointed. Expensive for what you get dated rooms and ridiculous minibar policies. I do not stay in Vegas often but i cannot imagine other MGM properties with lowest value than this one. I travel frequently and i am ok with the basics. This property does not meet that
50,This was our 2nd stay at Park MGM.Very impressed on how easy it was to check in and out.The TRAM helped save time and many steps.The great entertainment at Park Theater is the best in. Las Vegas Great variety of slots.
30,Hotel is nice and rooms were clean beds were too soft. But checking in was a chore. You will be asked quite a few questions that you need to type out on a touch screen. I would prefer if these questions were asked prior to going on my trip or if they provided a key board. It is especially bad if you have more than one room to check in as you have to go through this process each time for each room. Thank goodness it was not busy when I checked in so a staff member could help me check in my other room while I did my first one.
50,Good Vibe enjoyed my stay food gambling. Coming back in May to see Lady GaGa can't wait. The Eataly eatery was very popular and busy. A lot of food options in there to choose from. The new Las Vegas Boulevard crossover is very convenient.
40,Check in and out went with ease but it is all automated. Room was clean and on the smaller size for Vegas. They put the dresser in the closet to make the room bigger but now you have no room to hang clothes. The door for the closet is the same for the bathroom so if you happen to be in the closet and some opens the bathroom door watch out as it hurts getting hit in the head the door is solid. There is no fridge in the room and the safe is in the closet. The beds were great. Water pressure from the show is very good.
40,It is a hotel with a very good location in the middle of the strip in front of the T-Mobil Arena and within walking distance of different city icons such as City Center and the New York New York and Bellagio hotel. Comfortable rooms but austere in finishes and amenities. But the price-benefit ratio is very adequate. Good food options good casino atmosphere. I found the SPA treatments extremely expensive but the cost of daily facilities is reasonable.
50,Always stay at Mlife properties..thought we'd try Park since it's new. We had a lovely clean quiet room with a great bathroom. All the staff we encountered were very friendly & helpful. Food options are fantastic. The casino staff makes gaming enjoyable. Location is optimal & never waited more than 1min for an elevator (even with conventions going on). Would definitely stay here again!
20,the soundproofing was not adequate there was not space to put up toiletries in the bathroom not enough space in the closet no microwave or fridge no luggage rack. Nice mattress and bedding and good light blocking blinds
50,Room was comfy clean and cozy. Blackout drapes work so well we slept wonderfully. Everyone very friendly. If you see a concert here there really isn't a bad seat. Aerosmith was awesome. Primrose great food
40,The side of the bed closest to the night table was definitely softer than the other. I would have preferred to have a cooler room at night but the control wouldn't go past 18.5 C. But overall this was a fine hotel. Just make sure your taxi/uber driver knows you are going to the Park MGM ours took us to MGM Grand and we had to walk. Not a major issue.n I would definitely stay here again for the value. Not sure I enjoy the electronic check in.
40,We stayed here for the 1st time had a few issues with check in but they were easily resolved. Overall decent place to stay and an easy walk up and down the strip to nearby casinos and hotels. Lady Gaga mini museum was pretty cool.
30,Maybe they're not done with renovations but my room was only adequate. I was staying for business so adequate is ok - but even so most of the other rooms I've been in have been better (not including the Monte Carlo this hotel's former incarnation). I've heard the rooms are all different - half our group said they were ok the other half were not happy. The decor is meant to be eclectic but is just ramshackle. The lights are dim. The main light has an old fashioned cord running over the ceiling to a switch at the other side of the room. Ok. But then there were the lumps in the carpet the industrial shelf for your towels in the bathroom instead of a cupboard or vanity stuck shower head that couldn't be moved to be tall enough a low hard bed and the loud noise from the club downstairs. Check-in was messed up so it told me my room wasn't ready even when it was. Room service food was tasteless and overpriced (ok it's Vegas). Everything was clean so if you need a place to stay this is fine. It's just that there are so many better options at the same price point why stay here? The only reason I'd come back is that the hotel restaurant options were awesome. Rooms not so much.
40,Went for a trip to Las Vegas to celebrate my husbands birthday. This hotel is accessible and great walk to the strip. Food wasn’t too exciting inside the hotel so we needed to cross the bridge and eat. Loved that there’s a team connecting the hotel to Aria and Bellagio.
50,The check in process was very fast and easy. The staff were kind and courteous. We loved the Eataly and their wine selections. The rooms were clean and comfortable. We really loved the area they have set aside for Uber and Lyft made it very convenient.
20,This was marketed as a “boutique hotel”. I beg to differ. I found the rooms to be teeny tiny and not very clean. The carpets seemed dirty and not new. This size hotel room is the same size as rooms in New York City.
30,"I understand that that resort fees are now the norm in Las Vegas but I do not accept this. I particularly think it's a rip off during non-peak times of year. I visited the Park MGM in January when many of the facilities are closed or only running on a limited basis. The Resort Fee is $37 + $5 tax. So for $42 extra a night my advertised rate of $89 a night is already $140+ a night before taxes. This is advertised but the list of amenities is slim for what you get for $42 per night. Wifi and a half open pool was all I could tell that I was ""getting"" for this fee. I used the WiFi but I was there for business and not for lounging at the pool so the pool went unused. I did not gamble in the Casino but this isn't something they should charge a fee for either. If this trend of resort fees continues as it seems to be moving that way in many cities it should just be added to the room charge and not be an over and above cost to travelers. I also think that if this trend continues then the fee should fluctuate during the season. In January make it lower. Or let the customer opt out of this fee. Give a wristband or key fob to customers who want to use the pool and for those who do not give them the choice.  As for the property itself the rooms were comfortable and have been recently refurbished in a tasteful way. The building itself is older so the rooms don't have the magnificent floor to ceiling windows of some of the newer properties nearby.  I did like the convenient check in kiosks. They were easy to use and seemed to get rid of the problem of long check in lines that many Vegas hotels have.  The property itself has several interesting restaurant choices including Eataly Nomad and Best Friend by Roi Choi all of which are great choices and varying price points. There are also a number of choices just outside the property which are good options too.  The rooms are clean the beds are comfortable. I did have an issue with the fact that they don't give you water glasses anywhere in the room. They would prefer that you buy the overpriced plastic water bottles from the minibar but why not even offer glasses. It didn't make any sense to me.  It is a new enough property that I may return and could have a different experience but I vehemently disagree with the high resort fee being added to my bill."
50,Park MGM is absolutely beautiful! Check in/out was so easy staff were all wonderful Eataly was absolutely phenomenal....what an adventurous experience. We plan on returning back soon...hopefully with comped rooms!
50,We stayed at the Park MGM because we attended Calibash at the T-mobile arena. It was the perfect location. We walked there and avoided Ubers. The room was really spacious clean and modern. I would stay here again.
50,The transformation of the Monte Carlo into Park MGM is nothing short of spectacular!    Our room was immaculate the decor gorgeous the red tiled bathroom shower fantastic! No waiting to check in with dozens of tablet stands for electronic check in a modern sleek technological solution to standing in line for half an hour or more waiting for a front desk agent as I'm sure many of you have endured. Giant flat screen TV window couch/settee comfy bed and pillows; slide the bathroom door closed to reveal an alcove with dresser iron ironing board and ice bucket. We enjoyed the experience so much we've booked three more stays in February March and April!
40,"We greatly enjoyed our stay at the Park MGM although it is not quite 5*.    Rooms - clean with an efficient set up. We really enjoyed the couch bench at the window as ours had great pool views. Maybe a little small but the bathroom was very nice and spacious.    Pool - even in January the pool and hot tub were open and us cold weather Midwesterners greatly enjoyed the usage on the sunny 70 degree days. Nice area and still busy in the winter.    Casino - Clean although definitely smaller than most in Vegas. We loved the slot variety and daily $5 blackjack which was a break from the rest of the strip. Drink service sometimes lacked even during slow times. Wished there was more live entertainment in the casino not just weekend nights    Dining - we never ate on site due to lack of choices. Nothing 24/7 and nothing ""casual"" aside from the Crack Shack and Eately. Wish there were more options and open all night. Starbucks was always busy.    Service - Nothing special nothing ""above and beyond."" Employees werent rude or unwelcoming but didnt extend any olive branches for things such as room location requests or late check out.    Overall not bad and would come back with more comped rooms"
50,Guys golf trip with the second consecutive stay at the Park MGM . Convenient location for our group. Easy walk or tram access to other Strip hotels and events. Fun eating and shopping at the EATALY experience.
10,Too smokey. Do not understand the concept of reservation. Only 20% of the population smokes but this hotel allows the 20% to ruin an experience for the remaining 80%. Had a reservation for a King. Only queens available when we checked in. The hotel obviously does not know what reservations mean.
30,The hotel has been redone with exception to the rooms. I did not like having to check myself inn. The gentlemen working the drive up was kinda rude and we had to ask him to help us. The fact that Eataly is in the hotel is a plus. We had a great meal there and that is an amazing store.
50,We like the Park MGM because it's not too big but it has a lot to offer. Great location. The new Eataly Italian Experience has great food. The Park area is nice too...they offer free live music. It's a nice environment for couples or family.
50,Clean good location. Food a little expensive but it is on the strip. The Italian Eatery was cool. I was in town for a furniture show and the newly remodeled rooms were great. The staff was very helpful and the self serve check in saved a ton of time.
40,I have now stayed here a couple of years in a row for opening NFL weekend. The location is great very close to the strip without having to walk too far to get out of the hotel. Lots of restaurants and other stuff close by and the T-Mobile arena is right across the street. The rooms are fairly basic but newly redone modern and had what I need.It had a decent gym but I did go to the spa and it was not worth it at all.  I enjoyed the pool area fairly nice if boring but lots of room and good service. Also a nice selection of tap beer as well. the security at the pool is a little over zealous on what your bringing in at times though.  Great value when I have been here !
40,Many changes in the last year each time we come it is improving. New bars new places to eat. Eataly was open last year but it still is packed. The resort is old but looks new we visit every year to Vegas and ParkMGM is a favorite
10,The room was dated no coffee maker Mini fridge and the walls are paper thin. Definitely would not stay here again. The casino is so so as well as the service. You would think a nice resort in Las Vegas could include parking but not here.
50,Nice location on the strip. Easy access to many other casinos and the new overhead crosswalk is fantastic? Slots are still a little tight though. We had previous commitments for dining at other locations so did not try the restaurants this time.
10,The room had one chair in it and not one drawer. The light bulb had some weird yellowish tint not pleasant. No towels left in the room on the second day. Room service at 7:00am -1 1/2 hour wait. Everything comes in an unappealing paper products. Cold coffee in a paper cup is $8.00 and they forgot the sweetener. Housekeeping never cleaned the old coffee cups out of the room. Pretty bad experience.
50,I finally found my hotel for biz staying!  Clean and calm not traffic in the aisles and 0 noise in the room. This is totally what I was looking for! Not the crowdy messy lobbies and a clean spot! Totally in love
20,Not a classy place to stay. All of our rooms were dirty upon check in and they don’t Even provide water glasses or cups for the rooms. Way overpriced for a less than mediocre establishment. Will not be staying here again.
50,The Monte Carlo went through a major overhaul and is now the Park MGM. The rooms are nice with good amenities. My room didn't have a bathtub (shower only) which I found disappointing. The price point is good for its location on the strip.The property has 3 pools and many different eateries including Eataly and La La Noodle as well as nightlife On the Record. As with all MGM properties there is a resort fee and a separate charge for parking. Recommended!
40,I have no complaint. Stay was very good. I will definitely  recommend to friends. Food is excellent.  The only thing I like to see that be nice if there are some décor  for the Chinese New Year that why I was there.
30,The room is small and you can hear the noise coming from next door. There is no dresser for your clothes and the bathroom was very small. The location is great since its next to other hotels and T Mobile arena.
40,I would have given you folks a 10 however we prefer to play 2-deck blackjack with a $25 denomination. Unfortunately the Park MGM only has $100 2-deck tables in your high limit room. Therefore we elected to play elsewhere where almost every other casino we visited featured $25 2-deck tables.  Sorry we would have loved to play at your house but we were forced to go elsewhere.    The room was very nice however and the employees were very accommodating. Thank you!
30,The reataurants and ambience was nice but the service was not good. You are only allowed to access the floor on which you stay. You blocked from going to any other floors with the exception of the gym and spa. Also the checkout took me 25 minutes because the attandant was new and alone. I almost missed my flight.
50,Park MGM has a great location to shops other properties trams and open space. I enjoy the location and the new Park area with benches and chairs to enjoy the sunshine and open air. The new nearby overhead crosswalk is a great addition to the area.
50,Really very pleased with our recent stay. The rooms were well updated and clean. The restaurant selection was very good. The kiosk check-in that some complained about in other reviews was actually very convenient and way faster than standing in a long check in line. Table games $10-15 to start. We had breakfast two mornings at Primrose. Have the garibaldi cocktail!
30,Rooms are very small and still seem quite tired. They re-used some dated accent furniture and the beds have seen better days. The halls are dark with outdated lighting.    The bathroom redo is pretty good but several items were broken (wall hooks tp holder) and were not fixed despite being reported the first day.    There are virtually no family eating establishments in the hotel just bars and fine dining. There is “Eataly” - a kind of crowded overpriced Italian food court at the front of the hotel - if you like very expensive Italian food and line ups.    There is a pretty good selection of games in the casino but waitresses were hard to find and often took drink orders and never came back.    It's nice that it's is attached to the Aria and the tram down to the Bellagio was convenient.    Overall it was ok - won't hurry back.
20,Stay at Park MGM was not what I was expecting. The rooms are very small compare to other hotels and for the price we paid. Housekeeping was called for several items and we never received. Bell desk not available!
50,The Park MGM is an amazing place to stay while in Vegas!! It is located on the strip and there is so much to do! We attended a concert at the T-Mobile Arena and it was less than a 5 minute walk! So convenient!! We love staying at the Park MGM!
20,There's nothing special about this hotel. It is so big that to go anywhere you have to walk a long ways through the hotel and the smoky casino. The rooms are just ok. No fridge. The amenities were not all that accessible due to hours and/or cost so the resort fee was pretty ridiculous. Check in and check out via self checkout was not pleasant.
50,I recently stayed here with some friends and had the best experience. We were recommended to go to Eataly by Security Officer Fernandez and she also told us about how popular The Record night club was. Both were a hit with my friends and I and we all had a great stay. We never left the casino because it had everything we needed. Thank you!
20,This was our second stay at the Park MGM after feeling we may have been too harsh on it the first time around.    Nope it really is that bad.    Compared to other strip properties Park MGM feels cheap and lacks amenities. Check-in is done on kiosk with no human interaction for assistance with picking a room or clearing up reservation errors. Our room did come with features like a toilet clogged on arrival makeup smeared on the wall a shower that dribbled all night and a great view of the bright pink neon screen on the T-Mobile Arena that flashes 24 hours a day. Be ready for an intimate experience with whoever you're traveling with as the bathroom door doesn't lock and has a gap on the bottom.    The best things about Park MGM:  -Bavette's Steakhouse is an under-appreciated restaurant worth making a reservation.  -Location is mid-strip making it easy to get around.  -I really can't think of anything else.    The worst things:  -Poor-quality sleep from thin walls and cheaply-designed rooms.  -Even the clean towels have a gross odor.  -The entry smelled like raw sewage? This was a theme we encountered at the Bellagio and Mandalay Bay as well.  -Most restaurants and bars weren't open during the day or into the late evening.  -Casino was always dead. This place feels like a funeral home.    Better rooms for the price at the Luxor. Better gambling at The Cromwell. Better energy at The Cosmopolitan. Better food at Caesar's. We've learned our lesson and won't be back.
50,I really enjoyed my stay at the Park MGM my room was very nice and comfortable. It has a very contemperary home feeling. The bed was very comfortable and the shower was one of the best I've ever had in a hotel. I will definitely stay there again.
50,We really liked the hotel the check out and check in process was very good no waiting! We were able to check in early with no issues or waiting and we had lots of places to choose from to eat if we did not want to leave the hotel! Eataly was awesome and the really added to the hotels overall experience!
50,Excellent Hotel / Casino to stay at in Las Vegas for very reasonable price. Central to many of the places and shops we like to go to. Italian restaurant (Manza??) was excellent. Excellent food and service.
50,Overall the Hotel was clean. Great service from the staff members. Our suite had great strip view. The location is perfect there are many good restaurants nearby. Great experience at Park MGM Las Vegas.
50,Came there for softball tournament with daughter room was not ready and never recieved text But wheb I came back they took care of me quickly and politely. Ate at steakhouse but sometimes had to eat on the go but dinning options had too long of lines. Sometimes have to eat on the fly.
50,Loved that the only smoking was in the casino area. Love that the hotel is non smoking in general. The only complaint was that 4 people were in our room and they only supply 2 washcloths but 4 towels and 2 hand towels. And no coffee pot in the room.
50,We chose this hotel for its close proximity to T-Mobile Arena for a show that we added to our trip. We were able to park & stay close by with only a short walk. Our room was very nice! And check in was good!
50,Great location. Beds are very comfortable. Easy access to the Tram. Helpful mlife desk.  We would highly recommend. If you are going to an event at T mobile this is the perfect place to stay. This was our second stay and we will return.
50,Great food...Eatly is a must if you love Italy and Italian cuisine and Manzo is amazing for a sit down meal with good food and wine! Wonderful venue for shows loved Tiffany Haddish and looking forward to coming back to see Cher!
50,Our room very modern look and clean I just do not understand with extra charge mini bar to remove it ($50) its kind too high with so many restaurants and bars that offer good deals I won't even want to munch mini bar inside my room.
40,Great hotel with a nice location. Nomad is kind of confusing as it's within the Park. Walls seem thin as many in our group complained of noises nearby. Our room had routine and regular noises that can only be described as a machine twisting springs. Thought it was the elevator but that was no where near us. Weird. Overall it was a great property with good strip access food options nearby and parking close by.
40,Not the most vibrant place to stay in Vegas but it’s clean and it’s a convenient location- Minimal interaction with staff most were friendly. Not much to do compared to the other MGM affiliates. Hallways on the floor were not well lit.
50,Awesome experience. Can’t wait until next year to come back to the soccer tournament. Your staff was awesome and took care of all our needs. We really appreciate at it. Although we lost in the quarter finals of the tournament you all were great
10,We stayed this weekend and it was our first visit to Park MGM. I had high hopes after what was portrayed online but the actual property fell far short when we arrived.  Already pretty old and run down feeling and the staff was not overly nice. For the $ and the other choices in Vegas I would not recommend this hotel.
40,The hotel was very nice with many restaurants to choose from. It was nice to be able to utilize the tram service at no additional cost. The staff was friendly and helpful if you had any questions. The location was great.
50,Great hotel and service! Close to T Mobile Arena and in the heart of the strip. We were here for the McGregor fight and couldn’t have picked a better place to stay! We took the Craps lesson which was free and quite informative. Drinks were a little pricey but we walked across the street to the ABC store for most of our alcohol.
30,Park MGM sits in the middle of the strip and is a decent hotel with good value for the money. While some cheaper dining options no longer exist in the hotel cheaper options are within walking distance. Being close to CVS is a plus.
50,The stay was very enjoyable. The place is very clean and classy. Not to much of the Smokey Smell like in other hotels in Vegas. Great location on the strip and the bed is very comfortable. We highly recommend especially for the price!
40,This was my first time staying here since there big remodel I like the fact it is in the heart of everything. Cheap food is no where to be found so we always went over to New York New York to eat at the food row. Hot tub was nice to use and easy to find. One thing that was odd they were still cleaning rooms at 10:30pm so it was noisy next to us for awhile.
50,This was not our first time at Park. This trip was a complicated event with a medical event. But the Park was truly a great place to escape to between our challenging dealings with health facilities.  This Hotel is truly a class act. Perfect location amazing amenities to the point that you really don't have to leave the premises to enjoy a great getaway time. Thanks Park MGM
50,Hotel is located right next to T-Mobile arena and the restaurants are amazing. I would recommend this hotel to everyone. The blackjack tables are fun and have a good energy around them. Our room was clean and ready as soon as we checked In
50,We love staying at Park MGM. Great location food and rooms. Probably will keep staying here. Definitely want to see a show here my wife really wants to see Lady Gaga. Can not wait until we come back.
30,I'll be upfront we only paid for one of our 3 nights by using a discount with an app associated with MGM Hotels. That being said I can't speak towards the value directly since our costs were way lower. If we did have to pay for all 3 nights at their King room rates we would have stayed elsewhere. The parking is convenient to the check in area which made things there smooth. The area was packed with a line to use the check in kiosks. I'm old school I'd much rather speak with a person than a computer to check in to a hotel. There was a gentleman directing the flow of people in line to the kiosks as they came available. I asked him about merging rooms (we had to reserve our comp nights separately and were told over the phone to just merge them at check in) he told me I'd just call the front desk from my room after check in and directed me to a kiosk as I was walking away I heard no one was getting a room (they weren't clean yet although it was after check in). I used the kiosk as directed and was notified that our room wasn't ready I asked an employee who was in the area where I could get an eta on the readiness of the room so we could determine what to do while we waited she directed me to the VIP check in guess this was the only place to speak to a person. I waited and was promptly polietly and professionally assisted by the desk agent she made some calls and quickly got us actually checked into a ready room and provided us our keys. I asked her if she would be able to merge the reservations instead of me calling from the room she looked shocked and asked me who directed me to call from the room I guess that isn't the proper way to do it. She apologized arranged the merge and let me know I could return to this desk in the morning to make sure my keys were properly setup for the next two nights.  Our room was beautiful. I truly enjoyed the dark greens and florals throughout the room. The artwork was fun and not the same old thing you see in every hotel across the country.The layout was very comfortable with a couch nicely appointed directly in front of the window. Our view was of the hockey statium with the mountains in the distance. We aren't crazy about a strip view so this was great for us as we'd watch the sunset over the mountains. The functionality of all the electronics were nice (plugs USB ports adjustable TV) and in great locations everywhere. The bathroom was spacious and the shower stall was nice there was a great shelf to put our toiletries outside of the shower during our stay. Only downside is there wasn't much space to put things off the floor of the shower. We spend our time in Vegas outdoors hiking climbing and getting dirty so we really don't want the things that are supposed to get us clean on the floor with the dirty water. I loved the adjustable mounted mirror in the bathroom to help with beauty routines the comfortable couch and seats and there was more than enough room to spreadout even just for the two of us. The drapes and window coverings were amazing!!! No light got through those suckers! The closet had plenty of room and a tall narrow dresser with drawers for those looking to unpack. The full sized wall mirror was also a plus when getting ready. The downside for us first off would be the costs if we had paid for everything. Another downside is the room lacks a fridge and coffeemaker we travel cheap (hence using the comp nights) so we bring food and instant coffee it's hard to do that when there's nowhere to keep your food cool or anywhere to make hot water in the room. I understand they want to encourage you to use their restaurants and shops but black coffee isn't worth the costs typically. The parking situation was kind of a mess we were constantly confused as to whether or not we had properly setup our parking on our room without being double charged when we arrived we got a ticket but then added it to the room then the room key wasn't working and twice we had to have the attendant contact the proper parties to get the gate to open for us it was just annoying. Also paying $15 a day for parking is quite ridiculous. I understand if you aren't staying at the hotel but on top of the price it adds up quickly.  Location is great. Things were very clean. Probably only going back if it's comped again.
50,MGM Park is fabulous. Rooms are spacious and clean. Easy self check in and out. Eataly is unreal I know it from Boston. Italian everytrhing who could want more. Coffeebar is Eataly was awesome. Attendenant very attentive and friendly. A great location near Aria Cosmo etc..
50,This Hotel is located perfectly for exploring the strip. The free tram from PARK MGM to Bellagio saves your feet and puts you mid way up the strip for accessing all other hotels.  The Eataly has a fantastic selection for breakfast lunch and dinner.  Great casino easy parking. Best location to stay if you plan on catching an event at the T-Mobil stadium.
20,Hotel staff is absolutely great but the rooms are not up to par. Even a 'suite' has one of these foldable beds the aircon in the room next door made it sound like I was sleeping in a ship's engine room and they forgot to clean my room twice ...    Next time in Vegas different hotel for sure.
30,If you're hoping for good sound sleep bring ear plugs! Mattresses are overly soft and may just need replacing. Staff is incredibly friendly and rooms are outfitted nicely just not comfortable for sleeping which was my main purpose of the hotel room.
50,This was the first time my family and I stayed at the Park MGM (used to be The Monte Carlo) and they did a wonderful job with renovations. The moment we walked in the staff greeted us and ask for Derek he is the best man ever. He gave us great recommendations on places to eat for breakfast and he provided exceptional service all weekend. If you stay here you must ask for Derek he will take care of you! The hotel was amazing and I'll definitely be back!
50,Incredible facility classic and comfy rooms with charming decor. Wonderful very helpful and friendly staff. Great location.  Loved the quiet pool and convenient layout. Best place to stay on the strip!
50,My husband and went to Las Vegas in May of 2019 our first trip in over 20 years. We stayed at the Bellagio and was in awe of the beauty and and magnificent display of the hotel itself. After finding our way to our hotel room some of the staff were anything but friendly. We booked the Penthouse suite and were a little disappointed. The room seemed dated but the bedroom and bathrooms were wonderful. What did not make our stay so lovely was the looks and inquiries of the elevator attendant who thought we were riff raff and did not belong. Not every women wears high heels and dresses to the nine. Regardless I did not appreciate it. However we stopped at the Park MGM to look around and ended up at the Concierge desk with some questions. Gary was on duty and what a wonderful delightful young man he was. So much so that when we went back in October we stayed at the Park solely because of our experience with Gary. Never looked at a room pool anything. Gary was so exceptional I have reached out to him for some ideas for our 25TH wedding anniversary as we’re spending at the Park MGM. Patty was also a ray of sunshine helpful friendly and they both were very welcoming. They are exceptional at their job and deserves to be commended. C & M Haymon
40,First time staying here and was plesantly surprised. Not a huge fan of the room decor but the property was clean and well appointed. Loved the option in the morning of the 'coffee cart' for those of us non-Starbucks fans. The cab lines were quick and the locaiton convenient...within walking distance of several good spots. Eataly was an excellent choice for dinner one night and we didn't even need to go outside. Well done MGM!
40,The Park MGM renovation was very nicely done. Stayed here a few months back. Clean hotel and you can tell everything is new. Room was good but on the small size. Not much of a strip view so im not sure id pay extra for one. Great location next to New York New York and The Park. Eataly is a must for any meal and is at the core of the hotel. Nice pool area where we rented a cabana for the day and loved it. Tram that runs to Aria and Bellagio was very convenient. Will stay again in the future.
40,Good location has tram goes to aria and ballagio room is clean convenient walk to other hotels CVS store right outside easy access to get drinking water and bring back to hotel. Shopping eats are all nearby there's a hau of Gaga at the hotel and the exhibit is free.
40,The room I was in was nice but a friend of mines room did not look as good as ours. I would stay here again but I will also pay a little more to stay somewhere else too with no problem. It’s not that the hotel was bad it’s just I’m sure we can get more perks and better living if we pay a little more.
40,We paid the extra $10-$15 a night to get a room with a strip view. Though we could see the City Center hotels we could not see Vegas Blvd. That's not what I had in mind when paying the up charge. The window shades were electric and controlled by a switch on the wall which made it nice. The room was clean and well maintained no issues at all.  The casino had a good selection of slots including Willy Wonka Flintstones and Lampoons Vacation that we enjoyed playing. Also any time night or day there were plenty of $10 blackjack tables available. My only issue with this place was that you had to walk through Eataly(the food court) in order to walk through the front door. There's no open foyer or anything you just have to zig zaq through tables chairs and the crowds of people to even get through there. I feel like there should be another entrance ON Las Vegas Blvd that does not require you to walk through their food court.
40,This is in a good location and was clean. I've stayed at several Vegas strip hotels and this was just ok...definitely not my favorite due to a few minor issues The sink in the bathroom would not drain the pillows on the bed were all stuffed super fat so sleeping was not comfortable at all for either of us the room would not cool down... Also I didn't feel like there weren't many inexpensive foot options here. We usually stay somewhere with a (fast food) court as we like to split something cheap for brunch the do a nice dinner. Starbucks was ALWAYS packed. My husband was in town for a soccer tournament and we were up super early everyday. Eataly doesn't open until 7 am for breakfast.
50,We've stayed at Monte Carlo and now the Park MGM many times. It is our go to place in Vegas. We have stayed at most of the MGM properties and some others but you can't beat the Park MGM for location and its smaller size.
40,Great hotel very good service and kind people great location close to M&M Coca Cola TMobile Arena Walgreen's the casino had a live band on Friday night it was awesome i would recommend had a great experience
40,We went back to the room around mid night we found out the sheet has stain on the bed side we asked to change the sheet. They came in 25 mins and changed them. Then the new sheets have a stain on the top covering sheet we had to accept it after the first change.
30,My two sons and I were attending the UFC fights. The Hotel was a great location for us but we were not very impressed with our stay. My sons wanted me to teach them craps but all the tables were high priced not conducive for new players. The clubs would not allow us in as of 1am on a Friday or Sat night. The clubs were closed or all tables reserved
50,Excellent housekeeping. Great location. The tram adds a lot of convenience making it easy to travel from T- Mobile Arena Park Theater Park MGM Grand Aria and Bellagio. Tram is free and fun especially if you are with friends! Also it's easy to get inside and around the Park MGM hotel (other Vegas hotels are massive and require tons of walking - Park MGM is the perfect size). Had a great experience. Hotel rooms are a little outdated. My bathroom was new but the wall paper and lamp shades could be freshened up.
20,The hotel rooms are not that great- the bed was no comfortable and I asked for a king and got two queens. The self check in confusing. Also to have self check in and then VIP check in is pretty pretentious for a hotel that is not a luxurious than other hotels on strip.
40,The rooms were nice the shower was flooded due to a slow drain as was the sink. The parking was a mess since there was a UFC fight one night and a concert the other night Overall we had a good stay. the Crack Shack was a good friendly dinner place and Eatly was refreshing
20,Room too small and too dark. We came cause you sent us a free room to try for 2 days. Was only able to book 1 day and front desk did not extend the offer. Ended up staying at Vdara hotel for the second day.
50,My wife and I enjoyed our stay. We had every question answered by friendly staff that were eager to help. We will definitely be staying at this resort again! Very clean from the lobby to the rooms and the Casino floor. Food was excellent and drinks were delicious.
20,"There are a ton of good hotel options in Las Vegas but Park MGM isn't one of them. Essentially they just changed the name of the hotel from the Monte Carlo and did very little to renovate it but raised the price dramatically after changing the brand.    I stayed there for 4 nights over MLK weekend with my wife and two kids while my son was in a hockey tournament at several rinks in Vegas. Most of the team was staying at the New York next door which is a dump so we decided to stay nearby at the Park MGM.    The best part of this hotel is the location which is right next to the T-Mobile Center and near a bunch of good places to eat. There is also a very good high end Italian-oriented food court (""Eataly"") in the hotel.    Beyond that there was not much to celebrate. We stayed in an upgraded ('stay well') room and there was nothing about it that seemed upgraded. The beds were just uncomfortable and none of us got any sleep over the 4 days. The air conditioning unit was very loud and worked intermittently and when it did work it only worked on one side of the room. There was not much water pressure. The room was pretty small compared to what you get at most Vegas hotels for a double queen.    Outside of the room the common areas were not all that great either. The gym was small with old equipment not all of which was working. The pool and hot tub were both small and had very short hours of operation (they both closed at 4p). The casino was 2nd or third tier and there was no poker room or sportsbook (there is a sports bar where you can place bets but it is not any place you would want to watch a game).    The check-in area promises a quick check-in if you get their mobile app but the system didn't work for us and required human intervention for nearly everyone around us (which they were not staffed for)."
40,We had a good time with friends at the hotel. We enjoyed Eately for dining. Would prefer to have an in room coffee maker for added convenience. Rooms were clean and staff was helpful with any and all questions. Easy in and out from self parking.
40,Nice place to stay. There are some exceptions. Checking in made me feel like a robot. Miss human contact when checking in. Rooms are ok. Housekeeping was great. We are late sleepers. Some employees are rude. Restrooms are to far apart.
50,The remodel of Monte Carlo into Park MGM is spot on. From the remodeled rooms to the ornate ceilings on the casino floor to the beautiful lobby to the multitude of clubs and restaurants this hotel is way more fun and elegant than it used to be. Will be back soon!
50,We came to see a show at T mobile and it was literally across the street. Room was nice and beds were comfortable. There was no coffee maker is the room so we had to go to the Starbucks downstairs where the line was long and all of the drinks and food were over-priced. $4.58 for a drip coffee!!
30,A bottle of water is 16 bucks in the room. Obviously we didn't use anything in the room. A cheeseburger was 15 salad 19 our first night at the burger deli. Pizza 8 bucks a slice at Eatily. Anyway we ventured outward to find better pricing.
20,The room was nice but the bed was poor. Did not like the mattress- very uncomfortable- Food choices were good and lyft access was excellent. Close to airport i liked better when it was the Monte Carlo
50,Great place! There was a great staff. I forgot my jacket at the hotel and 1 day later they were already shipping it back to me. I feel very pleased with the service overall. I am very glad I stayed at the hotel
40,So when you think Vegas you think nights out and gambling... We had great nights out but the gambling in Vegas has really gotten to where it sucks... You used to at least be able to play for awhile on the machines with $1000 but not the days... Lucky if you can even hit single bars these days... I don’t mind loosing but at least let me play awhile...  The hotel itself is very nice and nice to stay in...
50,Quick vacation with friends good location great food rooms were clean and very spacious. Good value. Be sure to ask about free trams to sister hotels Mandalay Bay and Bellagio you can save a LOT on cab fare up and down the Strip
20,I really wanted to like the Park MGM but I was told three different things by staff about my stay's benefits and none turned out to be right. Then it took four tries to get the bill right which did not honor any of what I was told by the desk staff but did eventually honor what I had been told at booking. There really is no excuse for such a mess and when it got straightened out there was nothing said or done for the extra trouble and no attempt to honor the mistaken information I was given by staff.
50,I enjoy staying at this hotel! Plenty to eat and short distance to the other hotels at the strip. Staff is helpful and friendly as well as the ease of checking in/out. I can't wait to come back in 2021 :)
50,Park MGM has excellent customer service professional and kid staff! Thank you!! I will stay with you in the future!!! I have to admit that this was a great deal and I am impressed!! Keep up the good work!!
50,Another great trip to Las Vegas. The Park MGM is a beautiful hotel. Very colorful theme. The machines stand out and there was a nice middle bar to hang out at. Loved the place. Yes I would stay there again.
10,Tried to check out and system billed me incorrectly me for overpriced food and beverage items in room. It took 20 minutes to flag down the ONE check our representative and when I tried to ask the lazy front desk staff for help who were just standing around the pointed me to a VIP line full of people. Very arrogant and rude.
50,I very much enjoyed my stay. I had no problems at all thank you for everything you guys did to make my birthday weekend a memorable weekend. it was easy to park and get into the hotel with the parking garage so close.
30,In Las Vegas for a convention. The Park MGM benefits from a very convenient location on the strip. The hotel staff at check-in were very helpful. The rooms were not at all impressive. Relatively small in size a bit dated and no work desk (just a table and leather like chair which was not suitable for work). Eataly the Italian marketplace is attached to the hotel and there is also a Starbucks just off the lobby. The Primrose restaurant overall was fine but strangely it took more than ten minutes to get seated at a nearly empty restaurant. There are better values to be had in Vegas.
40,Park MGM was the perfect location guest rooms were roomy and comfortable. Food choices were numerous Staff was friendly good variety of gaming tables and slot machines. Room value was in a decent range. I would definitely stay at Park MGM again.
40,3rd time in Vegas always try new hotels rooms were comfortable  had pool view location is great only done fall no fridge in the rooms self check was easy. Loved the Eataly part of the hotel all the restaurants were amazingreal good quality food this was the reason I choose this hotel and I definitely will stay here again.
50,Golf trip with the boys everything went smooth from checkin to checkout stored our clubs with the Bellman so we didn't have to lug them to the 25th floor. They them ready for us in minutes. Breakfast at the Primerose was excellent and dinner at Bevettes was outstanding. Roast Beef sandwich at Eataly was so good.  I like the location across from T-Mobile.
10,The rooms are small dirty and smelly with way overpriced snacks and no amenities to speak of. The casino is Smokey and old feeling. The staff are mostly rude and arrogant. Avoid this hotel if all possible
30,Ended up here based on the price Of the hotel and the location. This is the renovated Monte Carlo. Location is pretty good. But check the map. Really depends on what you are doing in Vegas.  Rooms are fine. Not great. Not bad. Originally paid for upgrade upon check in to one of their rooms that is like a petite suite. (Nightingale or something like that) Little larger than regular room. With sofa. Extra space. Those rooms are all in the very center of the building. Same location as elevators. Could hear all conversations when people got off elevators. After not sleeping first nigh moved rooms next morning. I need sleep more than room.  I had paid for a strip view room. They put me in regular random view room. Had to fight to get both suite upgrade off. Along with strip view upgrade off.  Three stars is for the overall feel of hotel. A little darker and dingier than expected. When playing craps tons of leftover drinks were all around the base of crap (where you normall set stuff). Bus the casino people.  Probably won’t stay again unless super cheap. Then good clean option. Clean. Good beds.
50,This was our second stay at Park MGM and we would definitely stay here again. The entire hotel has been renovated although I'm not crazy about the room decor the green carpet in particular. Having said that the rooms are clean comfortable and spacious and the bathrooms are very nice.    We managed to get find a vacation package that offered a dining credit ($30/night per room) making the value of our stay even more attractive. There is a list of participating restaurants across all MGM properties to choose from then simply charge the bill to your room. We returned to Eataly in the Park MGM more than once as the panini pasta and pizza (all made from scratch) were excellent and reasonably priced.    Coffee is very expensive on the Strip with most Starbucks charging $6+ for a brewed coffee. And with the only corporate store on the strip at the Grand Bazaar now closed there is no location to redeem Starbucks rewards to receive free coffee aside from the ones at Fashion Show mall. We ended up bringing a travel kettle (rooms here don't have kettles) and a bag of coffee ($20 total equivalent to 3 coffees) with us and making our own coffee all week.    Another benefit to the Park MGM is the location. It's centrally located in the centre of the Strip so it's easy to walk to any casino. The Park the outdoor eating and entertainment area between the Park MGM and New York New York is also worth visiting. It's a breath of fresh air in the concrete jungle with water features plenty of trees and cobblestone paths. We ended up walking outdoors most of the time as the smoke in the casinos can be overwhelming.    Overall our stay at the Park MGM was very enjoyable!
30,We were in a suite. The room was adequate but that's about it. There were two queen beds and a couch that was a hide-a-bed a round table but only two straight backed chairs. No easy chair or anything of that sort. One sink. There was a fairly elaborate bar area but none of us used it. Seemed like a lot of wasted space. Or space that could have been put to better use. When the hotel converted to the MGM family it would have been nice to put in new mattresses! Very few places to eat. The Primrose was decent but too high priced. Do NOT order room service. The food arrived luke-cold and in cardboard doggie bag type packaging.
40,We enjoyed our room unfortunately the air was not working well and even set at 60degrees it was extremely hot. The casino itself was hot and not inviting to sit and gamble. It would have been nice to have a few choices for food after midnight instead of leaving the hotel in search of food.
40,It’s just ok. Not very personal when checking in had to do my own checking in. Felt like a robot. Room was ok. Some employees are a little rude. Housekeeping was great! Large casino. Restrooms in the casino are far apart. Location is fine.
50,My go-to hotel. The upgrades are great. Rooms are nice. Love the shower! I'm very happy with the addition of Eataly. It has lots of wonderful places to eat. Casino staff is always fun and helpful. Hotel was nice when it was the Monte Carlo but the upgrades really enhance the experience.
50,Once again the park mgm did not disappoint. Had a wonderful time. I cannot wait to come back! Staying at park mgm is great because it is right in the middle of everything. It provides a great atmosphere! Can't wait to return.
40,The location is excellent. Close to many restaurants and the t mobile arena. Room service coffee was terrible and overpriced. Good luck with the line at Starbucks on a weekend morning. Rooms are clean and newly redone. Skip Bavettes steakhouse. Overpriced steaks and Outback quality.
40,Stayed here when it was the Montecarlo a few years ago. They've since remodeled all the rooms and casino floor. The rooms are very nice and the location is perfect. The spa wasn't cheap the but the staff was very nice and the service was excellent. Plenty of dinning options. Great price smaller quieter casino many food options and great location. I'll be staying here again next trip.
50,Excellent Stay - My Favorite on the Strip - i would stay more often in the rates weren't as high as the resorts with better pools amenities - but as far as the rooms - very comfortable - staff is awesome
40,Park MGM is very good and decent hotel friendly staff very helpful and courteous and they act fast and rooms are clean restaurant and food quality is good and hot I would love to comeback again and spend few days as a pleasure trip
40,"My stay was fine. One exception would be the room had no dresser of drawers. The bed mattress could have been firmer. I found ""Eataly"" to be an interesting and unique venue. The staff at check in was very helpful and knowledgeable."
40,The site location is near the beginning of the strip great access to all major freeways railways shuttles and buses but more important is the park one of the places you can pull up a chair and enjoy the scenery the tmobile arena has many entertaining events off the record is a nice nightlife experience and the size of the hotels casino is perfect with all the best games. Also accessible to Asia
30,The rooms are smaller than expected. The door to the restroom is dangerous.The chair is too heavy and the lighting is cheap. The room was clean and well serviced. Parking was a joy as were the parking attendants.
50,I have stayed for over 10 years and love the location. Now that all the remodel is over it is even better than before. Close to all venues and lots of food options. Great if you are going to the Park Theatre.
50,50th Birthday Celebration for my niece was an exceptional fun trip for all 5 of us while we were gambling and dining over the 5-day vacation. I would recommend the MGM Park as ideal location with easy access to Arie Planet Hollywood Bellagio etc.
40,I just spent one night and liked my stay. I did the self check in and out and did not have any contact with any staff which is different and I found it to my liking. Room and casino is very nice. The bed was very low to the floor and was nice. The casino sports bar is not to my liking. You have to have bar service and get a table to watch the TVs. Lots of TVs but no large one. Liked the MGM sports betting are a better. Parking was good and location of the hotel is good on the strip.
30,Very millennial/young geared hotel. Kiosks for checkin and checkout no personal service.  Found rooms to be immaculate but very simple. Nice size recently renovated. Pretty shower. No coffee maker or refrigerator which was disappointing. TV is large and swivels out from wall for comfortable viewing from the bed.  Great Starbucks. Long line moved very quickly. Well staffed. Super high priced though. Bottle of water $6.50!    Had room service for breakfast to use up a $50 room credit. Food was okay but super overpriced ($20 for an omelette)  and served in disposable containers with disposable utensils. Tacky.    Casino had nice variety of machines.
50,Park is a great place. I love the location and the Eataly. Only thing I would change is that their poker games are older. There isn’t enough poker games available. Customer service is great and they did a great job on the remodel.
20,First day there already tired was hoping to get a good nights sleep but rooms walls are way to thin you can hear everything. Doesn't help when you also have a door for an extension and they are yelling and partying like theirs no tomorrow. Filed a complaint but wasn't dealt with so had head down to the lobby and demand to be moved to another room didn't get a room till almost 5am!
50,Always a great stay here at this hotel and casino. You wouldn’t even have to leave the hotel if you didn’t want to. They have to very thing. I had a 12 dollar hamburger and a 75 dollar steak in the same hotel different restaurants. Highly recommend staying. Near city center.
40,Fantastic Casino with great service and very affordable min tables. Great room with street view. On the second day of my stay I was wrongly served pork sausages instead of chicken that I had asked cause digestive trouble.
40,I like that there was a 24hrs service in the lobby shop and the cashier from Japan was extra nice and very polite and thats very good for business. The Starbucks was especially perfectly located and I was very productive conducting my meetings there.
50,Park MGM had Good location good restaurants. I recommend the hotel. All situation the hotel is valuable. Especially my favorite is the noodle restaurant with Asian food and EATLY as well. You should choose there.
10,Requested a fridge for medication took 30 min to deliver and when it did finally arrive they placed it on the floor in the middle of the room. Cool. Bathroom is nothing to write home about. Room looks way better in pictures. They gave me a room at the end of the hall which is a good two minute walk. View wasn’t special either. Casino is small lots of tables. The ONLY Good thing was the Starbucks right outside the elevator. But if they had coffee makers in the room I would have been so much happier. Bell desk took an extremely long time to bring the bags up then waited around for a tip. Charged $50 for valet for 2 days. Really? No thanks.
50,Stayed here with friends over New Year in a nightingale suite. Only minor complaint about suite was no fridge in room.  2 settees in room allows for plenty of room.  Large bathroom and nice shower.  Highlight of the stay was the live band after the fireworks.  Top job 👏👏
40,Very well laid out Hotel / Casino easy access to Tram Nice Restaurants most impressive was the Italian courtyard in rear of casino done on an Italian theme with a variety of fine food selection. Sports bet area is very nice as well enormous TV screens. Staff very helpful.
50,Normally stay at Aria but tried Park MGM for first time. Highly recommend. The rooms are modern clean and the staff is friendly. The table limits are fair and the location is grea . You are connected to Aria and NYNY is across the street.
50,We stayed at the Park January 11th 2020. Everything was awesome - starting from the valet service to the incredibly easy checkin to the rooms. The beds where extra comfy and there were actually 4 towels in the bathroom! We will definitely return.
30,Honestly disappointing considering this property just underwent a pretty massive renovation. The room was sparse and pretty small. Limited dining options particularly on the casual end. I do enjoy upscale meals but not for every single meal of the day and there really aren't any quick or casual options outside of a starbucks in the lobby. Pool looked really small glad it was winter. Walls were pretty thin could hear my neighbors. Overall a decent property but with so moany other options in the same price range I doubt I'll be back.
10,The management is completely rude. When you check out they add their own tip on your bill!? They also recommended the heck out of “Manzo” which should not be up and running until they hire better employees to provide better customer service. Overall won’t go back.
50,Friendly Staff from host craps pit bosses and dealers. Easy check in/out. Newly remodeled and a great value. Comfortable beds and pillows and was spotless. Can’t be the location as next door to T- mobile arena and in the middle of the strip. Strongly recommend. Great value for your money.
40,This was my first stay at Park MGM. I would stay there again. The room was clean. It did not have much for storage (no dresser small closet) but that worked for me. Great location and very nice staff in the casino.
40,"Stayed at the hotel during a convention. Had an absolutely amazing dinner at NoMad in the hotel. Was simply fantastic. Also tried several other establishments in the Casino including Starbucks and La La Noodle. Highly recommend La La Noodle as well. The hotel room is actually very large and spacious. Designed primarily in modern decor.    My only major complaint with the property was the water pressure in the shower. There was none. Water ""fell"" out of the shower head more than it was sprayed. If you are a fan of a long hot shower with good water pressure...this is not the place for you. Really took away from what could have been a great room experience."
30,No coffeemakers or fridge in room no fan in bathroom either. A/C in room was not working properly it was too hot or too cold. Where are the ice machines? Not enough check in/out personnel to help with troubleshooting.
30,Room not enough to 4 stars hotel Sofa not clean enough; no refirgator; Bed light 's too close together; Towels not clean enough; Tissue box keep to use OLD refill for 2 days only; they tried to save shampoo conditioner body wash and lotion.
10,Poor service and zero quality. Save your money and spend on a real hotel.if you want motel quality then I guess stay here. Clearly staff at this property need more customer service training. Hotel management is absent. Reviews on yelp and other platforms support there needs to be a change in management.
20,I booked a trip with Travelocity. Pretty simple reservation and I didn't get a deal considering the hotel and Vegas. I paid over $200 a night for the room. It included a $30 per person credit at the hotel and a king bed. That is it. Neither were honored. After 18 years of marriage we took a week too ourselves and spent it in queen beds without the credit guaranteed. I reported it a couple of times to the staff with the same answer - we do not honor third party commitments.
40,Having stayed in many Las Vegas hotel rooms for business travel I give the Park MGM an overall high rating. Primarily for the comfy beds large bathrooms/nice shower and cleanliness. Close to MGM and NYNY. Good but not great restaurant options. Would like to see an overhaul on the sports bar...
10,For the money it was a very mediocre room. Pillows were awful room was sparse no coffee or hot water in the room no basics like tea. Awful closet. No desk. Small table with power far away. Design and art in the room was good but that’s all I can say positive about it.    The kiosk based checkin and check out was good but my name was wrong and that required a human. All for much more than $2000 for 5 nights. :/
30,My husband and I where there for the hockey tournaments at the t-mobile arena  the connivence of hotel to arena was great ! Beds were very comfortable . I think restaurant prices were very high  and I had to pay for parking twice
10,Worst experience with Management in a Vegas hotel out of many. I was never refund what was promised at time of checkout. Extremely dissatisfied with management poor customer service. Do not recommend to stay at this hotel
40,Basic accommodations located convenient to everything on the Strip. Friendly service good dining selection but I would expect more from a Las Vegas Strip hotel in terms of room quality. Don't over pay for this basic hotel but so stay here if you get a good deal and want convenience without the high cost.
30,Rooms were poorly thought out. Walls are paper thin could hear our neighbor talking could hear music from the street the bathroom/closet door were combined and on a slider. The door was heavy and dangerous if you wanted to close it for the bathroom but the other person was using the closet you could hurt them. I could hear our neighbor open her blinds every day because it was on a chain that was loud. Not impressed for a newly renovated hotel. Only positive was Eatly food court and location on the strip.
50,My husband and I had some issues with our bank when we were checking in and the check in team and managers on duty were amazing in working it out with us so we could get into our room. After flying and waiting a year for a weekend without the kiddos the beautiful king room that we entered sealed the deal of the Park MGM Hotel being our number one pick on the Strip. Thank you for helping us out in a hard time and for being very pleasant! And shout out to Catherine Andrea and Charles for your care and understanding. We wouldn't have had such a fun and restful weekend without your help.
50,The price was right as we changed from another hotel after we arrived in Vegas. The check-in was so smooth that we thought it was impossible. The room was ready early & the hostess only had to show me which button to push to swipe my drivers license on their self check-in machines. Awesome! No line no wait!
30,The park MGM is one of my favorite hotels to stay at in Las Vegas. I have stayed there a Couple of times now. This time unfortunately I did have a problem in the beginning with hair in my sheets and a stain on them. Once I informed the housekeeper outside that the sheets were dirty she did tell me that she had change them but they did not look like they were clean. I did ask her to change them again for me and she dead but only after I had notice all that hair on my sheets..couple of times now. This time unfortunately I did have a problem in the beginning with hair in my sheets and a stain on them. Once I informed the housekeeper outside but the sheets were dirty she did tell me that she had change them but they did not look like they were clean. I did ask her to change them again for me and she dead but only after I had notice all that hair on my sheets.
40,Conveniently located hotel. Large but relatively a smaller footprint than the large casino hotels on the strip so easier to navigate especially with children. Nice hotel but not lush. Helpful staff.
40,I had a great stay with Park MGM. The rooms were excellent and clean. I had a very good nights sleep. The rooms were nice inside and I felt very comfortable. It was a little challenging to get checked in and was very challenging to get checked out at the Kiosk. I really liked staying wtih you.
10,Our reservation was not honored we were put in a room under what we reserved the room was dirty in vacuumed and the floor was more comfortable then the bed. The staff was not friendly and was very confrontational when we brought up our concerns.
10,I was such a fan of the Monte Carlo; it's sad to see what a mess the Park MGM is. I had no one to even say hello to when I arrived. The check in desk is now a self service series of tablets. So not being able to request a low/ high floor near/ away from elevators was concerning for this solo female traveler. My room was half the size of those that the Monte Carlo was. The TV made a horrible cracking sound when I tried to shift it towards the bed so I was afraid to move it any further. My mini- bar was not filled (this comes into play later). There was a dirty maintenance rag left on top of the glassware hair on the bathroom floor some towels and a large very dark scuff on the wall. I had to run to dinner and I encountered a housekeeper in the hallway so I told them the issues. They said they would take care of it but when I returned 6 hours later they had not been fixed. At 2am - 3am there were no available food options open. All stores and restaurants were closed within the casino as well. I didnt want to venture outside alone this late so I retreated to my room to find they didn't fix the mess and that room service was an hour behind on deliveries. At this point I was beyond annoyed and decided I would never stay here again. And this trip was complimentary to boot. What a waste of a $40 resort fee. I moved over the Linq the next day and had a GREAT stay there.
40,Great time overall but Little things that I expected from Park MGM fell short. Staff was nice but the hotel is average. As mentioned before what made the trip better was the friendliness of the staff and the willingness to accommodate us on our honeymoon. Looking forward to coming back and winning some of my money back.
50,location convenient  staff helpful and friendly  not enough seating in Eataly  Eataly pricey  need for affordable eateries  room clean  bed comfortable  need more seatings in general areas  good to have free tram to Bellagio
40,This is a very nice hotel and we enjoyed our stay. The location is perfect and the cleaning staff was wonderful. I do wish there was more variety of food. We went next door and ordered food so we could all get what we wanted but still sit down to eat together.
40,check in via kiosks so i don't think we came across a staff person ever.  room on the smallish side but clean. 3-4 star amenities nothing magnificent.  the best thing about this place is location on the strip and its newer/nicer than the mgm grand.
40,MGM Park great Location Eataly is awesome ! Mama rabbit restaurant good Chicken Cluck next door is good. Convenient location. Primrose nice but thebreakfast menu lacking. Rooms have poor air-conditioning Right across from the arena to go to the hockey game. Close to airport.
40,This is our first time to stay at Park MGM checking in was fast. The rooms were great. No coffee machine no shower cap though the rest was great. The room is clean pillows/bed are great to sleep in.
30,Wish I could give more stars to the hotel because I loved having Eataly right downstairs but I was very disappointed with the guest rooms appearance and the cleanliness were very poor. After having housekeeping fix our room twice the dust was still on the table and the nightstands.
40,We arrived late from Hawaii 1am and tried to check in with the auto checkin kiosks. We needed further assistance so stood in line for the VIP desk. When we initially booked our stay we requested a high floor. None were available so was given a room on the 6th floor with a promise to upgrade yo a higher floor when it became available.  Arriving late there were no restaurants opened 24 hours but could order from room service which we opted not to. We did not want we venture out to another hotel being so early in the morning. Please consider having a 24 hour restaurant since your casino is 24 hours.
50,If you're a hockey fan and you're going to games at the T-Mobile Arena Park MGM is the perfect hotel venue! The Park MGM provides easy access to T-Mobile and easy access to the Vegas Strip. As a hockey fan it was great to see Park MGM staffers wearing NHL Hockey sweaters and it was thrilling to watch all the fans in the hotel. As an added bonus Eatly is a dining destination. We loved having access to both sit-down restaurants and take-away stands and we also loved the wine lists!
50,Hotel is real nice. The room was a nice size as well checking in and out was very fast. I would definitely book another trip and stay at the park. No complaints. It actually the best hotel i stayed at thus far
50,Had a blast with the new Remodel amazing food and new bars...  Would go back again to try all the new restaurants. Eataly is awesome with all sorts of food and drinks... great steaks and pizza and also fish
30,So looking forward to staying here but I was very disappointed in the rooms. Looked like they threw in whatever old pieces they had. Scratched table with only 1 chair odd metal panel on wall under TV instead of dresser. 4 minuscule drawers stuffed inside “closet” that took up most of the hanging space. Not at all easy to live in. So many other nicer rooms in Las Vegas.  Location can t be beat though so if you don’t mind living out of your suitcase on the floor and having to choose between closing bathroom or closet door you’ll do fine
20,Automated service removes personal touch Vegas was known for. Restaurants are average quality with high prices. Rooms are very outdated and small. Great location. I heard the rooms in the Nomad are better.
50,Rooms are spacious beds are comfortable. Valet and baggage were great. Housekeeping was nice enough to throw our trash since we didn’t want the room cleaned. Pool is heated in winter time but closes really early
20,Rooms are very old and run down. No coffee makers in the room or small refrigerators. Room smell like stale cigarettes. And for the price that we paid for the room I would’ve stayed at a better hotel and had better accommodations.
30,The room and bathroom were dirty had to have a housekeeper clean right when we got there. Also smelled like cigarette smoke and so did the hallways. Staff was nice and the Crack shack restaurant and Eatley restaurants were very good.
30,Park MGM has opted for automated check in and check out kiosks to save on personnel costs. Unfortunately for a 50 something like me it means a complete lack of customer service and when that technology isn't working they're doomed. I tried to check in early following the prompts from their email. After I entered ALL of the same info I entered when I booked the room I received an error message and was asked to check in at the hotel. There is no front desk only kiosks and the one we used didn't work. There were about six kiosks to use at check out but three were out of order and there were about fifteen people waiting to use them. The A/C didn't work but we didn't notice until 2:00 am so it was too late to want to wait for repairs or change rooms. One positive: Bavette's Steakhouse id fabulous!
20,I made reservation with Nomad Mlife member customer service But  When i get there they gave me a park MGM hotel room. So i ask them to change to Nomad  they told me all sold out!!!!!!  If they told me about it before i arrive I will try to make res
50,The room was very nice and the staff were extremely friendly. I was not happy that we had to pay for parking. The location of the hotel is right on the Strip so we were right in the heart of all of the action.
40,My first time here. Parking was simple check in was easy and room was simple clean and updated compared to previous Monte Carlo. Rates were fantastic since is it was post New Years. Easy to move around the hotel and access the Strip. Food choices are plentiful and interesting.
30,Having stayed at this location when it was the Monte Carlo I was interested in seeing all the differences with the renovations that have taken place.    First and foremost is the location.It is very convenient.    The place is obviously going for a more upscale feel. Out with the food court. In with Eataly. These added touches obviously come with a higher bill. A morning coffee from Starbucks or Eataly is obviously going to be more than one form Johnny Rockets. We found ourselves eating away from the hotel with even morning coffee coming from across the street. NYNY is right next door and has many more options for more casual and less expensive food.    I liked the auto check in and out. I'm surprised with the number of people complaining about this. Made the whole process so fast compared to standing in long lines to wait for a person to check you in. I would not be surprised that if the auto check in did not exist these very same people would be complaining about the long waits to check in.    The room was ok nothing spectacular. Bathrooms have been upgraded nicely including beautiful showers. Storage space is very limited.    I'm not sure if this was particular to our floor but the hallways are extremely dark making it hard to even see the room numbers. Finishes of dark green and brown may make a nice combo but they got to put in better lighting.    As it was a cool January week I did not go in the pool. Pool area seemed nice but basic.    Main complaints are of course not particular to Park MGM. Lack of coffee pot or fridge in the room is annoying but run of the mill for Vegas where the point is to keep you away from you room as long as possible. Mini bar prices of course were outrageous and it went untouched. The vendors in the hotel were also quite costly but there is a CVS right on the corner. Resort fee is of course highway robbery for which you get absolutely nothing extra but that is the case all over the strip.    All in all a decent place but I'm not sure the reno from Monte Carlo was really worth the price
40,I was in Vegas to see Aerosmith at the Park Theatre and spent a few days at the Park. Check in was a little rough as the automated check-in system was being a bit fussy with our reservation. Got that sorted quickly with the aid of one of the assistants and all went smoothly. The room was nice but a little on the small side. We faced the strip which was nice but unfortunately the roof of the casino stretches the full distance below us. Not a pretty view. The bathroom was more than adequate. Everything was clean. Unfortunately there is no mini fridge in the room. Mixed drinks were extremely expensive $37 for 2. The pool area was okay but nothing spectacular. The casino is nice and not overly busy. We really enjoyed our meals at Eataly although with the concert and an afternoon hockey game next door it was virtually impossible to get a table. Once we did we enjoyed it immensely.    If I were to return I'd definitely consider staying at the Park again due to its great location it really is close to everything. Its not extravagant but it does feel classy.
40,Had a great stay at the park mgm! Enjoyed the newness of the area and renovated simplistic rooms! Shower was amazing bed was on the softer side and gave me some aches and pains  took some getting used to and was my only complaint but overall a fabulous stay!  We walked to all the park area restaurants and the golden knights game had great meals in Eataly the sports bar and lavazza coffee pastries and gelato!  Would definitely come back!  The online checkin and checkout is a little confusing and there is a hold on the rooms which makes your total look like more if they can clarify that it would be perfect! Very easy to use though and convenient!
40,It's not the Bellagio but is a good value with a few less amenities. Casino is decent and has friendly staff. Not overly pretentious nor crowded.    Bars and restaurant options are adequete and it's easy to get to the Aria for some more upscale restaurants and shopping.    Eatily is great love the wine selection in there as well!
40,What a fun New Year's Las Vegas Experience!  Our Suite was amazing and extremely clean.  Two suggestions:  Humans for Check-in  Carafe's of coffee available for in room dining.  The MGM Park is in a great location.
10,We booked directly online but this did not help as we were assigned a room with the worst view. I believe they should only book this room if they warn you of the view. If that is no problem then the room itself was ok. If this hotel had a front desk we would have asked to be moved but it is all automated.
40,My wife and I travel to Vegas a few times a year and have stayed at nearly every strip property. Our most recent trips have included Bellagio Aria and Mirage. We had always resisted staying at Monte Carlo even after it renovated to become Park MGM. However we finally took the plunge and had a great stay at Park MGM.    Park MGM has one of the smaller casinos on the strip but they have done a good job of creating a lot of bang in a smaller space. The entire casino has been nicely renovated and is attractive and inviting. The restaurants bars and lounges offer great variety. We really enjoyed the comfortable and fun vibe at Juniper Lounge but there was also a very nice sports bar and tequila bar. The new Eataly area (basically an upscale Italian food court) is a dining experience itself. We liked that the casino had music throughout including a band in the middle of the casino band in the Mama Rabbit tequila bar and a DJ at Juniper Lounge. The entire casino had a fun vibe with lots of energy.    Overall the rooms at Park MGM are pretty average even though they have been renovated and they are certainly not on par with the luxury of upper tier properties. The rooms are considerably smaller which is what you get with an older property and you don't get floor to ceiling windows. However the bathrooms were surprisingly nice and spacious and the shower was as big as what you get at some of the best properties. The room had a larger flat screen TV and the memory foam beds were very comfortable. The decor and lighting was lacking but the black-out curtains were very effective.    We only had a few complaints with the property. The biggest was probably the drab and dreary room hallways. The hallways had a dark gray and deep green color scheme with very dim overhead lighting. They reminded me of the decor at the old THEhotel before it became Delano. It felt like being in an underground tunnel. Another problem was the very limited drawer and closet space in the rooms. Lastly as other reviewers have mentioned was the sliding door for both the closet and bathroom. The closet and bathroom cannot be both opened or closed at the same time. This was a bit of a hassle when two people need to access the bathroom and closet at the same time. It was not the best design even for a smaller room.    We found the service at Park MGM to be very good. We had a sink clog that was quickly fixed. We also had a long check-in due to a reservation error (which was not the fault of anyone at Park MGM). However Alex at VIP check-in helped fix the problem and was very accommodating in giving us a better room view and a nice resort credit to make-up for the delayed check-in.    No property is perfect and many people will always find something to complain about even at the best properties. However for people who can focus more on the good things Park MGM has a lot to offer and is in a good location and I am sure we will stay there again at some point.
40,The only downside is zero bathtubs but loved the hotel atmosphere upgraded to a suite totally worth it! The restaurants bars were all great! The staff were all super friendly too which makes the stay even better
10,The worse then you want to charge me for valet 25.00 a day and it took them both time 20 minutes to get my truck this place e really sucks and I go to Vegas alot never again will I stay there charge that much and it takes that long
50,I very much enjoyed my stay at park mgm. I really liked the automated function upon checkin however I could have used a little more staff involvement in the experience. I would stay at another MGM resort in the future.
50,Great location with clean nice rooms! This hotel is in the middle of everything. They have so many places to eat inside the hotel. Pasta pizza steak or a excellent steak/ hamburger! You cant go wrong staff are friendly and helpful.
10,Dirty needs updating new colors so dark  more a younger vibe  vary old looking ..I prefer anywhere else but here the Starbucks was good and the rooms were clean the shower was new  The hallway is really dark
10,The room was uncomfortable to be in. The floor was slanted giving it a fun house effect. The air in the room was humid and stuffy after every cleaning. Was sent 2 emails to precheck-in. The first link told me that this feature was not available at this property. The 2nd attempt took my info but then said that an error occurred.
30,No Coffee Pot Mini Fridge or Microwave in rooms. Stood in line at Starbucks for 45 Mins to get coffee options very limited. Room got very stuffy and hot at night and temp was set on 60 degrees. Very hard to sleep. Standup shower only with no sit down area. Bed is a one piece unit with side tables. There is a very small crack between the wall and the table top. My bracelet slid off in there and we had to call someone to get it out. I'm sure this happens quite a bit. There's no way it couldn't. Definitely needs to be addressed. Bed was very comfortable and pillows very nice. Staff was very polite and accomodating. Check in and out on self serv Kiosk which I liked. Nice Casino and Restaurant options. Located centrally on the strip which was very nice for the New Year's Eve fireworks.
50,PERFECT. Above and Beyond. Royal Treatment. Treated like family. Excellent service throughout entire hotel.Room service food was exceptional. The staff at the front desk was supreme. The house keeping was immaculate.
20,I have State in better properties in some time with their two times within a year my husband’s birthday and after Christmas up until New Year’s I have stayed at the Mirage which we really wanted to stay there they didn’t have anything open for us I stayed at the mandolin day I’ve stayed at treasure Island but out of most of those we really do like the Moroge they didn’t have the suite that we want it I think they told us we had to be high rollers so at the time the park MGM told is the Blackhawk was available and that’s what I went with
10,It was the worst experience I’ve ever had staying at a hotel in Vegas. We decided to stay onsite for the Lady Gaga concert. Big mistake! To start it off I was given 2 for 1 drink coupons for a couple bars at Park MGM. Neither bar honored the coupons. The rooms were terrible. Both the pillows and the sheets were the cheapest material I’ve ever encountered. What a ridiculous door in the room too ... one door that slides for the bathroom and closet? There’s 2 beds and very limited drawer space.    The 24 hour Eataly serving station ran out of food after we (and many others) waiting in line for 30 minutes. No warning at all. They kept allowing people to stand in line before they broke the news. The Eataly food seating area does not have enough chairs and tables to handle all the patrons. Every time I went though that area many patrons were walking around carrying their food waiting for seating.    The other restaurant advertised as 24 hours was not open 24 hours. And the resort fee what is that for? No one mans the pool/jacuzzi the gym also was locked on a couple occasions ... not 24 hours.    And you can check my MLife. I gambled thousands while experiencing this horrible hotel. It was very difficult to get a waitress to bring yiu a drink sometimes they just “forgot”.
30,Casino hosts don’t seem to give personal attention to players. The room are not great and the price of parking is absurd. The Eataly section is great and I had did enjoy playing and talking to the dealers. The best thing about the hotel are the shows. Brian newman and lady Gaga are the only thing that would bring me back
50,Great place but I wish the beds were more lush. Check in was a breeze. Room was ready before checking time. Staff everywhere were amazing and courteous. Casino and hotel was clean. The only thing they are missing is a 24 hour eating place.
30,"Had to pay a $400 fee at check in on case I charged anything to my room was told it would be refunded. Check in was only by computer stations with only one employee to assist about 20 people. Mimi bar items were so over priced that the bottle of water was $16. Also if you picked up an item for more than 60 seconds you were charged for the item. No a place for some one with kids.    No one to help with check out. Had a $167 charge with no explanation and no one to help. Turned out to be a ""$40+ resort fee"" that should of been part of the prepaid package like the taxes were.    Also did not get my wake up call and there were no clocks in the room."
40,Overall experience was great. However the beds are very hard and it made it very difficult to get a good night sleep. Check in processing is very nice all automated. The valet service is very nice and helpful
30,Great location room ok but basic. No tub no refrigerator no coffee maker in room. I would not go out of my way to stay there again. Liked the options for dinning at Eataly. Don't get the thin crusted pizza a(i Napolitano) was undercooked and doughy ( not in a good way). Grilled items pasta or the thicker to medium pizza better.
40,We drove by Vegas to Utah for a ski trip and chose Park MGM to stay. The hotel location on the Strip is great and has easy tram access to the Bellagio Shops at Crystals etc and there is a great Eataly food court.    Derek the hotel lobby host was super nice and helpful when I needed help with a room situation and checkout. Jordan the concierge was helpful too. Great service!!  We will come back again hopefully to see Lady Gaga and Aerosmith in concert at the hotel venue.
40,If you're going to the Park Theater this is the perfect location. Very clean and well kept. Easy access to everything. Food is somewhat limited and expensive but easy access to other restaurants. Thoroughly enjoyed our stay!
40,I stayed at the Monte Carlo years ago and loved the decor so I was disappointed in the decision to make Park MGM the way it is it's just so boring on the outside. However the hotel itself is nice. I had a king room. The room was a good size with plenty of room. There was a couch backed against the window with a view of the strip (well some of it mostly Eatalys roof from the low floor I was on 14). The bed was comfortable the pillows were huge and fluffy. Plenty of outlets for charging. No fridge which is normal but always a bummer. Room was quiet there was music playing Friday night but I could barely hear it basically a low white noise like drone.    Check in was a bit of a hassle. I did mobile check in however when my room was ready I had to go to the podium because their system messed up and I had to get a little help. But after that was smooth sailing check out was a lot easier.    The location is quite nice for the south end of the strip. The new pedestrian bridge makes it easy to get to the Showcase mall and MGM Grand. There is a fast walkway to Aria and the Crystals which leads easily to the Cosmo. And of course the tram to Bellagio makes it easy to get center strip. The Park is a nice little area between Park MGM and NYNY with some good eats. Definitely recommend Bruxies. They were also playing the Knights game in the park and projected on the T-Mobile Arena.
20,We stayed at the park mgm when it first opened and it was great! The hotel has great restaurant options like “Eataly” and the “Best Friends” Korean joint. This time around most things were still good but the two rooms we had book were horrible. There was throw up crust in the sinks. There was stains on the towels and the sheets. The table was crusty the ac was not working causing it to be so stuffy in the room. The Tv was not working as well. When we finally talked to the front desk they were only able to offer us one night of no resort fees. We came with my whole family including 2 small children so cleanliness was expected. The location of the park mgm and the restaurants makes us want to come a back but the rooms... no thanks.
30,Green tea scent in the rooms was pleasant. Room cleanliness and amenities were average. Eataly is a nice marketplace in the hotel where you can get delicious pizza pasta and gelato. Conveniently located - walking distance to other attractions on the strip.
10,They try to rip you off when you go and check in the bag man tries to rip you off the IP tries to rip you off nobody's there to help their computer tablets go down they give you a run around there's no organization in that whole place. On professional and the entrance is very blah and simple I thought I was in the mountains
40,I like the kiosk check-in it was easy and there was a friendly employee there to help us if needed. We got a room on the 22nd floor. Elevators were always fast never really had to wait at all. Room was good. Bed was comfortable as were the pillows. No noise really heard although we do bring a sound machine to sleep with. They do need another garbage can in the main room the only one was the in the bathroom. Good TV channels as well. The shower was AMAZING seriously one of the best hotel showers I have used the water pressure and large shower were wonderful. The one negative is no fridge. Regarding the hotel itself I like the size of it. Easy to get through easy access to the strip and T-Mobile Arena. I do wish they had more affordable food choices as we didn't eat at the hotel at all. Good thing for CVS on one side and NYNY on the other side!
10,"I have been Vegas for many times (4 times in 2019 alone). For twice in my life I got unrecognized extra billing one from Mirage and another from Park MGM - both are MGM's hotel brands. This was my second time staying at Park MGM (won't stay here again) because it was convenient for Lady Gaga's concert. My experience was terrible! Like many other have said the self check in/out machine was bad. I had two rooms under my name but none of them was correctly checked in on the machine. Then I had to talk to one of the associates with tablets on their hands to get my room keys. You think it's over? Nope. Still error message when I checked out - the last step where you agreed on the room charge. Then I had to talk to an associate again but this time he didn't use the tablet and instead asked me to chech out AGAIN. Two days later I found out one room charge (nearly $300) was charged twice on my credit card: not pending but actual charges. It might be because of the error when checking out. So like last time for Mirage I needed to contact the billing department. Here is the thing: on their website they want you to send a message and wait for a reply within 10 business days. NO WAY for me. I need to talk to a person. I asked an operator to transfer my call and then literally waited for about 40 minutes before a representative was available! OMG she had such a bad attitude. Sometimes when she wanted to check something in the system she just went completely silent without telling me to hold on the phone. I was like ""hello?"" She was like ""I'm here"" then silence again. She first said the room was charged once. I said twice. After another silence she found my credit card WAS charged twice for the amount for the same room. Ok now she needed to send a request to the credit department (different from billing department??) I was told to wait for 10 days because it needed manual fix. I thanked her in spite of her attitude and 10-day wait.    I am unlikely to stay at any MGM brands again because of two bad billing experiences AND lack of customer care/ quality of customer service."
30,Nicely redone hotel with great location. Easy access to MGM NYNY shopping the T Mobile Arena. would like the Monarail to be closer and more user friendly. Smoking is still a casino issue but I think our room was smoke free possibly the floor we stayed on also. In fairness I have not been in Vegas regularly for a few years. It certainly has changed this is a great place for a pretty luxe vacation. Almost like a cruise ship on land with better food.
10,Worst service at any MGM hotel. Guest services was horrible and representatives kept contracting each other n made excuses for horrible service. Room was not serviced for se real days and when finally it was no amenities were left for us to use.
50,This hotel is one of the best hotels that I being so far. Location service food was amazing. Transportation is easy to take. Using the tram to go to other hotels were satisfactory.  The price is good if you don’t want to stay in a luxury hotel.
50,Great quick unexpected getaway with the family. Loved the casino remodeling and great service. Great location! Victoria was has been the best blackjack dealer ever and believe me when I tell you I’ve been doing this a long time! (Lol) Keep up the great work! Will see you soon.
30,Attempted to stay overnight NYE to see Lady Gaga and eat at the restaurant at Park MGM. I think MGM has done decent in terms of renovation however the staff at several restaurants appear inexperienced and naive. Service I would say was sub-par. Staff tender to be curt. I often found myself standing in lines needlessly due to inattention and disorganization. In terms of check-out I paid for late check-out but was told it wasn't available due to new years. Great location but corporate needs to do better.
50,friendly helpful staff. quick and efficient check in/check out. valet and luggage people were very kind and professional! Lady Gaga did such a great show at the Park Theater! i will definitely be back i love this place!
30,Overall didn’t love our stay.  The check in experience was not good (had to use a confusing kiosk and flag down an employee multiple times to fix incorrect room assignment and answer some questions).  Room was clean remodeled and surprisingly large - very nice bathroom with a big shower. The decor was a bit off-putting and the heater made some strange noises but we had plenty of space! Few amenities though - no fridge cups or ice bucket in the room. What kind of hotel doesn’t have cups?! Only drinking option was the room temperature $16 minibar water. The minibar is a small open tray at child-eye level full of the standard overpriced candy that in teeny tiny little print says you will be charged for any item removed from the tray for more than 60 seconds (even if you put it back!)  Lobby/casino isn’t anything special to look at and we didn’t eat at any of the restaurants.  Honestly unless you really care about floor space and remodeled bathrooms you can get more amenities for less $$ elsewhere.
50,Love staying at the Park MGM in Vegas. We’ve been multiple times and absolutely love this hotel it’s amenities staff restaurants etc! Eataly is a must do. Beds are soft and comfy and the casino is a reasonable size perfect for fun gambling but also easy to get to the strip and other areas quickly without a 20 minute walk.
20,Horrible experience when my mother hurt herself. It took me 20 mins to get someone on the phone for a wheelchair assist. Later on a separate occasion I ordered a wheelchair in advance and it wasn’t ready and had to wait another 15 mins. We’re taking a 75year old hurt woman who was completely disregarded.
40,We stayed here over New Years to celebrate a 40th birthday. It was the first time we’ve stayed here though we’d all been to Vegas before.    The hotel has automated check-in machines which assign your room and print your key on arrival you don’t speak to a hotel representative unless you have a problem. They offer an app to online check in but the app wasn’t working the day we travelled in.    I had booked a strip view room but checked in late at night and didn’t realise I didn’t have a strip view room until the next morning. I didn’t end up finding someone to talk to about it until I was checking out (also automated) and they ended up comping me the resort fees for the mixup. Good customer service.    The 13th floor room was otherwise spacious and clean with ample non bed space to sit. The shower had great pressure and was large. The bathroom door doesn’t lock and the door is shared between the closet and the bathroom - it slides so only one can be closed at a time - which might be off putting to some guests but didn’t bother me at all.    Both days our room wasn’t cleaned until 5pm just when we were coming back after being out all day to change for dinner. Annoying but I guess the checkout rooms get priority.    The hotel has ample elevators and we never had to wait long to access one.    The casino is nice there was a good cover band playing in the evenings we were there and the attached Eataly food area is excellent great cocktails sorbet coffee and pastries. Some of our group lamented the lack of a poker room in the casino. Bar staff were prompt bringing drinks when we were playing at a table.    There is a free tram connecting the MGM to the Bellagio and we used this to head quickly farther down the strip as needed.    Overall we liked the hotel and location and had a great vacation. Would stay here again.
30,Hotel had a good location and nice to have Eat Italyi but long lines and poor check in with computer only. Concierge not that knowledgeable. Rooms clean and comfortable. Good views available. Would go again if better price..
30,Hotel room average suffered with a barking dog most of our first night even after we called security twice. Was able to change rooms in the morning. The food choices throughout the hotel are rather weak and not very diverse. Had to go to other hotels to get a better selections of food
30,Unless you specifically want to attend an event at T Mobil Arena please avoid Park MGM because of all of the congestion both cars and people that will prevent you from entering or exiting the Park in a timely manner during T Mobil events which seems to be at least twice a week. I have stayed here four times now twice before the T Mobil was up and running. It was much more relaxed at that time. Now it is an area on steroids. There is no easy way to enter or exit the hotel or the parking garage during event times. You can hear the noise from the arean even inside of your hotel room.    I cannot figure out why the walls in the newly renovated hotel rooms are painted a bright red and bright red sofas also in each room. Red is definitely not a relaxing color and you would think that after a day on the strip one might need the respite of a nicely colored hotel room without noise from the T Mobil arean right across the street. Before the arena was there you could have a fabulous view of the strip and the mountains (if you are in a room facing Park Drive or Frank Sinatra Drive. Now most of the beautiful mountain view is obstructed sadly. You get to view constant ads on the face of the T Mobil Arena instead from your hotel room.
10,Check in experience felt like an airport check in with kiosks. Absurd that a hotel charging $379/night would force their guests to check themselves in. No interaction at all with front desk so couldn’t add husband to room. Dispensed keys did not work so bad to return to check in again. Rooms were small and distasteful decor.
30,We stayed here with friends to celebrate my husband’s retirement. Our friends stayed at this hotel pre-renovation and we decided to try again.  The Good:  Restaurants: we ate multiple times at various options in Eataly. All were great. We also ate at Babette and Primrose with good experiences at both. The brief trip out to the Crack Shack was great too!    Location: It was convenient to walk to Aria and NYNY plus an easy tram ride to Bellagio.    The SoSo:    Room: Our king room was clean and spacious with a walk in shower and a nice view over TMobile arena into the snow covered mountains. However storage space is lacking and the walls were terribly thin. I was annoyed by loudly partying neighbors and our friends could hear children on one side and dogs on another.    Sports Book/Bar: while the TVs and seating was nice and it was not as crowded as other sports books we have frequented service was spotty.    Pools: While only one was open during our stay they seemed quite basic and susceptible to shade very quickly for a sun lover.    The Bad:  The Casino Experience: Ventilation is non existent. I could not tolerate playing for more than a half hour at a time.    Bottom line I would visit again to eat or drink but will look elsewhere to sleep and play.
50,Mgm the City of entertainment! Best place to stay on the strip! Great rooms restaurants and staff. Best entertainment and everything Vegas has to offer is within steps from the hotel. Rooms are large and extremely well taken care of. Thanks MGM for a great stay see you soon!!
40,I have had the opportunity to stay at the Park MGM on a few occasions since their remodel. I was in town for a hockey game and this hotel is right next door to T-Mobile Arena. If you are going to a hockey game this place is perfectly located! In fact we were in one of bars after a game one night and Nate Schmidt came in for a drink. So for hockey fans Park MGM or NYNY are ideally located and I think Park MGM is a bit nicer. It's now $23 for a cab from the airport with the new flat fee pricing. It used to be $16 before the flat fee pricing went into effect. This last trip we took 20-somethings who wanted to go clubbing and the location was great! They had a nice club at the Park MGM or you could walk to Aria (inside walking the whole way) or across the street to MGM for Hokasan. So for clubbing it's a great location! The pool is pretty average but they do have pools and hottubs and both were open even in very cold December. They do not a regular check-in desk but instead have computers with a few roving employees with Ipads to help if you can't figure out the computers. It was ok. Elevators at times were very crowded in the lobby but I reminded myself how cheap our room was and I didn't worry about it. There is a Starbucks in the lobby which can get extremely busy at times as it's next to the meeting spaces. They wouldn't give us a late check-out even if we paid for it which I thought was crummy as we only asked for a half hour. Primrose restaurant was great for breakfast but very expensive. Rooms were small but fine. You heard some noise from neighbors but not an uncommon amount.Overall it was a 3.5+. If you are expecting the Four Seasons you won't be happy but if you are expecting a typical Marriott/Sheraton you'll probably find this to be just fine. Casino is not huge but plenty big and was very lively on the weekend. Also artists like Bruno Mars Lady Gaga and Aerosmith play at the venue inside the hotel so obviously great location if you are going to one of them. Oh ya one BIG negative was almost all restaurants close by 11 or 12 at night even on a very busy December 30th. Was very odd that we had to leave the hotel to go to Shake Shack which was just across the street and open until 2. They say Vegas is a 24 hour city and ya you can drink gamble and dance all night but not eat! Lastly the gym is small for a hotel of this size and gets very full.
50,It was our first time staying at the Park MGM. I would definitely consider returning my next trip to Las Vegas. Plenty of healthy food options in the resort & nearby. And I am very selective about what I eat.
40,We liked the property and loved the location. We loved “Eataly” and the fried chicken place. The steak house Bavettes was the highlight of the stay. I would definitely recommend MGM Park to a friend for a couples vacation.
30,This property is in a great location. It’s dark going in the entry ways to the hotel rooms but the rooms are clean and bright. The air quality inside the casino is terrible. The ceilings are low and it doesn’t seem like they have a filtration system for the smoke inside the casino.
50,Park MGM was a Great experience. This was our first stay and we’d definitely recommend to friends and family. Location was great and central to all other casinos. Very clean and friendly staff. Variety of restaurants that were all amazing.
40,I recommend visiting this hotel.Convenient with an automatic check-in out system. The hotel room is clean and the bedding is good. It was good to park together at MGM Grand Hotel. The parking fee is fifteen dollars a day.
20,The facility looks good from the outside. You think you're going in a nice classy Hotel. The lobby is obsobluly chaos. Everyone has to self check in. Worthless customer service. 17th floor hallways is soooo outdated with carpet /paint it looked like dark dungeon OMG!!...my wife wanted to leave. I will never go back until they update that facility and change to check in to actual people registering me in to accomandate special needs and other concierge services..
50,Enjoyed a wedding anniversary at Park MGM. Hotel was nice and offered great restaurants and a fun club (on the record). We saw Lady Gaga and it was fantastic to stay and the same place. Rooms were clean and staff was very helpful
50,Got a great deal on this hotel during an Expedia sale. Booked it because I had tickets to see Britney’s new residency. When the residency got cancelled we decided to still go to Vegas. The hotel was amazing. There were 4 pools that were beautiful but not too wild (they do also have a pool party but if you would rather chill with normal music and a cocktail the pools are great!). The room was a little small but that’s to be expected with the deal I got and we were only in there to sleep and shower anyways. We did not dine in any of the fine dining restaurants but they all looked delicious. I loved having eataly there for afternoon snacks and a glass of wine! The gym was great and had lots of equipment to get a great hotel work out. The location is also fantastic centrally located to easily get to either end of the strip. I couldn’t be happier with our home base and I plan to stay here every time I visit LV!
30,I’ve had my fair share of staying around the strip and wanted to try Park MGM after the big remodel and rebranding.    The Good:  It’s hard to beat the location. You are a tram ride from Aria and Bellagio across the side street from NYNY and not too far from the MGM Grand and it’s monorail (if you want it). There’s a super convenient and large CVS nearby.    Eatily is pretty amazing. I only stopped in for some quick hits. I found the pizza slice place on the bottom level to be excellent. Quick and easy.    The Nomad Bar is hidden down a hallway and worth seeking out.    Checkin was super easy on the kiosks. I bypassed a line of folks waiting to deal with human reception. The kiosk offers you the ability to upgrade if available.    I was in a King room overlooking the pool and looking out to Aria. I had a bathtub shower and a regular bathroom door but I noticed as I walked to and from my room that there seemed to be a lot of room variation. Some had showers only others had larger seating areas.    The not so good:  There is very little storage. A cubby hole in either side of the bed and a freestanding IKEA quality armoire. It was so small that the hangers hung front to back which was frustrating. It was fine for one but would be super tight for two.    You could tell the old room layout. The “bed nook” was obviously the old closet. The new layout definitely provides a lot of space.    The walls are thin. I heard random bits of  conversation on either side of me (yet surprisingly never heard a TV). In the bathroom I could hear some child singing while bathing. That said it wasn’t terrible.    The sinks are square and look terrible to keep clean. Maid service was great though. I never returned to an undone room. And the platform bed was comfortable.    I checked out via the TV which was super simple.
10,Absolutely horrible experience. Not only not at all likely to recommend to a friend I will all out warn my friends from this property until they fix a lot of things. I booked a stay well room. When I arrived I was assigned a room. As we got to our first room it dirty & my 2 year old son found & ate food off the floor my wife was livid. Also the air purifier wasn’t working. W sex e promptly left that room it was disgusting. Next the manager tried to help by giving us a regular room. We like the stay well rooms better as we have used them at the MGM Grand. Finally the manager said you know what go grab some food and when you get back we will have your stay well room ready for you. Just as he said we returned and the room was ready. We went up and we noticed there wasn’t that distinctive smell we are used to in a stay well room. We checked the acents device and their was no scent coming from it and further inspection it had no scent puck in it. My wife saw the house keepers just next door in the original room we were given that was dirty. The first house keeper couldn’t speak English and couldn’t help my wife. She motioned to a male house keeper. He walked up to my wife in a rude tone and said “What do you want?” no hint of politeness. She told him the puck was gone and the aromatherapy device wasn’t working. He was rude again we don’t have those things. She came back to the room told me the ordeal so I called guest services. When I told the lady the device wasn’t working she said “OK” and was silent until I said well can you fix that? She said an engineer had to replace this puck. We thought that was weird because we saw house keeping do it at the MGM Grand. Anyways after 6 requests & over 5-6hrs finally someone came and put the scent puck in the aromatherapy device. We had a show planned and as I got out of the shower we had 30mins before we had to leave room I went to to grab the iron & ironing board but there was no ironing board so I was unable to wear what I planned to wear that night & had to wear a dirty shirt which wasn’t as wrinkled. Oh wait there is more... After we got back from the show we wanted to make ourselves some drinks so I went to grab the ice bucket... guess what? No ice bucket. The Stay Well rooms at the MGM are so quite and peaceful they relieve stress and give you restful sleep. That was the opposite with the Park property. For some reason house keeping was on the floor late at night and had a walkie talkie blaring in the hallways. My wife had to go ask them to turn it off. After that they just were in the hallways speaking very loudly. There was no Stay Well aspect to our visit to Park MGM. Very disappointing.
40,I loved that the room had a small sofa by the window. My daughter loved to stay and see the outside. The room had a very good view. I also loved that the hotel New York is very close and in walking distance. The park in from of park mgm is beautiful at night. We went during december and that had a santa taking pictures.
40,The Park MGM is recently renovated and the rooms inside are pretty nice. We stayed for a week in a suite and really enjoy our stay. However my one complaint is that the walls were very thin so we can hear our neighbors coughing or talking late at night.
30,We had stayed here previously when the property was the Monaco and for the same purpose to attend the CBS Sports Classic. What makes the place nice is the proximity to the event just walk across the street.  The rooms were nice a bit modern rather spartan. The shower was great great water pressure.  The big drawback was that the walls in these rooms must be made of paper. You could clearly here conversations music laughter as if you had only a curtain separating you. I don't know if when they did the remodel they sit up one room into 2 but we had folks on both sides of us that could be heard in their respective rooms. Fortunately they didn't carry on the partying late into the night.  It wasn't a bad stay but I might look elsewhere on the strip for any future visit just because of this fact.
30,The rooms at Park MGM was clean however the hallway carpeting should be changed (they looked filthy). The casino was clean but the smoke smell turned us off. Overall there is only one casual eatery place there called Eatily which is expensive.
50,One of the best Las Vegas hotels with best value next to the T-mobile arena. Whether you go to a Knights Hockey game a basketball game or concert there staying here and oarking here makes Park MGM a very good
10,This place charges for everything from parking to asking for a spoon in your room to you name it. You are better off staying at other resorts that actually make you feel like they value your business.
40,Pros: Location quiet and clean rooms tram to Aria and Bellagio    Cons: No refrigerator and microwave    Overall it was a pleasant experience. Self Check-in wasn't difficult room was spacious and quiet. Even though the hotel is located on the main strip because guest rooms are little
40,As many know the south strip resorts can often feel stuffy and very busy at times especially during peak hours. I never felt that way here. Just a nice chill resort. Beds were nicer than any other mgm resort i had been to that i can remember.
50,Had a great stay here. The room had an amazing view of the strip. Was able to walk to a lot of places. Staff was very friendly self check in made it very easy in a packed lounge. The room was spacious and clean. Will definitely be a returning!
50,Nice property. Nice Check in easy. Well layed out. Rooms are nice. The showers are attractive in a dark green tile. But the thing I loved the most was the WATER PRESSURE in the shower.However I am older than most visitors and I disliked how low to the floor the bed was.Some rooms should have more elevated beds for older guests who are less mobile.Employees were all great. Joe the bartendr in The Primrose lobby bar was great and offered coffee when I needed it.He ran off and came back with expresso and fresh brew great serviceNo poker room very slowly dealt craps game below average sports book.
50,First time here. I like the location because it close to every thing I want to go. The tram is very convince to my family. I like the restaurant Eatly. There is some issues when I check in but they fix it ASAP. In general i will come back one more time. I wish
50,We love staying at Park MGM. It is close to activities we participate in. It is close to the Airport. Also lot quieter than being in the middle of the Strip. We like to walk and walking from Park MGM to the south of strip is very enjoyable.
50,Park MGM did fantastic job to revive outdated Monte Carlo geo location stayed the same of course but everything inside is brand new with great customer service  great restaurants and bars Mama Rabbit it’s a must  great cocktails and bartenders super entertaining and friendly !!!  Only advice to hotels is to have small coffee machines in the room which will make already spacious great room I stayed just Fantastic !  Shower is very powerful and modern a little couch by the window is super cozy and it’s feels like you got upgraded room for less !!!!  So pamper yourself and stay at Park MGM!!!
40,Not bad.  Hotel changed the name to Park MGM and the room also better than before.  But still simple but good price.  Location is great just next NYNY hotel also easy to go to shops and Bellagio hotel.  Never been pool ( not sure there is a pool or not) but the restaurant on ground floor is really good and many things to eat!  Cheaper rate with clean room condition I will definitely come back.
30,Simple and basic are the best words to describe.    Positives; comfy bed large shower with great water pressure friendly cleaning crew and room service.    Negatives; check in process was horrible many kiosks do not work no staff to assist unknown charges were required above the normal resort fees and no receipt was provide for those mysterious charges.    The room itself was basic no fridge phone didn’t work and the walls are PAPER thin could hear voices sneezes curtains opening and closing walking up and down.    We will likely spend the extra $50 to stay somewhere else next time.
50,Very clean !!  Staff very helpful  Great location on the LV strip  House keeping - very Excellent  I had a great view of the strip from my room.  After a long day of casino hopping and meeting up with friends it was great to head back to my room to rest andrelax just like going home
50,This hotel was amazing! Very friendly staff. The room was very nice. Hotel is in a great location on the strip. The places to eat inside the hotel are second to none. I would recommend this to anyone.
10,Treat their guess terribly will not recommend or return. No accommodation what so ever. And did not provide a pleasant experience. I remember Las Vegas suppose to be the best of the best but park mgm ruined our experience
50,We have spent several Christmases and News Years in Vegas. We love the quote days leading up to NYE.    This trip we stayed at the MGM Park. We had a Nighthawk Suite which was perfect. We love the room location next to the elevators. The room is spacious and well appointed with two sofas two televisions and a comfy king size bed. The bathroom is bright and roomy. Hot water was never a problem.    We will be back in 2020.
50,Great service throughout the casino and restaurants. Also I became an M Life Rewards member during my stay which was nice. The location is ideal for those looking for a more low-key trip with everyone seeming to be more relaxed.
10,Not the best experience. The initial disappointment with the bell desk ruined my stay. I was looking forward to my Christmas break to get a break from work however i am beyond disappointed . The front desk staff was neither courteous nor friendly or accomodating. No empathy shown when i told him my terrible experience waiting at Valet for my luggage to be picked up.
20,check-in service is confussion the front desk staffs is next to nothing. room is super simple may be due to the low cost. House keeping servvice is slow we waited almost for 2 hours before someone came to redo the cleaning after we checked in.
50,Great location on the strip we were greeted with friendly staff members and a room for the right price would definitely come back and the steak house that is onsite at the casino is definitely worth checking out
10,Charged me extra on room upgrade which I was never agreed to nor was I informed of the amount to be charged in prior! And the hotel insisted I made the upgrade “somewhere” “somehow”. If I was told and informed on the upgrade with extra charge it would be okay. In simple term it’s a fraud! It’s a ripped off.
10,The check in process was simply nonexistent as the app checking does not allow you to check it any faster. He still have to go through all the same steps. The room assigned was dirty and when I called the front desk she spent 1015 minutes on the phone trying to find another room and didn’t even offer for somebody to come and help us with our luggage. When I spoke with her the next day and told her that we were dissatisfied with this kind of approach to treatment she just said sorry and that was it.
50,Had a great time while there weren’t food places open late and slow on service for servers. Great location excellent price and friendly staff. Located near New York New York which was good because they had lots of food places to eat at.
40,Park MGM uses to be the Monte Carlo. MGM did a nice job of renovating the property. The hotel is between New York New York and City Center. Location is good but Bellagio or Caesar's are prime.    This hotel is located right in front of the T-MOBILE Arena so any events there are easy to access but can also be a bit disruptive if you are not attending.    Overall - would stay here again.
20,Staff need to be retrained! Hotel need to be excited when they welcome guest! There restaurants is too expensive!! Rooms are okay to stay by the towels need to be clean they always dirty! When you talk to manager they attack you back with attitude!
10,"From start to finish there were problems with the room and booking. We booked rooms month in advance pre-checked in 24 hours in advance and when we arrived there were no rooms available for us. The substitutions offered were lower level and unacceptable and when a manager was contacted about it they just so happened to ""find"" the rooms available within two minutes which seems convenient and suspicious. There were problems with our room and when we checked out the kiosks weren't working and the lady at the counter checked us out without ever asking how we were or how our experience was. We were never once asked while there how are visit was or we would have told them there. The employees did not seem worried about how our experience was. We always stay at Luxor but decided to try Park MGM and regret it."
50,Stay was awesome. THis hotel looks brand spanking new! With the remodeling and rebranding its excellent. Its very high-end looking and comfortable. Was close enough to get to Michael Jackson One Show at Mandalay Bay. You check-in on screens which is cool. No long wait in line to check-in. I had a great time!
50,Although a new name venue and vibe the staff at Park MGM continues deliver with excellent hospitality. Had a room problem and VIP desk promptly handled our problem with a new room. Staff on casino floor is very welcoming including restaurant bars and clubs. Many good food options to meet any taste. Housekeeping always checking make sure you dont need something. Rooms well appointed and very comfortable especially pillows. Something Park MGM should out on site so people can buy bedding. Centrally located making hard to beat for local access to highways etc. Worth the stay! Cheers
50,We stayed here with some friends to celebrate a birthday. Quick one nigher. Check in was so quick. Self serve tablets with someone to help you if needed. Room was clean comfortable and cool style. Tables took some of our money but we had a good time. Guitarist singer in the bar downstairs was legit!
50,I attended On The Record and had a great time. Instead of the mega dance clubs Park has focused on details and culture. It was refreshing to say the least. Great energy DJ’S and the dance community was out in full effect.
30,Nice rooms. Very clean. Easy to get to Bellagio but very expensive compared to the old Monte Carlo. Drinks were expensive! The perks were not that great. Have been part of Mlife for years and this is a fancier hotel. Not into the fancy so if you are this is for you.
30,The hotel was clean but the walls of the room were so thin you could hear your neighbors conversations. The check in process was on a computer so you lose the customer service interactions. The bed was comfortable but the room was dated. There was no fridge or dresser in the room. We will be staying somewhere else next time.
50,The casino was excellent. I am primarily a slot payer and did quite well in the casino. suites are great. Everyone is so helpful and friendly. My husband ate at La La Noodle and said the food was excellent.
50,The hotel is very modern. The room is small but with all necessary amenities. Everything functions the way they should. Service is also good. No mini fridge. We stayed here using our mlife rewards. 2-night stay.
40,I received this room as a comp. Room was very spacious and comfortable. The housekeeping staff left something to be desired. There was trash left from previous guests and I had to request toiletries after they cleaned. I requested a small refrigerator for my insulin storage but the never brought it which is not good. I had to use ice bucket.
50,It was our first time staying here. we picked this place because my daughter attended an Ariana Grande concert at MGM Grand and this was cheaper than staying there. The room was mostly clean. the beds are amazing!!! nice and quiet and spacious enough for the 4 of us. we will definitely stay again
50,Had a great time the staff was great food with great love the new restaurants Love The Nightlife attraction all in all had a great time would love to come back also would recommend to family and friends
10,Front desk staff had little to no knowledge of their own software or charges or anything. Housekeeping barely stocked toiletries never ever provided us with clean glasses and never cleaned anything other than making the bed
50,First time we stay it was two years even with remodeling it pretty good stay there. This time with everything finish it was nicer it was more enjoyable and fun atmosphere. Will definitely stay at same place next year.
30,Was ok family likes it here so maybe I will be back ... the placement of the hotel on the strip is good. We ate out at a differently place  the slot machines were good  I did enjoy that . I’m sure I will see this place again
20,Room smelled of sewage. We were only there for a short time so was it worth the hassle to change rooms when we would not be in there so much? However it sucked waking up to a stinky room. They came and sprayed to help with the smell. Would not stay there again.
50,Great location for families who wants to cook breakfast also location is central and its a covered walking area to the Boulevard. Restaurants and coffee shops open until late also parking available pool area is excellent.
30,The kiosk check in was the first time I had experienced not having a human to speak with during check in. If you had any questions you were out of luck. We stepped into our room and was greetedd with warmth. After turning the thermostat down the air worked better but never cooled to our liking. I thought it was just us until we spoke with others staying there.
50,"Stayed here for a few nights to end our November trip. Check in is ""modern"" - you check in at a kiosk and get your room and keys assigned (there is human assistance if you need it!). We had a room ready right away so up we went. They did a really nice job of giving the Monte Carlo a facelift. Everything feels new. They went with a darker color scheme so the halls and rooms can be on the dark side but I like that. The room itself is clean spacious and comfortable - great beds and easy sleeping! We had no noise issues at all. Bathrooms are also renovated and look great. There are plenty of onsite restaurants though we didn't try any of them this trip. The casino leaves a little to be desired - I don't know if it's the flow or the machine selection...just never got into the groove here...but there are plenty of other options in town. Lots to see and do in walking distance - I'm sure we will be back here again!"
10,Central air is loud and temperature doesn’t adjust to thermostat ambient setting. Badly insulted rooms I could hear the neighbors talking and plumbing noises as well stayed on the 24 floor hand soap was also missing I the room all in all horrible experience
50,The hotel staff alway treat us wonderful the beds and rooms are new very comfortable beds. Very good restaurants. The pool area is beautiful and fun in the summer. The t-mobile park has great food and beautiful lighting at night.
50,My girlfriend and I had an amazing stay at Park MGM for halloween! We checked in quickly at the kiosk and got our room keys immediately. Our room was cute it had modern art on the walls and a large walk-in shower.  We had an amazing dinner at Nomad Bar with some good drinks. We then went to the club On The Record with some good friends. Our host Carmen was great and got us a nice table outside by the bus bar! After the club we grabbed pizza at Eatly it was the perfect hotel and the perfect night!  Thank you Park MGM and On The Record! Hope to be back soon!
40,This was a nice place to stay overall. My only issues were with the check in system (could not locate my reservation initially) room size and missing toiletries in bathroom. I would stay again but would spring extra $ for a larger suite.
30,Drink girls at casino are very rude and ignored me and my friends and family numerous times while we were in the casino. Almost to the point where it seemed like she was refusing to serve us. We ended up purchasing drinks from bars while gambling and have to keep getting up to go to the bar for a drink. Then our seats at the tables would get taken and we would have to wait to gamble again. Very irritating experience  Everything else was great
10,My entire experience was just horrible bad bad bad bad bad that's good but bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad I hope that you people can improve and the areas that I addressed earlier with you that is being upfront when someone Checks In making sure your cleaning people do what they're supposed to do and let the cocktail waitress B more courteous instead of trying to act like they're in charge ones money
50,Mama Rabbit Mezcal & Tequila bar is beautiful. Eataly is a great addition. The rooms are well done. It is a real upgrade from Monte Carlo. Close to T Mobile and the walk in the park is really nice. Hot tub was open even in 40 degree temps
30,"Pretty mediocre. The check-in process was pretty silly in my opinion. You check-in via tablets in the lobby. Sounds like a great idea but everyone seemed to have a problem using them and there was only 1 employee to go around helping them. Any time I walked through the lobby during my stay it was a madhouse with people trying to check in and not enough staff to help them. Rooms were pretty bleh we actually paid for a ""strip view room"" and you basically see none of the strip besides the coca cola bottle and the bridge/walkway. The A/C was terrible. It would go on shut off etc. Bathroom ""door"" was a sliding barn style door. It was fine for me because I was by myself but there was no way to lock it from sliding. No fan in the bathroom either. Beds were comfy. Very soft mattress's but for me it was OK. Comfy pillows. Lots of good food nearby as well. I wouldn't stay here again because of the usual price they charge being quite similar to better hotels (Mirage Flamingo) but if you got a good deal here then it's maybe worth it. Doesn't really seem like it was renovated at all either besides new signs. Hallways pretty dark and dive looking."
50,Great hotel I won’t stay again as they don’t have a fridge in the room and no microwave. Ice buckets are very small and need to make too many trips to get ice for cold water. Staff is great and friendly
40,The room was really hot. It seems like the AC would work for a few hours then completely shut off I'm the middle of the night. I would try and turn it back on but it just would not start. I was looking for someone so I could tell them but I didn't want to miss my flight.
50,I read on reviews about negative feedback but was surprised how positive my stay was at park mgm. Great layout of the hotel  loved the monorail to Bellagio and the room was cozy. Great location of the hotel itself. Close to New York New York and major hotels. Easy to get to Bellagio and Paris. Not too far .
30,This hotel room itself was small but overlooked the strip (South End near the Excalibur). Hallways are dark but the lobby is nice and the restaurants on site are delicious! There's a free train to get to other hotels just ask the front desk! I liked that it was much less expensive than other hotels and had the Park Theater on the casino level (saw Lady Gaga!)
30,I think this place might have been the old Monte Carlo. Anyhow we saw a Jason Aldean concert here and played the slots some as well. Ok service but again it can get crowded. We need to go back again to get a better feel for it. Laid out very long like...Casino sort of upstairs like on 2nd 3rd floors and such. Slots were ok to us. Didnt hit the tables but a lot of people were.
50,I had a fabulous stay at park mgm. I had 2 comped nights and said “why not?” Definitely do not regret it!!! Beautiful renovated hotel. I loved the 1920’s Art Deco/European vibe. Casino didn’t smell like smoke rooms were spacious and clean restaurants were fabulous!!! Can’t wait to return
30,Room was clean great location friendly staff comfortable beds but the room was very hot even with thermostat adjusted all the way down. I would recommend this room if you aren’t a person that likes to stay cool.
40,Room had urine smell covered up by housekeeping. Second day closer had to be closed due to strong odor. VIP services made arrangements. Gave us resort credit to make up for it. Offered us to change rooms but checked out instead.
20,This hotel is not an improvement. Music everywhere in and around the casino area is too loud. Rooms are a minimalist joke. One 24” table and that’s it. There is a stupid 4” wide “shelf unit” under the TV that is an insult to the guest. There are no dressers and the closet is a literal hole in the wall with a tiny chest of drawers and no room to hang your clothes with the few hangers you get.  The bathroom is nice.
50,Always stay here when I'm in Vegas. Great location and overall hotel. They've done a really good job with the upkeep of the hotel and all the restaurants are great too. Location is great as well if you're watching a Knights game at T-Mobile
50,Very pleased with the new 'Park MGM' renovations. Great choice of restaurants and rooms with lots of character and comfort. Casino floor had a good mixture of tables and slot machines and lots of foot traffic due to the arena next door.
50,My wife and I had a wonderful stay at the Park MGM Las Vegas We had a beautiful suite very clean the bed was very comfortable for a great night sleep. The casino had many new slots we enjoyed our stay.  Thank you Staff and Management of the Park MGM Las Vegas
10,This may be my first one-star review ever. I’m well prone to award stars for at least trying or for the positives I can find in an overall bad situation but this just shouldn’t have happened.    I arrived for a two-day stay after having spent four nights at Vdara (I know always do the luxury property last!) and was welcomed by a friendly helpful clerk. I went to my room and it was about what I expected (Park MGM is one of MGM’s lower-level properties and the regular rooms are built to be utilitarian - the shower and the mattress were nice though). However there were two issues with the room that to me needed to be remedied:    The overall cleanliness was lacking. Crevices had significant dirt and the sofa had unvacuumed grime and bits of food under the cushions. Mind you the hotel does its staff no favors by using furniture and fixtures that were prone to collect dust or spots but a little extra vacuuming and wiping would fix the issues.  The bathroom/closet sliding door (dual purpose!) made a banging noise not unlike a gunshot when opened or closed. That’s not a recipe for making a quiet bathroom visit while a friend is trying to sleep.    I did the expected thing which was to call the front desk and ask if these issues can be remedied or I can make a room change. The front desk staff seemed very intent on keeping me in that room assuring me that they’d send housekeeping and maintenance right up. That would be great.    A half hour later I called down to make sure that the staff would still come in and fix these items while I was gone. I was assured they would and because it was a different staff member she confirmed that the requests were in.    I got back late that night - nothing was fixed and there was no communication to suggest there was any attempt to do so.    The next day I walked up to the front desk and asked the clerk again if either the issue could be fixed or if I could move. She said that she would put in the request again and that she would also comp me one room night for my trouble. (All of the staff that I worked directly with were extremely nice.)    Long story short: I return late the second night and nothing had been done.    And after I received my checkout folio (via email) I was charged for both nights.    Were these things the end of the world? Absolutely not. Is there a problem when people tell you repeatedly that your concerns are being addressed yet they never are? Absolutely yes.    One star. Will not stay there again.
50,Great Location and value. Besure to have your reservation # because there is no front desk. Check in is automated so probably not your place if you're not tech savvy. Overall location makes it a great place.
30,Water pressure awful in shower. Broken plugs. Colors are brutal. Very dark inside. Not enough casual food options. Check in easy. Check out easy. Well located across from the T-Mobile arena. It’s a good location but the look of the rooms leaves a lot to be desired.
30,Staff Friendliness: Non existence at this location I had to chase down a staff member through the casino floor with my 7 year old son to ask were to catch an lyft car and then the staff member acted like I was disturbing them. I'm sorry staff member but yes you have to come to work for at least 8 hours and work too! Be Professional!
30,This hotel has your basics needed but the bathroom could definitely use a shelf or cabinet for putting toiletries and towels. There is also nowhere to unpack any clothes: no dresser so you need to live out of your suitcase during your stay. The gambling here is fun and they have a Starbucks on-site and a CVS within steps great location!!!
50,We stayed here because we went to two events at the T-Mobile Arena. It was right across the street so we were very satisfied with our stay. Also has great food available on the property at Eatly and The Crack Shack!
40,Hotel was clean rooms very comfortable real blackout shades. Casino was clean staff very friendly. Overall the casino/hotel was a very nice place to stay. Don't stay in the room much but did sleep well and was pretty quiet.
40,Not a bad place. Just remodeled. Close to T-Mobile. Table dealers are super nice. Some staff is alright had a couple people huff and puff from me not tipping them. (Tip wasnt even necessary) check in process is on a mobile device you get like a 50/50 chance if it works or not. Going to a human to check in is way easier and quicker. Restaurants are insanely good though. Good luck trying to find a bad one inside this place. Itll be super hard.
50,"We stayed here for a few nights. Our room was nice and clean. We had a king size bed which was comfy. We had a ""view of the strip"" which did was a view of the strip but it was also a view of the roof. Not sure if we paid extra for that but if we did that was probably not worth it. We could hear noise from outside the one night not sure if it was coming from the strip or another room but we didn't hear that the second night. The rest of the hotel was nice. We ate at Eataly twice enjoyed the food. My only real complaint is that you can smoke in the casino. We didn't run across a casino you couldn't smoke it but as a non-smoker it was annoying and unexpected. At least the rooms didn't smell! One more thing was it was disappointing that the rooms didn't have little refrigerators in them. I knew that going in but still it was weird."
20,Many problems from check in to check out. Account not credited with breakfast. Husband held hostage in restaurant while I went to front desk to straighten it out. Casino dark. Suite not what expected. Not worth the money.
50,Spent Step sons 21st birthday here. It was a great improvement from the Monte Carlo which I did like previously. Great job MGM. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone rates are reasonable new age check in.
50,SO The booking rate was like $77.. There was of course an additional180 in resort charges and room fees that have me wondering how much I paid up front and if I got bate and switched.. hold on I better go check that out... I will but even if it was an 3xtra 40 a night in the end it really was not bad in comparison to some of the Seriously overpriced sweets within walking distance. This has a great coupl eplaces to eat. Eataly is a great place to get some meats cheese and whiskey all day and the hotel staff was way cool. Bed was a bit on the soft side. Not my favorite I prefer a bitt firmer.. I would stay there again for that rate anytime
40,We hadn't been to Las Vegas in 30 years and decided to fly out over Thanksgiving to see the Aerosmith concert. I chose this hotel because the concert was at the Park MGM Theatre and figured it would be convenient especially if the weather was bad the night of the concert. Check-in was very convenient if somewhat impersonal because I was able to check in in the taxi on the way to the hotel via my phone and then just get my room key through a kiosk in the lobby at arrival. After checking in and putting our bags in the room we went out to explore. Since the Park MGM is way down on one end of the street where everything is located we used the monorail system that leaves from the nearby MGM Hotel to access the areas we wanted to see that were further on down especially when the weather was bad. We realized after visiting some of the other hotels that the Park MGM didn't have much to offer as far as where to eat or shops as some of the other hotels. We did have drinks and desserts at the Primrose which was nice and we had supper one night at Eataly. But otherwise we had to venture out other places to eat. We're not gamblers so we didn't care about the casino. When we'd catch an Uber to go somewhere else like Fremont Street the staff outside the hotel was very friendly and welcoming. The room itself was pretty standard... nothing to complain about but nothing really that stood out as great about it either...
30,Great location the floor park outside the hotel is a great selection and delicious food. The rooms were kind of smelly while the hallways to the rooms were dark and creepy. I traveled with my daughter and realized I never ever saw any security patrolling the property. Inside the hotel is lacking food options.... but a quick walk the the food parkway outside is a short walk.
50,we had no problem checking in we found the system very user friendly. Finding our way around the casino was not a problem either. . . always someone to help you find what you are looking for doing. The tunnel to connect to Aria and the sky tram makes it easy to get anywhere ! !
50,Park MGM really cares about their guests. We had a problem & they fixed it right away. Very convenient area. Nice casino. The restaurants were amazing we loved the noodle place in the casino. Definitely considering for our future trips!
30,This is a nice hotel but very bland. A/C in our room quit cooling the night we arrived. Called maintenance and was never fixed. Never received an acknowledgement from any staff member about getting it repaired or moved to a different room.
10,Our company reserved the karaoke room and also a travel at on the record. The table they gave us was not big enough and they decide to not honor our karaoke reservation due to a golden knight wanting to last minute book the facility.
50,attended a conference and choose to stay at The Park. Two years ago I stayed after the same location when it was the Monte Carlo. They have made vast improvements with this location. The Eataly upscale foodcourt is amazing. The hotel room was clean and week decorated. I stayed here 6 nights and had a great experience. Check in went smoothly contrary to other reviewers there are people to assist with check in. I will return to The Park
10,When I checked into the hotel they gave me the wrong room. I ordered online a king sized bed and received 2 queen sized beds. When I called they said there was a mix up in my room booking but they had no more rooms. They said I can check out next day and get the kind sized bed room. So I did they charged me double $100 fees and charged me $50 extra dollars each night instead of for just one room $50
40,I liked the location of the park I loved the casino they have an excellent gathering of a restaurant/bar that were so handy to have a right in the casino. My complaint is the room without one drawer and only a chest a small chest to hang your belongings. It is a room for a single person not a couple
40,This is a great hotel on the strip. I have stayed here before it was renovated and the rooms are still a nice size clean comfortable and tastefully decorated. The staff are friendly and very helpful. the only bad thing is the upgrade has led to an electronic check-in hated it as very impersonal and not what you expect from a hotel of this statue. I did make a complaint and management were quick to resolve my problem. Would stay again as location and price are great!
50,The service is great everyone is friendly and the food is perfect everyone really try their best for everyone the rooms are very clean the checkin and checkout experience is very fast and without problems
40,The beds were great! But the casino was horribly smokey!! Very very Bad ventilation. You walk in from a different part of the hotel and it was like something was on fire smokey. Other than that it was a great stay.
40,This was a great hotel quiet and clean. Didn’t seem as packed as some hotel’s and seemed more boutique which I loved. Didn’t seem like a regular casino driven hotel which I like and was much more smaller and simple so it felt quaint. I would stay here again!
40,Only 2 nights  but very well spent !  I mostly used the Casino and was pleasantly surprised at the variety.  I checked out the pool and it looks fun!  Went to eat at Primrose and absolutely love it ! The staff was friendly and helpful.this hotel has a great location and was very easy to navigate. The process of checking in and out is easy convenient and fast .  I will stay here again .
30,The location is fantastic and the free tram makes getting around the strip a breeze. The price was great - cheaper than surrounding properties.    But the room was dirty with several visible stains bedsheets and towels that felt dirty and scratchy instead of soft the window had several visible stains on it.    The walls are so thin that you will hear everything (!) that happens next door. It isnt an exaggeration to say that you will hear your neighbors conversation as if they were standing right beside you you will know what they watch on tv you will hear when they argue or have sex. It was rough.    My room's heater was broken and I was told they would send someone to look at it but the problem persisted.    The location and value are the draws here and the new Eately center is cool and the food was good.
10,This place is rediculous. Worst place for the money on the strip that I've stayed at. They basically only offer Italian food which is good if you only eat once. I stayed for 2 nights so I had to travel to eat elsewhere. Also the resort fees and overnight parking fees are just getting more and more ridiculous. 35 for the resort plus 4.50 for resort fee tax so 39.50 each night plus parking fee of 15 a day. The room itself was booked on Priceline and when I arrived was told since I booked through a 3rd party site I was bumped from a king room to an accessible king room which I didnt want at all. The mattress and pillows were not comfortable. Room and hotel were clean. No one is around at check in or to point you in any sort of direction. You use a computer for check in and check out and never see any staff. You literally have to seek them out if you have a problem with these processes.
50,First visit of many. Last minute stay because of poorly selected air bnb The check in is ultra smooth n simple. I would prefer a larger room but the amenities were perfect. The cleanliness n updates exceptional
50,Stayed at the older version many times. They kept all the good features and significantly improved on everything else. The Casino layout was efficient roomy and comfortable. The Starbucks was constantly busy and they did a great job of accommodating everyone.
40,Great location especially for going to a Knights game. Dining in Primrose for breakfast was amazing the pancakes are unreal. The staff/service was very friendly and attentive. Clean spacious rooms.
50,I love the resort myroom was very clean love the art .the staff and the food here. Very friendly and professional. This was our 2nd visit and had more fun on this trip than the last one. So much to do and see. Will definitely be back.
50,Weekend visit to Las Vegas to enjoy some great dining experience and play slot machines - great room food service from the staff and great location to many activities in the area. Would recommend to friends & family (already have).
40,While the newly renovated rooms are nice customer engagement/service is non-existent. Automated check-in is so impersonal and there was no interaction with any agents. Where is the Management in this hotel?
10,MGM has one of the most ridiculous policies I’ve ever come across! I was scheduled to check out 12/13 at 11:00am but due to an emergency I have to take the midnight flight home so 12/12 at 10:00pm I called them to let them know I needed to check out then instead of in the morning as a curtesy to the hotel. With no explanation of a fee for early check out (which makes no sense) I was charged $157!!! How does that even make sense. I’d get it if it was something that causes a major inconvenience to the hotel leaving the hotel early when it’s already paid for and being charged MORE than what the room even costs makes no sense. I called and they did say they will refund it but my negative review is based off of the fact that a policy like this even exists! This is the last time I will ever stay at an MGM resort.
10,Terrible and aweful the service sucked they lied about the hidden fees we complained about air conditioning and the phone did not work and nothing was done about it I will never again stay there you can count on that
50,I had a great time while staying here. It has a modern touch to everything. I loved being able to use my mgm app for checkin and checkout. Also the fast casual style of many of the restaurants and bars is optimal.
40,Park MGM is the center of many attractions on the strip such as the T mobile arena Coca Cola Store and the actual MGM. If you have a minimalism makes your comfortable at home then the rooms here will accomodate you. Each room provides you with everything you need. Nothing too extravagant nor nothing to underwhelming. Just the right feel for a steady vibe.
10,It started with a poor check in experience & no Help with Luggage and topped off with so SOFT a Mattress that my back ached each morning. The EItaly food court left a lot to be desired. ALways needing to go to a bar for ice even though the drink was bought at a food stand!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
50,This is the old Monte Carlo. I have stayed her for years. This is the second time since their remodel. The property is all about location. The food area of The Eataly is a vast improvement over the past Mexican restaurant that occupied a portion of the footprint. Nice place nice area nice offerings. Resort fee at $37/day is high Room tax $15.79/day Resort fee tax $4.95 per day all on a $118/night room. The fees and taxes are simply the new way the world operates. This is a nice property.
40,The hotel complex and rooms have been recently updated and it shows. Everything is generally clean and kept up. The room felt new and everything was modern. Loved the big screen TV. The room does NOT have a desk if you are trying you do some work. Instead it has an oval table that you have to slide over to the wall to get access to a plug for a laptop. Bathroom has a very nice and roomy walk-in shower (no tub). Room does NOT contain a coffee maker which we were told by front desk is not typical for the big strip hotels. So get ready to take the elevator down to the lobby in your PJs to buy coffee. The hotel uses self-check-in at a kiosk instead of the typical method of standing in line and talking to a person. Some people are put off by this but I did appreciate not having to wait in a long line. Also they have people ready to help you quickly if you are having trouble at the kiosk. Overall we were very happy with the customer service in every case where we needed something. We also really like the overall location of the hotel. It's very close to lots of attractions on foot or by using the tram. The hotel has a good choice of food especially the very popular Italian food marketplace they feature right in front. I would chose Park MGM again on a future trip based on our positive experience here.
50,My stay was great. The staff room casino and food was excellent. I really liked the easy check in and check out. I was there for a business conference the location was ideal. The walk to the Aria was a breeze!
20,We went with another couple and stayed at Park MGM.  Neither one of us will be back. There is only one breakfast restaurant and they charge way too much for their meals! The shops do not have any affordable gifts! 🤬
30,I just stayed here one night for a work trip after my room at Mandalay Bay was oversold. I found the property to be generally average. The rooms were clean and updated but basic. The pillows were terrible I had to wrap a throw pillow in a pillowcase in order to stop my neck from a 12 inch elevation. Walls were thin I could hear people next door very easily. I did have some good dealers at the casino and I like that Eataly is part of the complex. The gym is also pretty nice with a fair amount of equipment. Location is pretty good. Too cold for the pools so couldn't check that out!
50,Good time at Park MGM. Nice clean rooms. Nice casino. Nice theater. Above average staff from bell desk to maintenance to dealers and pit bosses. Only drawback would be pool area. Limited sun time prime chairs are reserved.
20,My bed had extremely nasty yellow stain that took 4 attempts throughout the day. After calling they said it would be taken care of in 5 mins but no one showed up. Eventually i spoke w/ the manager at 2 am who absolutely gave ZERO- F about the situation & my experience. It took an additional hour for someone to come and replace the sheets.
50,Great hotel easy check-in/check-out horrible prices for water in their lobby store. Good eating places close by such as California Pizza Kitchen LaLa Noodles and MGM Grand is close by too for Emiril's place and Wolfgang's place too.
50,The stay well rooms are worth the upgrade. I rested so much better because of the featured this room offers. The air purifier was much needed after all of the smoke you encounter in Vegas...the lighting in the bathroom was amazing for putting make up on.
50,Received exemplary customer service regardless of the department. The best property to stay at on the Vegas strip. Already booked my next stay for 2020. Cannot wait time return. Must eat at best friend delicious food.
40,The VIP High roller slot and Black Jack Dealers and help was awesome. The Rooms were great and we were able to play all day and night by winning a little and losing a little they were very Liberal Machines. The Hotel was Great the Restaurants are fine just not all we would like but for the most part good.
40,Park MGM is very conveniet to all sorts of food and entertainment. Nice staff clean hotel. My complaint is these beds are uncomfortable and the walls are very thin. We where actually woking up one morning by talking and a crying kid next door. Not for me again but a very conveniet place to most everything.
30,PROS:  Room was clean and the bed was comfortable.  Good value for the price.'    Cons:  Hotel uses check in machines; I prefer to deal with a person.  Hotel is located at the far south end of the strip which means you will tend to put a lot of walking miles in. Made my Apple Watch happy my feet not so much.  Lobby restaurant opens at 7am which means I had to go elsewhere for breakfast.  No poker room in the casino.
10,Horrible customer service:  1) no help checking in  2) room was not cleaned so we had to wait for a key to a new room  3) housekeeping did not make up our room when we asked for it to be made up the response was “oh you want the room cleaned?” Is that not what we pay a resort fee for?  4) spa charged our credit card for our pedicure service 4 times and it is still not fixed.  5) when we asked for a manager we could not get one until today two days after check out.    I would never recommend this hotel and will be following up with reviews on every social media site I can find!
30,This was our first time staying at the Park MGM. The new Italian Eatery is excellent as well as The Park theater. We liked the ease of the kiosk check-in but it took away from the personal touches of a traditional arrival. There were not many hotel lobby employees present to ask questions. The rooms are very average. The traditional rooms are a no-frills room so you are paying higher than normal prices for location.
40,We traveled with our three teenagers to see the NFR. The hotel was in a great location as we also caught the George Strait concert at the TMobile Arena which is right across the street. Food options in the hotel were not great for kids but Tom's Urban and the Crack Shack were very close in proximity. The rooms were clean and comfortable. It is apparent this is an old hotel as the ceilings in the hallways are very low and the hallways are very dark but other than that the stay was comfortable and the staff was extremely gracious. Would stay there again.
30,Faint moldy smell in carpet near the foot of the bed indicative of mold. I was there for business and too busy to mention to staff or to bother switching rooms. I just stayed away from that part of the room. Other than that my stay was pleasant.
20,Maybe we are biased because we usually stay at Palazzo or Aria. We were quite disappointed. Elevators d hallways had dirty carpet. Rooms were kind of a joke. Minimalist to say the least. No fridge no coffee maker...pretty basic really. Kind of like staying at a Hilton Garden Inn. We won't be back.
40,I have stayed at this hotel many times in the past when it was the former name. The rooms are better the restaurants are better and the casino is better. They just don’t have a lot of room but not every casino needs to be massive.
50,"It was a truly wonderful and fantastic experience staying at the Park MGM. My family and I always vacation and celebrate Thanksgiving in Vegas where we usually stay for about 9 nights. For the last 14 years we've stayed at the MGM Grand but this year we decided to be adventurous and try something new. We are ever so glad we picked Park MGM! After this experience we agreed to forget MGM Grand altogether because The Park has earned our love in becoming our new ""home away from home."" Anything MGM Grand does The Park does 110X better.    Our room (Queen Room) was huge spacious neat comfortable and clean. I love what they did with the room and decor. They got rid of the clutter of unnecessary furniture. There is a big flat screen TV mounted to the wall. My favorite little space saver was the cute red sofa that ran the length of the window. It was a perfect place to lounge after a long day at the casino. The bathroom was spacious as well especially the shower! I'm so glad they got rid of those ugly bath tubs (I mean who uses those anymore?!) and just made the walk-in shower bigger. Everything was very clean.    The check-in/ check-out process was simple and quick. The Park has self check-in and check-out kiosks which replaces the reception desks. I think this is a very innovative idea and certainly the wave of the future (so get used to it!). The process is easy (just follow the instructions on the screen) but if you need help there are associates that can assist with your check-in or check-out process as needed. They are very efficient professional polite and helpful people. And the best part about all this is that the rooms they give you are on a first come first serve basis and generated by the computer. I think this is a very fair (and unbiased) way to assign rooms to guests. I applaud The Park for this!!    Housekeeping was very responsible and accommodated our needs. The bell desk staff were very respectful and courteous. We were very happy that all the staff we came across at The Park were friendly and polite.    The Park really needs a Buffet. At the time of writing they do not. But I hope in the future they will open one. Everything about The Park was perfect. If I had to make one small gripe it would be that Eataly is WAY overpriced!! It's not that we can't afford it it's more like the prices are not practical for that type of food (and I know I'm not wrong because just about every time I pass by it it's fairly empty).    I would definitely recommend this hotel!!"
50,Have stayed a couple of time under different name. The refresh of the property is awesome. Loved Eatily. And the room. Nice dealers lots of slots. Small for a strip property but I like it that way...
40,Everything was really great! Room was very clean and this is of the utmost importance to me. The staff was friendly and the location of the hotel is the best on the strip in my opinion. If you are headed to Vegas for anything at T-mobile Arena this is the premiere place to stay. So easy. So clean! If you are a coffee person bring your own maker/keurig if possible this was the only trouble in paradise. The Starbucks is overwhelmed in the morning and takes a good while. I like my coffee quick and hot and first thing in the morning. All in all a great place and worth the bucks!
30,Check-in’s are kiosk and non-personal. This is the very first thing that annoyed me from the beginning. Room is relatively small compared to other locations at this price but are clean and comfortable. There are no refrigerators in the room and hallways and elevators are outdated.
50,Amazing! Great location Great service comfortable beds! Great food I would stay here again  very plain comfortable and clean!! First time staying here and not our last! Great concert venue great everything!
20,The customer service was super bad. You should probably consider living at MGM Grand Aria or Mirage instead. It was just a very bad experience overall which made the entire stay very stress full and bad.
20,We stayed at the Park MGM Nomad last night for the Jason Aldean Concert. The check in online was convenient and the mobile checkin kiosk were nice other than ours did not work. A representative took care of it right away and gave us our keys. When we arrived the room there was a nasty-gross ball of hair in the shower drain. We called the front desk and left the room so housekeeping could clean it. When we got back three hours later the glob of hair was in front of our door outside the room. We went to the front desk spoke to a manager and was assured it would be taken care of. When we returned several hours later from the concert the globe of hair was about 2 feet from where it was more in the hallway but in front of our room. At this point we took the hair ball to the front desk and asked to speak to our second manager of the evening. Plain and simple nasty. We did not sleep the entire night wondering how the rest of the “stay well” room was cleaned. Based on the web sight we thought the entire hotel was fully renovated. This was a cheap cost cutting remodel that utilized old furniture and fixtures. Concert was great Park MGM Theatre was an awesome venue. We will never stay at this hotel again and recommend that you don’t either.
40,Spent a week at park mgm . Self check in even though we had to have our passports checked. Room was nice could of done with some draws as only one wardrobe which also had ironing board & case rack in . Housekeeper was excellent clean towels every day room cleaned & bed made.Park mgm is on the strip so good position.Food & drink at hotel was abit pricey but plenty of choice but if you wanted a quick coffee in morning you need to be up early so you don't have to stand in line to long in starbucks.They do sell coffee in other places but not that early. Be aware of the shows most nights lots of people about.All in all a good holiday & would stay at park mgm again.
40,The location is the best for the strip. However the rooms have a shared closet /bathroom door. If you are alone no problem otherwise it's needs to be your best friend or its just wide open living and very small.
50,Great place to stay do business and enjoy Vegas. The staff were more than helpful with check in to accommodations. The bartender from Dublin in the Primrose was amazing - a terrific cocktail and knowledge of Vegas. Berg
30,Could have been so much better. We had AC problems and the front desk didn't seem to care. We had a terrible night's sleep. Room service for the Primrose was very expensive but very underwhelming. They forgot items from our order or just flat out didn't have them but still charged full price. These please other minor issues like a leaky shower lack of refrigerator unless you pay $35 and the sewage smell that was in the lobby are enough to consider not coming back. We likely won't be staying there again.
20,Common areas are great with some cool bars and restaurants. However the rooms are really cheaply done. Just some paint and crooked pictures on the wall. Self check in is really nice and quick. If you’re looking for inexpensive this is it. If you want a nicer experience then I would go elsewhere.
40,We enjoyed our stay at the Park MGM hotel. It is not a flashy as some of the other hotels on the Las Vegas strip. I mean it does not have fountains canals or volcanoes. This hotel does not have a big shopping mall like some of the other hotels.    On checking in I asked if there were any upgrades available. They put us in a room on the 28th floor overlooking Las Vegas Boulevard. The rest of our group were all put on the 9th floor overlooking the pool. They didn't ask for the upgrade.    Our room was large and clean. It even had a sofa right at the window. It was nice that there were three sets of elevators that go to certain floors of the hotel. We had a set of six elevators that bypassed the lower floors. The only negative thing I can say about our room was that the walls were paper thin. We could hear our next door neighbours. Just voices sneezing but no specific conversations.    The casino was nice. I gambled a little bit. There are a few shops in the hotel. There is a restaurant at the hotel as well as a Starbucks. There is also a food court called Eataly in the hotel. In the casino area there is a steakhouse and a noodle bar.  The Park Theatre is also attached to the hotel. We saw Aerosmith there. There is also a tram that connects the Park MGM with the Aria and Bellagio hotels. That tram came in handy for us several times.    There is one thing that guests should know. Inside our room there is a snack tray with overpriced snacks. If any of these items are picked up and not returned within 60 seconds you are charged for this. There is a sign on the tray letting you know but it should be noted in case someone doesn't read the sign.    Overall we had a great experience at the Park MGM. Everything was easy to find check-in and check-out was good. The only real issue is the sound that we can hear coming from our neighbours rooms and that really didn't have a negative effect on our experience there.
50,This was our first stay at this hotel we used it as a few last days of fun after returning from a Europe trip. The highlight of the stay was an on site fried chicken place called the Crack Shack. Hands down best food I've had in Vegas. There is also a tram to the Bellagio and a walkway to Aria. We used the walkway to Aria to grab some late night food and took the tram to Bellagio to check out the hotel and casino. The casino at the park specifically had a great variety of games considering the property size.
20,Loud bass sound most of the night. VERY difficult to sleep. Assume there must have been a dance area somewhere that allowed sound carry to guest rooms. Obviously a major oversight in the design and location.
50,Called MGM for help on deciding what property to stay at for a reasonable price Park MGM was suggested centrally located recently upgraded. She was correct we also enjoyed Little Eataly. Rooms were quiet and comfortable.
30,TLDR Well priced hotel on South Strip with prime location and nice rooms.    The Hotel  The hotel seems to be going for a Central Park theme to match its’ neighbor. It has Eatly Park Theater and is located right next to the T-Mobile arena. It has a prime location for the South Strip along with a tram service. It is well laid out making it easy to get to the strip fast as well having a variety of food and activities. Like all hotels on the strip it has plenty of slot machines along with table games to choose from. The guest elevators are easily located and are in the back of the hotel by the pools. The hotel has good pools that provide the expected amenities. Overall it is a great hotel that is usually priced well that includes prime locations and amenities.  The Room  The rooms are spacious and provide the basic needed amenities. The room follows the color scheme from the hotel and is rather calming. The bed is comfortable and the room has a usable dining table along with a window seating area. It is not a room that stands out in memory but it is a nice room. The bathroom has a larger shower that has good water pressure. The provided counter space in the restroom is a big plus when getting ready in the morning. Overall it is nice spacious room that provides all of what you need but does not stand out.  Negatives  This hotel can get quite noisy depending on the event taking place at T-Mobile arena. When big events are happening it can be quite loud and troublesome to use your car. It becomes a big traffic congestion but is easily walkable. Overall the hotel is great but does not have a true wow factor like other Vegas hotels. This can be a negative to some that are looking for the Vegas wow factor when staying. Lastly the price can fluctuate a lot when big events are on.
20,There was no microwave no refrigerator and no coffee maker in the room. The room smelled of tobacco smoke. The walls were thin so I could hear another guest coughing and puking from the adjoining room. We rented a few movies that were $10 each and they both froze several times throughout the viewing. Parking is an additional $15 dollars a day. Access to the steam room and sauna is an additional $30 a day per guest. If you don't plan on having any left-overs from restaurants that you'd like to save and reheat later if you'd like to go downstairs and wait in line at Starbucks every morning for coffee if you enjoy the smell of smoke and hearing other guests get sick if you like taking 2 hours to watch a movie that is only 1.5 hours long this is the hotel for you. I paid $105 for the room plus $33 for a resort fee plus $15 for parking plus tax per night. That totals $171.47 per night. I personally don't think it was worth it.
50,Our room at Park MGM was an oasis of peace and quiet--no small feat in Las Vegas! We found a convenient selection of restaurants on the main floor. The staff was consistently outgoing and helpful throughout our stay. One of the perks I didn't discover until we arrived was the free tram to several locations along the strip.
30,The staff would not allow my husband to wait up front while I check in. the check in was fast at the kiosk the printing of the key was longer. anyway the staff was calling someone to ticket my husband as he would not leave without me he was being directed to park car and meet me up front.
30,Uninspired with no real significant upgrades. Feels like your saying in Vegas back in 1993. There were multiple signs of water damage throughout the property including a random spraying from a sprinkler over one of the craps tables.
50,I’ve been going to vegas for years and I was a fan of Monte Carlo so I’m glad to see it turn into something as great as the park. The whole family loved it and it’s close to NY/NY arcade. We enjoyed staying on the stay well floor. It was the best experience in a very long time. Thanks for the great service.
40,This is my second time to stay here. The first time a remodel was taking place. It is done and the premise from rooms to casino floor is updated and in excellent condition. The staff was friendly from valet to check in all the way to the casino floor personnel. I would stay here again.
40,Park is an excellent hotel for the money. Is it a 5 star hotel? Absolutely not but it is near the top end of a strong 4 star. You get what you pay for. We always stay there because of the great location. Plenty to see and do. Highly recommended.
50,Park MGM has improved their services and looks. I would not hesitate to stay again. From the checkin housekeeping MLife and restaurant options exceeded my expectations. A much improvement overall from prior experiences.
10,The only good thing about the rooms were the showers. Rooms with good water pressure. Rooms were always hot even though thermostat was set to 60 degrees. Uncomfortable beds no storage (dressers / drawers). Service and price on casino floor was horrible and prices very inconsistent. Two of the people in our group ordered the same exact drink from the same bartender at the same time and were both charged different prices. (Bloody Mary from casino bar. Guest #1 charged $11.98 and guest #2 charged $12.98)
40,Park mgm is pretty much in the middle of the vegas strip. Ive been staying here since the monte carlo days. They did an excellent job renovating especially with the new dining options. We definitely enjoyed our trip!!!
10,What a disappointment. Lobby is ok if you don't mind checking yourself in on a computer. Once you get on the guests floors the carpeting is filthy. Rooms smell. No washcloths you have to use a towel to wash your face. It seems like they have updated an older hotel the exterior and lobby then kept the rooms as they were. Bars and restaurant hours were limited.
40,Very Nice Hotel! Be warned check the Knights Hockey Schedule when booking your rooms! They share the arena parking with the Park MGM parking. It took us almost an hour and half to get into the parking garage because the Knights game was letting out right as we were trying to get back to our room. It is a mess. But other than that the stay was amazing. We always recommend LaLa Noddles. Amazing Food and Drinks!
50,We loved Park MGM this was our first time staying at the hotel and enjoyed the entire experience. The rainy weather prevented us from enjoying the outdoor park area. Eataly is amazing. The pizza and panini's are out of this world and the salted caramel gelato was the best ever! The entire family enjoyed it!
50,Located in the center of it all. Very convenient and with many dining options. Especially Best Friend and La La Noodles! I was in Las Vegas to attend a concert at the MGM Garden Arena. It took me less than 15 minutes to get to my seat from my room!
30,Felt like they would of really pushed the wow with the amount of time and money to revamp the old Monte Carlo. You can see physical improvements in the structure but the attentiveness of the employees is not up to par for the money MGM put into the remodel.
40,Great location! Friendly staff. Very clean. I liked that they had a taxi and Uber/Lyft stand as well. Wonderful array of good eats at this hotel. Pay for the upgrades because the regular rooms are really small.
20,no smoking in any rooms... rooms are not that great no mini fridge not much of a view. my room was a mile walk from the elevator restaurants were not that great.... the theater was nice though and easy to get to our seats
40,Location was great and the rooms were reasonably large. Rooms were European style and we would stay again IF there was a microwave and fridge in each room. A coffee maker would be an added benefit. Check-in/out was super easy via phone.
40,Great location easy walk from room to strip good restaurants comfy bed and good service. Could walk over to Aria without going outside and get to tram fairly easily. Uber pick up location nice. Room was a little small and underwhelming with basic amenities but we were only in it to sleep so it worked fine. Check in was easy despite self check in method and someone was there to assist with questions.
50,My family and I love Park MGM! Every time we stay check in is prompt customer service is on point and food is amazing! Every morning there is coffee at Starbucks then anything in the Eataly for lunch and dinner. Park MGM is a destination that is family and dog friendly!
50,I am satisfied with my current stay at Park MGM the casino is nice and clean the staffs service is excellent the beverages service is nice a lot more new slots games more restaurants and Italian food court it's everything in one place.
50,Check in was fast no issues. Checked in with App. We got a room better than what we expected. Wonderful view. Clean room comfy bed!!!! Loved our whole vacation. Location is very convenient . Cant wait until they finish the bridge that us being billed.
40,Property was nice. Casino and hallways to rooms a little dark. Interior colors a little off. Overall was good. Food was good and easy access to Aria property. Good location on strip. Standard rooms a little small but clean. Bed was comfortable.
10,Upon trying to check out I found I was mischarged for valet parking which I did not use. Had to spend additional 30 minutes calling front desk AND valet to fix the problem. Poor customer service from both areas left a terrible memory of what was a fun Vegas trip.
50,loved this hotel for the location and value but the service is also exceptional. Its location is excellent. Walking distance to everything and the tram helped a lot Went to Bellagio through the tram. It's so cool.
10,Terrible hotel room was bad a/c system did not work well!! bad acetone smell on the floor we stayed on and on two other floors was reported and no follow up by the hotel personnel! I would not recommend this hotel to anyone
40,Stayed at the property when it was still the Monte Carlo and was disappointed at how outdated it was. After seeing that it had undergone a complete makeover we decided to give it a try. First impressions was the staff. Very friendly helpful and efficient. Next came the rooms. They are being spacious and well appointed. The beds are very comfortable and if you need anyone the housekeeping staff is quick to respond. The addition of “Eataly” is great. Is is so easy for the whole family to find something to eat or enjoy a nice sit down dinner. Also the Nutella dessert counter and other bakeries will not disappoint! (The crepes are every generous and can easily be shared. )  We took in a Vegas Knights game while we were there. It was a chilly windy day so we could not have been in a better location. Out the main entrance and straight into the T-Mobile Arena.  My only disappointment was the $100 dollar a night fee for my daughter’s 8 pound chihuahua and nearly $40 dollar a night “resort fee” at a time of year when the pool is closed. I thought that was a little steep even by Vegas standards.  But all things considered we would definitely stay here again.
20,very overpriced for what is included. no microwave no refrigerator pillows were very hard. very limited room service food available. the room was cleaned daily to satisfaction. Everything in this hotel is very expensive. All drinks are measured to the drop while charging $18-$20 per drink. We will never stay here again.
20,Thought this hotel would be much nicer. Boy was I disappointed! Rooms were old and dingy. No mini fridge! Terrible dark hallways on room floors. We had a room on the 13th floor - never stayed in a hotel that had a 13th floor (they usually skip). Hallways on all levels smelled like flatulence. The valet was NOT included in the hotel service charge - so that cost an additional $24 on top of the resort fees. Very disappointed. Only redeeming qualities were location and Eataly.
40,Yet another review of mine at a Rock’n’Roll event RocknRoll Las Vegas 2019 Marathon & Half Marathon My 6th str8 each year at a different hotel. This year I chose Park MGM because the $100 rate on the RnR LV website. For value it was good. The location is right in the middle of the strip and easy access to monorail thru the MGM. The hotel remodel is very nice. Housekeeping was very friendly. The race started right outside the hotel and the Fleetwood Mac concert Saturday night was at TMobile arena literally right there right out the driveway. Check-in is a kiosk. I had pre-checked in on my phone but that seems to not have mattered. This all felt very detached and impersonal. The machine printed out a receipt never-mind that it was from the customer there PRIOR to me which I would find out in the elevator when it would not allow me to access the floor. It printed two room keys after the receipt so apparently wait for your receipt after the keys. Then when you know the correct floor you hold your room key on the sensor in the elevator and you can select only your floor. The room was nice the view ok even with it being a strip view it’s not worth extra bucks for a side view of some of the strip. Save your money get your view from the Eiffel tower. I have pictures not anything great woo there’s the Hard Rock and the MGM. I had two rooms but someone couldn’t make it so was down to one room. My friend had his name on the one room we stayed with and even though it was my credit card his name appears on the tv no big deal. I didn’t ask for a refrigerator so if that is something you need ask for it. The race weekend is two races and out on Monday so it goes by in a flash. The star of the room is the great shower and hot water with great water pressure. It was a warm week for November so the AC was on the entire time. Temperature was decent in the room didn’t spend a lot of time there. The casino was ok didn’t feel like they cared if we were hotel guests and had better luck two years in a row at Sahara. Just being honest. I used best parking dot com and for $40 total parked my rental Friday to Monday the entire time. Took the monorail everywhere it was great. Overall I had a great leg massage in the Park MGM Spa and a runners pedicure in their salon the staff was friendly and professional top notch. The hotel was nice and somewhat affordable even though I see the rate is $69 right after the race weekend. That’s how it goes though. I’m on a national team Team Chocolate Milk and my sponsor had delivered a package for me before I arrived Friday Nov 15 I found the voice message on my room phone Sunday night after the half marathon and finally got it  not ideal communication. Here’s pics of the view the room the shower and the race stuff.
40,I went to a Knights/Oilers gameit was a perfect location just steps away from the arena. Good food options in the hotel lobby area. Very nice front desk staff that was very helpful. A tram is located in the back.
50,My frien and I spent the weekend in Vegas to play Texas Hold'em. We choose Park MGM because of the quality of hotel price and location to where we where planning on playing poker. My wife and I stay here whenever we can because of the great value for the rooms. My friend and I were very pleased with everything about Park MGM. We defenitely recommend the property to anyone.
40,My husband has been coming here annually to a meeting for about 10 years and I tag along. The remodel is nice but there is no where to get a quick affordable meal. The Italian themed chain Eataly is nice and lots of options if you want Italian. We are always there in November and the pool/hot tub area closes at 4 pm and the only other option is to pay at least $20.00 more per person (I have not checked this in years) per day for the spa. The room remodel done more than a year ago is nice and very modern and a king room has lots of space. No fridge in room. Not thrilled about the kiosk check in because they always seem to require help......even our help was frustrated and had to keep tapping the same button for it to move.
40,Very nice rooms. Love the central location on the strip. Easy access to most destinations and the casino bar is fun. Brought my son for his 21st and we had a blast. Loved the lady gaga exhibit and eataly was very good.
50,We are always thrilled to stay at Park MGM. I tell people it’s our hidden gem because it’s immaculate room accommodations at a low cost. We love staying here and we love the staff. Thank you for being our home away from home!
50,We've stayed at the Park MGM when it was the Monte Carlo and keep coming back. The staff: has always been helpful and friendly. The rooms: are really comfortable (like the renovations that have been made). The casino: is just the right size - the layout is not too large so it's easy to not get lost. The restaurants - my fave are Crack Shack Lala Noodle and Eataly (especially the street food and nutella crepes!) oh and Starbucks is conveniently located outside the lobby area. Parking is easy - I like that there's usually a parking attendant at the in/out area just in case you have a problem.
50,Great place to stay best location on the strip. Next to TMobile. They have great concerts a lot of slot machines. Great customer service. The perfect time is to go around Thanksgiving. The Christmas decorations are beautiful.
50,Booked location because of concert on site. Was so pleasantly impressed with entire experience. Staff was AMAZING. Clean comfortable rooms and GREAT restaurants. Concert venue was intimate (around 5400 sold out I believe) and location puts you in the heart of it all. Highly recommend.
50,I would like to highlight an exemplary M Life Rep Kim Smith. It is Thanksgiving and I was in line at the M Life desk in the Park MGM awaiting my turn. There were a few people before me. Ms. Smith was helping an M Life member. When she was finished two men approached the counter. One was extremely rude and belligerent. He was cursing at her and threw his I.D. at her. His complaint was was he was a V.I.P. and why did she help the person ahead of him. I was embarrassed as a guest that someone would be so abusive.      Ms. Smith was extremely professional and was attempting to deescalate the interaction. She treated this man with respect and politeness while trying to address his concerns. This man was unrelenting in his abuse. So much so that security was called. He unfortunately stormed away before they could arrive.     Afterwards Ms. Kim needed a moment to collect herself. His actions had made her cry. I was extremely upset at her treatment. When it was my turn I asked if she was okay and if I could speak with a manager. As a witness I wanted to give any assistance I could. One was not available at that time and I had reservations at Bavette's with my dinner party of five in a few minutes. After dinner I felt compelled to follow up with a manager to express her professionalism.    When I arrived at the M Life desk again Ms. Smith was at her post smiling and adeptly helping other members. This time I was able to speak with a manager to share my experience of Ms. Kim and what had occured.     I am acutely aware of the hard work that goes into making my visit as guest as comfortable as possible. My experience especially at the Park MGM has always been extremely welcoming at the M Life counter. This is due to the many people that work tirelessly so we as guests have a memorable experience. Employees such as Ms. Smith are why the Park MGM is my preferred hotel when I visit the Las Vegas area.
10,Too far from strip and hotel too cold. Been to other hotels and much better. Going back in January and made reservations at a different hotel. Store should sell little boxs of cereal and milk. All but snacks
40,Loved the room except for the bathroom. The sink was too small and water did not drain efficiently. Check in was quick and easy. I have the app so that helped. Best Friends is an amazing place to eat.
50,I enjoyed my stay at Park MGM. Easy to check in online. Also was updated and notified when things were going to change. My room was clean and organized. Conditioning was on and the room wasn’t freezing. A mix of older younger crowd. Everyone was friendly. You are right at the end of the strip with much to do. Walk out and you’re there!!!
10,Check in process is terrible. All self service kiosks and they don't work. Fresh coat of paint over old Monte Carlo. With so many other options why stay were they design everything for no guest interaction? When you try to talk to a human there is a huge line because everyone is experiencing problems.
30,We stayed here on our recent first visit to Vegas as we were attending an event at the adjoining theatre and therefore not being clear as to the locality we stayed at the Park MGM out of convenience.    The hotel was okay. We arrived at 3:15pm to find that the automated checking system via iPads in the foyer told us the room was not ready even through I had check in online via the app the previous evening and that check in time was 3:00pm.  A member of staff soon rectified the issue.  We went to the room which was function if dated and pretty drab.    We slept better than expected considering we were probably expecting it to be worse.    We had a room credit for breakfast which we ate at the Primrose on both days which presented a very different level of service on the two visits.
30,A friend and I each redeemed 2 comp nights via PopSlots. Arrived around 5pm and our adjoining rooms were not ready eventhough the hotel knew about the request. We were offered rooms on the 12th floor but wanted a high floor that we were originally booked for. We chose to wait for a 20-something floor room to be cleaned but was given a wait time of 30 minutes to 2 hours. We came back 90 minutes later and the previous staff Arlene had put us in the 12th floor rooms! So we were upgraded to a StayWell room on the 23rd floor.  The rooms were nice the beds were so comfortable. No coffee maker or fridge in the room. When our luggage was brought up the staff told us there is a fee for the fridge unless you tell Housekeeping it's for medication ;-)  The property itself is like an average Vegas hotel. Overpriced food and drinks. Would only stay again on comped nights.
50,We were happy with our stay. Close to all the attractions we wanted to go to. Watery and Primrose have good food and was very satisfied. Casinos were fun. Our room was clean and the bed was comfortable.
50,Great location. Having the Tram to the Bellagio is great.Friendly staff very helpful and always smiling. Walking distance to everything in this area is great. Its a smaller hotel and casino but it is nice and cozy and clean.
40,Great location with easy access to dining options and the arena/theater. Hotel itself was fine. We experienced a few missteps from housekeeping but would recommend it still and stay there again though.
30,Overall the park MGM was pretty good. The rooms were nice and the housekeeping staff were very friendly. The location was very convienient. The only problem we had was the bartenders were very rude and many people complained about it.
20,No actual front desk did not like checking in Via kiosk. The beds looked and felt like something from a second hand store. Absolutely no complimentary coffee anywhere in the building. No coffee machine microwave or fridge in the room. While gambling almost impossible to find a cocktail waitress
20,That’s the only redeeming factor. The rooms feel like a 1960s motel. Terrible table chair window seat set up. There is no good place to do any work. The room was clean however. The casino was so smok filled it was unbearable. The Aria was great Cosmo great MGM great but the MGM Part was terrible. Maybe their air filtration system was broken. The staff in the Primrose bar couldn’t answer the simplest question about the ILA that carry. Over all the worst place I’ve stayed in Las Vegas. I come to town 2-3 times per year.
40,Even though our room wasn’t ready when we got there they rushed it. When we came back in an hour our room had been taken. We got upgraded! Nice clean hotel. However the food is quite pricey so we ate off site.
50,Excellent location on the strip close to everything especially T-Mobile arena! Freshly renovated rooms are very well laid out and nicely appointed. Staff is very friendly and helpfull. Very good value!
40,"We stayed 3 nights for a little relaxation and to catch a hockey game ""GO Knights"". The room was nice clean and comfortable the lobby and casino where a little stinky but what can you do. (when someone finally has the stones to open a smoke free casino in Vegas they will make a killing.) Super close to T Mobile. I like the Eataly and the layout of the casino the place could use more food options especially late but we had a good time and would certainly go back again."
20,Though this is now Park MGM the carpeting in the common areas along with the plumbing in the room seems to have remained the same as it was when it was originally opened as Monte Carlo. When entering the room the entryway (including the ceiling) is painted blood red and this is also the color of the wall that’s opposite the guest room door. Even the window shade is this same blood red color and the shower is aggressively included in the color scheme with blood red subway tiles. In order to flush the toilet in the room the handle had to be held down for 10+ seconds.    The staff at the resort was great and there are some definite positives. The dresser is removed from below the television in guest room which opens the room up and leaves so much more room for activities. There is a floor-length dressing mirror in the room with lights on either side which is fantastic.    The shower head and shower pressure were phenomenal. Placing the rack outside glass shower door that held the towels washcloths and additional sundries was genius. This allowed for grabbing a forgotten washcloth after already jumping in the shower and being soaking wet. Dcefinite high five on the showering experience.
50,Had the room for Thursday night arrived friday morning at 130 am it was ready and waiting (just called the reservation department and let them know I would be in late).    The casino area was full of fun people and the staff was great!    The rooms are always clean and comfortable.    The waitresses were on it while at the table (this doesnt always happen at other places and you are left with wanting a drink. Whether alcohol or not)    Charging to the room at other MGM establishments was easy. As always Great food! And any type of food!!    Try and go about 5 times a year and always worth it!
30,The Park MGM hotel is located in a great spot on the Strip. There was nothing special about the rooms. As a matter of fact the rooms were very generic. The casino was very clean and it was nice having Eataly located in the lobby area.
40,The hotel is just the right size. Not to big but it still has everything you need. Location is great nice area just outside the hotel with shops & restaurants. The rooms were nice clean looks pretty new. No refrigerator in the room.
20,The room was very disappointing. A bit outdated. Would have liked the pool to be more lively but was a bit chilly. Lastly they definitely need a poker room and better signage for their $16 priced waters.
50,We have stayed at the Park through all the renovations. They did an amazing job the whole place looks great! Love the location. excellent food options rooms are nice beds and pillows are comfortable.
50,Our vacation was Sunday through Wednesday a short trip but Park MGM made everything perfect. Kind professional people everywhere. We attended the Aerosmith concert there at the Park MGM Theater and it made it so easy to stay at Park MGM for our entire time there. Food in the Eataly was excellent. Room service was awesome! Walking the strip was also fun and exciting! Loved it!! Will be going back to stay at Park MGM again for sure.
10,Don't waste your money unless you don't care one bit about the room. Bed sucked! No coffee pot refrigerator or micro wave. Safe wouldn't even fit my purse! Shower head I have way way better at home!! Our room was on the 23rd floor the special StayWell room it smelled like cigarette smoke as did the whole lobby and casino..
50,Good hotel and good location clean and comfortable room. Helpful staff. The weather was good. Overall the trip was good. My friends was so impressed with the room and the location. We are planning another trip soon.
50,We were there for my cousins 40th birthday. We watched football games played table games slots and of course the electric ponies. The staff was friendly accommodating and very personable. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay!
10,WORST SECURITY and management unimaginable.    I do not recommend staying here if you care about your privacy personal belonging or just decent guest treatment. If you want strangers to go in your room when you're not there and take ALL of your stuff out of the room this is the place for you.    We checked in on Nov 242019 put our stuff in the room and left the hotel to go out. When we came back at night all of the stuff we previous unpacked was all stuffed into our luggage and the room was cleaned. We were tired and thought it was the house cleaning people. In the following morning we realized that we were actually missing our belonging and notified the hotel.    After a lot of waiting and inquiring at the front desk. We learned from the security & Head of Security Mr. Bradford that while we were gone the guests from the previous night used their keys to enter into our room packed and took all of our stuff out of the hotel room. Later these people came back to the hotel and told the hotel clerks they had taken our stuff by mistake and wanted to return it. The hotel put our stuff back into our room without telling us that any of this has happened.    All of our personal belongings were taken by strangers and the hotel clerks who put our stuff back into our room FAILED to notify us. Park MGM would have said nothing if we didn't filed a missing item report. How shady? Absolutely unacceptable. When I told the manager this she even downplayed the situation and didn't provide us with peace of mind.    The hotel manager/security on duty also did not refresh our room keys or change rooms for us. When we ask what they will do to make sure that this type of situation will not happen again the night Manager on Duty Jacqueline gave us vague non-answers. We also had to go back to our room and call security again to ensure that they will contact us to follow through with the investigation because it's easier to just cover this incident up and not properly address the string of people who led up this horrendous mishap.
50,Nice hotel/ casino. Fast check in. Room was good with extra pillows that were very comfy not a long walk to casino from room. Very friendly staff. Uber / Lyft access was great. Close to front lobby. Would live to have had a coffee pot in the room.
50,Great location. Hotel was great. Loved the Eataly there Room was great. Comfortable bed. Great view of the strip. Got upgraded without even asking. That was a nice surprise. All the staff were so helpful
50,Check in & out was easy room was very clean beds were extremely comfortable decor was pleasurable and not over the top. It was fabulous to stay at the venue of the show we were seeing - no dealing with valet or traffic - just stopped to have a drink and then back to room.
50,Had a great stay at the Park MGM. Breakfast was outstanding at the Primrose and the server was fantastic. Casino is well organized. The Moneyline bar was perfect to watch the college football games. Rooms are excellent and the location of the hotel is perfect.
50,So the Park MGM used to be the Monte Carlo. I usually stayed there because it was less expensive versus other M-Life properties. However since the remodel and transformation I love the Park MGM. It is my go to. And what is cool is that not a lot of people know about it (or so it seems to me). Adding Eataly is a masterstroke. It is just right to fit the vibe of the hotel.
40,The Park Mgm is an excellent value. Perfect location on the block. Close to a ton of restaurants and retail shopping. The monorail is close by. If you are into sports the T-mobile arena is next door. The room size is good and up to date.
50,We had visited Park MGM during an earlier vacation and - looking for a new experience - decided to stay three nights. The casino was clean and only overcrowded after a show at the Park Theater. However we won't complain about that because we were part of the crowd after seeing Aerosmith in concert! Robert Irvin Restaurant was a return dinner plan for us. Convenient location. Yes - we recommend.
40,Remodeled rooms were OK. Wished the room had automatic blinds and bathrobes. Check in experience was very confusing. I had received a message prior to arrival to pre-check in... Seemed useless. Had to do it all over again at the kiosk after arrival. Check-in queue was very long. At 3:45 pm was told my room wasn't ready yet. Kiosk check-in didn't leave me with a good feeling/first impression. If you pay for parking thru room charge don't drop room key when checking out! You'll need it to exit parking garage.
40,This hotel is near everything. walking distance to the the strip. We liked it and the best part was eating at the Eataly it was perfect for us because some of us wanted pizza and the rest of us wanted different food
40,Park MGM was fabulous!! If you are coming out for Rock N Roll Series this is the place to stay..they have food specials for the runners!1 Great food easy access to the Strip Uber location was awesome. Eataly was incredible and if/when I come back to Vegas Park MGM is tops on the list.
50,The hotel is basically on the south end of the strip. There is a tram that runs with multiple stops to the Bellagio. The Park Theater is in the hotel. Which is very convenient. We were there for the Aerosmith residency. Very easy to get to the theater. There are multiple food options through the casino. Catching a ride share is easy. They have a dedicated area for it. There is a Starbucks right off the lobby. It stays busy all day. The service is fast but expect a 10-20 minute wait.
30,Checked in and after about 10 minutes I see a large cockroach dash under the furniture. Called front desk to be relocated. Staff did nothing else but move me to another room. View was worse. Back of hotel
50,The Park MGM is perfect for any age. Walking distance from a CVS just incase you forgot anything on the way there. Easy to navigate many great food options staff is friendly and there is a tram to the Aria Crystal shops and the Bellagio
30,Rooms are very nice and updated..food was good at the steakhouse..I experienced 4 rude staff members while there..Good hotel but the staff use some customer service etiquette. Did not like the fact you have to pay each day to park your vehicle when you are staying there.
20,Renovations have made lobby area and main casino floors etc nicer however did not appear to improve feel of old rooms. Room seemed small compared to 3 other hotels on the strip stayed at this past few months (Bellagio Treasure Island Wynn). Room was very very hot and AC did not seem to have any effect (set at 65). Rooms very loud hearing talking curtains opening and closing and phones ringing in rooms beside. Check-in process was a real frustration with automated machines the only option and only about 20% actually worked even then still required an agent to clear certain screens. Better options around.
50,CynthiaTravelingQueen will definitely come back again this hotel was fabulous Great value and fabulous restaurants and shows I enjoyed my stay and I will be back soon and I would recommend this Hotel to everyone
50,Everything was really nice at the hotel. We stayed because Park MGM is very close to T-Mobile arena (Fleetwood Mac concert). Only thing that happened was that I had a room credit and it wasn’t applied at checkout. I called the front desk and they took care of it. Room service was fast and tasty.
40,Nice clean rooms a little small for business as I was hoping for a desk to use for my laptop. I would also like a fridge in my room for waters and drinks. Great location especially if you are attending a function at the T-Mobile Arena.
50,My Park MGM experience. Was a nice change of pace from the bigger more glitzy places on the strip great food awesome staff great gambling experience sports book was unique with a different set up I will be back very soon!
50,Our family had a great vacation at the Park MGM Las Vegas. The hotel is outstanding and convenient to everything. The room was very nice the staff is very friendly and our family had a great time. We will definitely be staying there again!
10,We stayed at Park MGM for a second time and were very disappointed.    Rooms are too small  Charged for two bottles of water when we only purchased one  A/C not good  Walls too thin and we could hear our neighbors    You get what you pay for
50,Loved this hotel for staying when we came for the Aerosmith concert. So nice to just go to the concert and not have to worry about parking ect. Quiet big rooms. Lots of food choices in the hotel. Only complaint was the breakfast selection for places to eat in the hotel. All the employees were very friendly and attentive.
40,It was a very good stay at the hotel other then the issue with my M card. I hope to get this resolved so that I can come back next year to the same hotel. I found that Eataly was absolutely fantastic.
20,The Park MGM does not feel like a 4 stars hotel. The room's window facing the Strip was very dirty the TV remote did not work and there was no clock or fridge. Food options in the Aria Hotel next door were more appealing. Too smoky although that might be true of all hotels in Las Vegas.
50,The Park MGM is the best. It is by far the best Hotel in its price range. Clean beautiful top notch service great amenities. In addition the property is smaller so its not a hassle to get around the property or head to the strip. I love it.
40,Cute Hotel that has been redone and a fair value for the rooms. I really enjoyed breakfast in the mornings at the place near the hotel check in you really felt as if you were having morning coffee in a park.
30,The hotel: I was here for the 1/2+Full Marathon weekend. This hotel was in great walking proximity to the race start village. Upon arriving the bell staff were fast and super courteous. The problems I experienced with this hotel were mainly in the check-in process. Unlike any other hotel I've stayed at there are small self check-in kiosks you arrive at. At first the kiosk incorrectly stated my room was not ready. Once I figured out how to get assistance a kind lady told me the machines were experiencing some issues and she assigned me a room. Once I arrived at the room however it was the incorrect room type I paid for. I was quickly moved to a Stay Well double queen room which still was incorrect at the end of the day (should have received a solo King) but not a huge deal. I just felt bad the room could have went to someone with a bigger party instead of just me.    Highly recommend getting a Stay Well room if you have the option to. There's a nice air purifier running a room diffuser and the shower has a Vitamin C infused shower head. The lighting was good and the room itself was very clean. Housekeeping did a great job while I was there. I wish the room had a coffee pot/tea kettle. I would have liked to wake up or went to bed with a nice cup. There was also no complimentary bottle of water which would have been greatly appreciated. There is also no minibar/mini-fridge. The beds are supposedly memory foam - but much firmer than I would have liked.    The spa: BEST PART of my stay. I had a phenomenal visit. Shout out to Luke for a fantastic massage. He checked in a few times during the actual treatment to make sure I was ok and I loved the incorporation of sports therapy elements. There are plenty of showers a steam room and sauna. The steam room was quite pleasant.    There is a pool and gym on premises but I did not get to enjoy those this time around.    The area: Closest to the New York New York casino/hotel. There are a few restaurants on-site and do visit Eataly if you have a chance to. Many dining/grab-and-go options. T-Mobile arena is right around the corner of the hotel. Closest monorail stop is located at the MGM Grand which is about a 10-min walk.    Summary:  + More affordable than some other hotels on the strip  + Friendly staff  + Great spa  - No coffee machine/tea kettle  - Resort fee  - Check-in process
30,The only thing good I can say about this hotel is that it is convenient to the T Mobile Centre. Having reserved rooms in July and after several phone calls confirming our reservation for 2 king strip view rooms we arrived at 1 a.m. to find we did not get the rooms we requested. THE ROOM WE HAD THE FIRST NIGHT DID NOT EVEN HAVE A GLASS IN IT SO ONE COULD RINSE THEIR MOUTH AFTER BRUSHING TEETH.There are no clocks coffee makers microwaves bar fridges in rooms. If you pick up any of the items from the mini bar....chips bottled water etc. for more than 60 seconds you are charged. Halls are very long and dark. Beds were uncomfortable. $37.00 per night RESORT FEE which after researching I have found is ILLEGAL. Would not stay there again.
50,This was our second stay at Park MGM Las Vegas ... we love the homey ... apartment like feel of the rooms. But whether it's the Park Theater MGM Grand NY NY or the T-Mobile Arena staying here makes parking a breeze.
10,If you would like to be actually robbed this your hotel! We had our backpack with my wallet in it stole while dining at Eataly. Rooms are small and dirty. The staff and security are just for show. Go anywhere else!!
40,Hotel was very clean overall. Check in is all automated and the machine we when to first was not working properly so it took a bit longer. Rooms are nice but they charge you for snacks when you do not have any. I was charged $18 for in room snacks when we asked about them they said that they could not do anything about it. I should have gone back to the room and taken the two items that I was charged for.
40,My wife and I visited the Park MGM as a getaway for a few days. I was impressed with the kiosk check-in process and assistance available if needed. I appreciate the complimentary early check in and the hotel/resort was nice. I had a nice king room with a great view of the T-Mobile arena. The only thing I didn’t like was that the rooms didn’t have a microwave nor fridge. Nonetheless the hotel and rooms were very clean but don’t touch anything in the minibar area because you’ll be charged if moved for more than 60sec. Yes if anything is moved longer than 60sec you will be automatically charged for the item.
40,After a nightmarish 4 nights at the Harrah’s hotel on my way out of Las Vegas I stayed at the Park MGM. Self-parking is fifteen bucks which is fine. Their resort fee is annoying but I guess it’s standard. As anticipated check-in via the tablets was glitchy but a cheerful staff member checked me in. The room was clean albeit a bit worn (scratches on the table stains on the carpet housekeeping forgot to provide hand soap) and honestly vastly superior to what Harrah’s offered. I was a bit disappointed that their lobby bar closed at 9 pm on a Friday night (in Las Vegas!) but went to the NoMad’s bar for a drink. There was some noise from boisterous guests in the hall but the bed was comfortable and the shower and shower products were outstanding. I would definitely stay here again.
50,I can’t say enough about how great this hotel is! Perfect location with walking access to T Mobile Arena. Safe area of The Strip. Easy check-in and check-out. Super comfy beds clean rooms and power wash shower! Perfect!
20,Save your money and don't believe the hype about the Stay Well rooms. The mattress was rock hard. Pillows were horrible. Special air filtration... No. Special shower /water... No. Lighting fixtures looked ancient. The weirdest part was the pink bordello lighting. The artwork on the walls were very bizarre. Pass. Never again.
40,Great place to stay especially if you're seeing a show at the Park MGM theater or arena next door. Room was SUPER clean and very nice! LOVED the shower!!  Reasonably priced. Restaurants food selections were ok but I wish there was a 24 hour coffee shop type place.
50,We love the location and size of this hotel. It has the feel of the LAs Vegas strip without being too large. Eataly is a fabulous and affordable restaurant with lots of great options. The rooms are very large and comfortable. One of our top choices to stay when we come to Las Vegas
10,Such a difficult check in system. Had to wait for a human to help and they still had problems. I will not stay here again unless they use a traditional check in process like every other hotel. This system looks cool but adds stress time and difficulty to the check in process.
40,Very convenient for going to a show or sporting event. Check in was a breeze through our MLife account. We preregistered the day before and received an email as soon as we landed to say our room was ready. Hallways were a little dark and stuffy but the room was adequate and the bathroom and shower appeared newly renovated super clean and awesome. Staff was very friendly.
50,I stayed here last month & I really can’t fault it. Easy check in perfect location & lovely room. A lot of my days were spent by the pool and I was surprised by how easy it was to get a sun lounger the service at the pool was really good also with people checking to order drinks food etc. The nachos were absolutely massive so I would recommend getting them to share! If I had to moan about one thing it would be the fact the rooms don’t have fridges you really don’t realise how much you use a fridge until you don’t have one. But there is an ice vending machine sort of thing down the hall and the rooms come with an ice bucket so at least that’s something.  Another thing I would recommend is getting the tram from Park MGM to the Belagio! Amazing service I really think it saved me a lot of money being able to do this. All in all was a great trip to Vegas and I would definitely stay here again
50,AMAZING HOTEL Outstanding Services and Food to die for.    This hotel is ideally located in the centre of ALL the craziness that is Las Vegas. Don't forget to eat at the food areas especially Lala Noodles and Bevetti's Fine Steaks
30,Park MGM could be located in Anytown USA. Even passing through the casino it's easy to forget you're in Vegas the hotel is just that boring.    If you want Vegas pizzazz go elsewhere.    If you want any sort of customer service definitely go elsewhere.    Front desk staff need to be retrained they may as well have been mannequins. Had several issues even before check-in and upon arriving realized what the problem was: people who do not care about their job. I expect that at Duane Reade not in a city who's sole existence is customer service. I will not be a repeat guest and will not recommend to friends. As for you strangers: If you get a good rate the standard room is fine decent size boutique-style decor of form over function relatively clean (velour banquette and rugs in room personally gross me out) and on-strip location.
20,"We arrived at the hotel early (930am) and waited hours for a room. The 1st room we got was 2 queen and we had asked for a king. Also the a/c was blowing warm air. The 2nd room had stains in 2 spots on the sheets - I refuse to sleep in a room that has not been adequately cleaned. Finally around 430pm we got the 3rd room that had a queen bed and althought the a/c was not blowing cold air consistently we decided to keep that room and avoid another hours long delay.  On Sunday morning we went to Eataly for breakfast. At the pastry counter my husband pointed to a pastry and said ""I want these right here"" and the tall burly gentleman behind the counter smartly replied ""These? What do you mean by these? What are these?"" This response was rude and uncalled for. I complained to another employee and she apologized and offered to give us free coffee if we returned by 230pm. We did not return to the pastry counter that day - I didnt want to run the risk of being insulted again.  On our last day at your hotel Monday my husband had purchased a couples massage for he and myself for my birthday. I had been looking forward to this trip the stay at your remodeled hotel and a visit to your spa for months and it was an awful experience. As we stood at the spa register waiting to get checked in I noticed a young lady at the 2nd counter next to us. She was being helped by a female employee. I noticed they were speaking and then the young lady's expression changed to one of someone who was visibly upset. Your employee had no reaction nor compassion. As the young lady walked away and out of the spa I literally heard her sobbing. My heart sank. I was then told by the same female employee that I needed to follow her. I asked her ""was that young lady cyring?"" and she replied who and I said the young lady who just left in tears. She replied ""oh do you now her?"" I told her I did not. Honestly it didnt matter. A person should never leave a spa in tears. I was abruptly took me into the ""womens"" area and started rattling off the different amenity locations. Twice I tried to interrupt her - I hadnt even had a chance to say anything to my husband before I was led back. Finally I told her to stop that I hadnt even been allowed a chance to say bye to my husband or to even process what had just happened. She then called the other male employee and asked him to bring my husband back to the front of the spa so that I could speak to him. When I saw my husband I explained to him that I was upset after seeing this young lady leaving in tears and sobbing that I felt so bad for her and although I didnt know what had happened between her and the employee I did not want to get a massage in a place that makes someone cry. I was stressed and almost at the point of tears myself. We talked to the manager who was very gracious and apologetic. He completely understood what my feelings were and even gave us drink vouchers to use while we waited to meet up with the other 3 couples we were traveling with. I have never been to a spa where someone was visibly upset. Nor have I ever been treated so cold or abrupt as I was with the female employee there."
20,Disappointed with this resort advertised as remodeled but felt it was not. Rooms were old dresser given would only fit a child’s wardrobe. Casino more smoky than others. Pool had no sun. Some staff and dealers were absolutely miserable.
10,Room was dated. No coffee maker in room and a bottle of water in the room was $16. No thanks. I won't be staying here again. I had to wait until 6:00 AM to get coffee at the Starbucks in the lobby. A medium coffee and a bottle of water was $11.
20,"Did not receive the room I had paid for restroom was dirty had to clean it myself and service was rude and not helpful their answer was ""well thats what it is""Only thing good about this hotel was eataly."
50,We went for our great granddaughters bday party. Stayed at Park MGM because I had 2 comped rooms. We enjoyed it very much. The room was great! Gambling not so much.  But I would still recommend the hotel.
50,Found a wallet on 11/18/19 took it to the bell desk. security was called Security and the bell staff took care of getting it to the right owner who was also a guest at the resort. Thought it was great customer service.
20,Park MGM is close to T-Mobile but if you want to use a pool or sleep through the night don't say here. Only 1 of 3 pools was accessible and only receives sunlight after 1:30 pm until 3:30 due to the buildings and parking garage in the area. I have been to Vegas over 30 times and never experienced the noise from all night parties in adjoining rooms like we did at the Park MGM despite calling the front desk multiple times who said if we have to call security up to the room again we will have to kick them out and we don;t want to do that so instead we had rave going on next door from 3;15 am to 8:30 when they all fell asleep!
50,I highly recommend this location! Very clean and friendly staff! The rooms were like brand new we were on the 21st floor and it was very quiet. The property has many options for dining or is close to other places.
10,The hotel claims it is new or newly remodeled. This is a false statement. Hallways were dirty and looked like they had not had the carper replaced in a decade and smelled of smoke. My room was on the 18th floor. Hotel claims they are non-smoking but rooms smelled of smoke. Shower only has one speed setting that is super fast and blasting that it hurts to stand under it for more than a minute. Hotel should be rated 1 star not only that but for the service of the staff.
30,"Overpriced ""strip view"" rooms overlook a Ross.  Overpriced Resort fee for such a small pool compared to other MGM properties.  Overpriced Spa Service Charge when you've already paid a resort fee. Would have gone to a nicer spa if told when making the reservation that there was a resort fee and a Spa Service Charge for hotel guests. Stay at the Belagio Aria or even the TI for a better hotel at almost the same cost."
20,Title says it all. Not sure why anyone would stay here when the prices are no better than anywhere else and the services are so poor. No good food options mediocre rooms nothing to do or see in the hotel compared with the competition.
30,This was my second Park MGM stay. I cost Las Vegas 3-5 times a year for 3-4 days at a time. Typically I stay at Luxor but always end up walking north. First Park MGM is smaller and less tourist-filled than other hotels. The average guest is older too. But we WiFi is awful my cell didn’t work anywhere inside the hotel and there are not many options for food other than pasta and more pasta.    The room is a good size with a nice sitting area by the window. Bathroom is a good size and well laid out.    There is only one Starbucks.
30,The hotel and room was nice and what I expected. Every staff member I interacted with was courteous and helpful.  I went to Las Vegas solely for the purpose of seeing Aerosmith. I had VIP tickets on stage which were general admission standing. If you choose not to stand in line for 3 hours to get front row in the general admission section and you are not over 6 feet tall good luck seeing any of the show and just enjoy listening to it. That is what happened to me....terrible view for spending over $1000 for 2 tickets.
40,We have been staying at MGM properties for 6 years. This our first stay at the Park MGM. The rooms are spacious but poorly appointed. There is a nice table but only 1 chair. Only four small drawers in the closet to store clothes....not enough. No room around the bathroom sink. Very disappointed in the room itself. The shower is the best part. Great water flow. Could use more hooks in the bathroom for towels washcloths clothes etc. The casino looks smaller than it used to be. No reasonable place to get breakfast.
30,Slow Drain in Bathroom. Some of the plugs in the room didnt work.  Other than that Nice Hotel. Perfect Location. The Eataly had tons of great options for food. A little over priced. The Off The Record Club was only open on Wednesday Friday and Saturday. Which I thought it should have been open every night.
20,I’ve stayed at 11 hotels on the strip & have never had this many issues ANYWHERE. The location food and pricing is great that’s why we chose to stay here for a second time BUT highly doubt we will come back. We had issues BOTH stays with employees just don’t need to deal with that on a vacation.
30,Every staff member we interacted with was just wonderful and very helpful but the room was very on interesting the carpet was worn out and dirty the table had big chips in it as if it wasn’t well taken care of there was no alarm clock in the room no place to put any of your stuff it was just disgusting the bathroom itself was fairly modern but the room was horrible
30,Simple basic stay. As in no spark nor best feature in the room. A couple of fixes needed as in the shower handle being very loose. Constantly goes down to the burning side of the hot water and won't stay in the just right zone. Another problem was the TV being lopsided and constantly coming out leaning forward. I know it's adjustable but it's loose and won't stay in the same spot either. No bathtub no jacuzzi. Just a regular shower. Small drawers to put your clothes in. 5 slots but very small small closet. TV loses signal every now and then as in it gets fuzzy and freezes. Front desk takes over 5-7minutes to answer even though there's self check-in and self-out. It was just an okay stay nothing special to enjoy. No complimentary breakfast. No perks on staying in the hotel besides a small discount to primrose in the lobby.
30,It meet all the minimum hotel standards - I had a place to lock my things in the day and sleep at night. But there were lots of places to improve.    First they need better IT. The idea of automated check in and check out is great  Their system is buggy and broken and takes longer than just going ahead with human check in.    Second housekeeping was inconsistent. Towels replaced every day even when I hung them up so I could reuse them. And they added new shampoo (even though I never used it.) But they never replaced body wash (which I did use). They also left dirty glassware in the room instead of replacing it with a clean one. Not sure what I was supposed to do with a dirty glass. It's never come up at even the cheapest motels.
40,We went to Vegas for the Fleetwood Mac concert. I got tickets through M Life Rewards. I couldn't figure out where to pick up my tickets so I spoke with the Concierge and was told to go to my casino host. I had my tickets in 5 minutes. The people who work at the Hotel/Casino are amazing. The hotel is beautiful staff is very friendly and helpful.
10,If this is what hotel automation looks like hotel workers need not worry about losing their jobs. There were around 15 agents helping people figure out how to use the automated check in equipment. I was lucky and only had to stand in line twice. The person in front of me was in line for the 4th time. Since the rooms weren't ready on time we were told we could check in luggage at the bell hop desk. Good luck with that. That line was worse than the check in line. We were only the 4th person in the bell hop line...after 30 minutes waiting we gave up. We waited for over an hour for the room (they were suppose to text us) and finally went back to registration. After standing in line again we were told the room still wasn't ready (after 4pm). 5 minutes later I got the text so you got it i was again able to stand in line to get my key printed out. Watch the fine print if you book. There is an additional resort fee (not listed in the daily fee) which is another $50/night. For what you ask? For the internet service which was openly available anyway. I suggest the Pallazio. Now that is a value.
50,"my first time staying at Park MGM. It was an amazing experience! Staff was great and the drink service was awesome! There ""Eatery"" area was amazing. Lots of variety and upscale food at reasonable prices."
50,If or When you visit Vegas a must do top of the list is Book a massage at Park MGM The Spa! Sophia is the most gifted masseur I’ve ever met not only because she is quite experienced but her technique will leave you feeling refreshed and relaxed! Thank you for all you do Sophia I certainly look forward to my next visit!
40,I would definitely recommend this hotel. What I liked most was that unlike other hotels in Vegas you don't have to walk for a half hour to get to your room! The rooms were clean and the bed was comfortable. There is a tram available which takes you to Bellagio. The hotel is also in the perfect location to the T-Mobile Arena.
30,"self service check in--they charge a ""resort fee"" but didn't feel like a ""resort"" if I do everything myself. Hallways were dark--our party referred to it as the ""Overlook Hotel"". Cleaning staff excellent-but the rooms were not well appointed--no mini fridge or microwave. Very basic. Staff in general was friendly. Eataly-food was good--service at some of the locations was not great--especially when you are ordering pizza by the slice because you are in a hurry."
10,SERVICE: Many employees' jobs are now done by machines. Most of the employees are fine when you can find one.    NOISE: The constant bass beat of the music was impossible to block out of my room and it continued until after 2:00 am. Every night was a bad night of little sleep.    SMOKE: Nearly everywhere inside and outside the hotel was smoky. It was so bad that I spent most of my time in the restaurants and casinos of OTHER HOTELS.    DINING: I do not know how they could have made the dining experience more difficult. I was even refused service by one employee and threatened by another.    I will NEVER even consider returning to this awful place.
20,Rooms are big but lack basic amenity (no kettle  tea bags/coffee bags etc) right in front of stadium so noise is at high level on game day. Check-in has automated machines but in my case they didnt work. Room service for food available but super expensive
50,Wish we had more than one night to stay here. Beautiful nice views from the room loved playing roulette all night. Great food at Primrose but Eataly is a SKIP at least the pizza n pasta portion maybe the other counter services are better. Very comfortable beds and pillows.
20,The location was average because well it's the strip. All staff encountered were lovely and the resort was clean. The room was a disappointment. Apparently the decorator was going for arty and ended up with pretentiously garish. Practical design of the bathroom was substandard and the decision to leave coffee makers refrigerators and microwaves out of the rooms was a serious mistake. Having s choice of either paying $6/cup + $4.50delivery fee to the room plus tip OR walk to the far exit of the hotel in the morning to retrieve coffee is heartless at best.
30,room was small not amazing amenities and overall not the best bang for your BUCK. Staff wasn't the friendliest but some staff members were amazing  Food was amazing and star-bucks was KEY  will come back not to PARK
50,This was my second stay at Park MGM and it’s been great each time. This hotel is in a perfect location on the strip. Park MGM is close to many shops and restaurants. Our process for check in was exceptional where we had four rooms where they were able to get us in the same floor near the elevators. I will stay with them again for sure.
50,Great location in the heart of the strip. The room was really comfortable and quiet. The casino had a good vibe and a great soundtrack. The casino is not as big as some of its neighbours but the atmosphere is way better
30,So first time staying at Park not overly impressed does not compare favorably with the MGM Grand much smaller in scale rooms not impressive at all alot of green plastic in not very appealing shades staff seem nice restaurants suck out of alot of items and not very diverse in selection tables were hot thank
40,The rooms are spacious clean and the staff is wonderful and so helpful. Check-in is a breeze too. It’s in a good location to walk to many places. Eataly is a MUST! Such an experience! I will stay there again.
50,This was a great place to stay with friendly staff. The food was awesome and the bars were great. The casino is a fun atmosphere and it’s right next to the the T-Mobile arena! I absolutely love this place!
10,I had a miserable one night stay at this hotel. First of all the room while otherwise ok was very noisy. Crying baby on one side and party with loud music and talking on the other. The sound went right through the walls. I finally had to complain to the front desk. Also even though we were on the 25th floor you could still hear cars and street noise. They did not do a good soundproofing job when they renovated the Monte Carlo to this hotel. The bed was very lumpy and uncomfortable and made it hard to get to sleep. I also did not like the check-in and check out procedure. It was all done on touch-screen computers with no ability to go to the check-in desk unless you were an elite member of the casino club. It would have been nice to have the option to deal with a person and get information about the hotel room types and locations. Finally although I was staying on Hyatt points I was still charged a $41 resort fee which Hyatt normally does not charge on award redemptions. When I asked what I got for the resort fee I was basically told wifi the pool and use of the casino. Noner of which I used in my 17 hour stay. Parking at an additional $15 a day was not included nor water a bar drink food credit or another else of value. So basically the fee is a rip-off which inflates the room rate but adds nothing of value to what the hotel normally offers.    If you have to stay on the strip there are much better options.
40,I enjoyed my stay. Great location at a good price. Check-in was so quick and convenient!!! My only problem was the windows in my room were dirty. I had a great view though. I would definitely come back again.
30,The location is ideal for anyone going to T Mobile arena. right next door. There is a lack of food options in the hotel late at night. It is a clean property. A good amount of bars. The sports book is average to above average (not a typical sports book). On our trip getting a cock tail waitress at table games was few and far between.
30,There was a noise with air conditioning unit.. It wakes me up every time that makes the noise. You are trying to rob the customers on water bottles.. You can charge what makes sense fro you but provide better service on that price.
10,We thought the resort was refurbished but the room we were allocated was not what we expected. Very small and the center light was connected using electrical conduit to a power receptacle on the wall. Reminded me of a room I would expect at a Motel 6
50,MGM Park used to be the Monte Carlo. They have been upgrading the place for a while now and have done a terrific job. There are a number of excellent new restaurants on the premises. Its not as frantic as many other casinos so you can have fun and still relax. The location is amazing with NYNY and Aria on either side and a tram that goes all the way to Bellagio.
50,We really enjoyed out recent stay at the Park MGM in Las Vegas! From the minute we parked (extremely easy accessibility!) to check-in (Front Desk staff Ashley was outstanding!) and the beautiful room view and comfort of the bed furniture and ambiance we knew we were in for a wonderful vacation stay in Las Vegas! The restaurants were fantastic with many delicious options and professional staff. The location is such a perfect spot on the strip to be near so many other fun Vegas adventures to enjoy. We will definitely be back next year to stay at the PARK MGM!
30,Vacation week to see the PBR Finals go to some shows and have some warmer weather. The week was great for weather went to the Grand Canyon for a day excellent trip. Saw some great entertainment and only downsize was the cost of eating. Prices have really gone up.
10,The only thing Park MGM has going for it is the proximity to the T Mobil Arena. Rooms are terrible amenities are terrible. No storage in rooms the furniture looks like it has been there since the 70s. There are no coffee makers and extremely limited availability in the casino. The prices for the bar items in the room are nothing short of outrageous. $16 for a bottle of water!
40,We booked a golf trip through Sterling Golf Services and stayed at Park MGM. Everything was planned to a very well and the hotel was very nice. The staff was very nice and the hotel was a great value.
30,Lack of coffee machines and not enough coffee shops that were NOT a Starbucks aside this was a comfortable bed to sleep in and a decent shower. Unfortunately the lack of access to better coffee was a huge problem for me. Had one decent Lavazze coffee when we had time to get over there. Decor was cool I enjoyed all the gallery walls and art.
10,even list. Purchase an $80 bottle of champagne downstairs and then request glasses from room service. Only plastic cups available for $12 and a $4 charge plus tip to bring them to your room. No place to put your clothes in the king rooms. Fine unless you have suits or don't live out of your suitcase.
40,My second stay at the Park MGM and it won't be my last. Great staff wonderful restaurants excellent maid service valet service and great location for anything at T Mobile arena. would recommend to family and friends.
30,Stayed here for a work conference where my only other options that were close to the Mandalay convention center were Luxor Excalibur or New York New York. This seemed to have the best price for a 4 star hotel and I was excited to try out the food at Eataly.    Check-in has gone the more automated route which I understand is the trend these days. Automation vs. hiring more people. I can see how this can be a challenge for those who like the more personal touch I honestly just want to check in and get my room ASAP. The rooms while they are refreshed felt a little old. Not sure if that makes sense. The beds and pillows were surprisingly comfortable considering hotels are notorious for super soft pillows. Other reviewers complained about the thin walls and I will second that. It was weird to hear my neighbors. At the end of the day it's not a bad hotel to sleep in chances are you're most likely going to be out and about.    Eataly was a nice touch for foodie but I wish there were more breakfast options.
40,Was ok would have liked a regular check in or more assistants walking around to help. Ceilings in the hallways were low but that’s ok. Was there a smell pumped in? When the ac turned on in the room it smelled like Victoria’s Secret
50,The Park MGM was absolutely incredible from its location to locals night was a plus!! Bavettes steakhouse was the best steak we have ever ate!! The rest of the restaurants were good as well!! Eately is quite the experience!
50,At every juncture we were met with graciousness and professionalism. Exceptional service georgous autmosphere and amentities. Will absolutely return on my next visit to Las Vegas. The Lady Gaga concert was amazing!
40,The rooms and staff are wonderful. The dinning however was poor.  You need better restaurants that are more affordable so your guest don’t have to go elsewhere to dine.  Put coffee pots back in the rooms this would make the trip more enjoyable.
10,Unfortunately this was the most unpleasant hotel stay I have had. The temperature in the room was off - I set the thermostat to cool to 66 but the room was boiling. The bed and pillows were particularly uncomfortable. Check-in was chaos: it was automated but 2/3 of the machines were not working and every guest at the machines that were working still required assistance. However there was only one employee available to assist. I battled my way through glitches before staff was able to help. I would normally not provide this type of review but it was a really disappointing stay overall.
40,If you're looking for location then this is the spot to be at. Everything is going to be in a very short walking distance. The restaurants are okay besides La La Noodle it's not worth the money at all.
50,The hotel was clean and fresh. My room was perfect the washroom immaculate. Staff was friendly and welcoming. The casino was easy to navigate and the music was great. A perfect two day stay. Thank you!
50,Welcome weekend PRB. Had a great time with friends and family. Went to music concert bull riding expo shop eat high end restaurant. Perfect location just a shot walk to everything.great room  black out curtains
40,Checked in with VIP services fast and friendly. Beds and pillows were super cozy the best I’ve had in Vegas. Upon entering room there was a black tray by the tv which was empty later to find out it was their “mini bar”. Stayed Sunday-Thursday finally on Wednesday when maid service came in it was replenished. Would have been nice to have but thank god I didn’t get charged for anything. Also put the do not disturb sign out early Monday morning maid service still knocked on door twice. When leaving for adventures Monday afternoon noticed the sign was taken/gone. Didn’t have the sign for the rest of stay
10,So disappointed with this place. I had high expectations of the Monte Carlo going through an extreme renovation and re branding. unfortunately they have failed in every way. From Cold and dark check ins horrible room service to stinky elevators and broken toilets. Not something i would expect from a place that used to have some of the best customer service and welcoming hotels i had ever stayed at. They just lost a great customer of 15 plus years.
20,I just thought I would of been introduced to a VIP host and just be treated like a VIP player but I was not treated special at all and it was disappointing I was always treated like one at palms and at Cosmo and hard rock and bellagio and Venetian and mandaly and the Rio and Tropicana and the Venetian
50,The smell in the room was terrible. The concert we faced at night was impossible to get any sleep. No late checkout however I understand it was very busy week with SEMA.    If these things could have been corrected it would have been one of the best places we had ever stayed in Vegas.
40,Great lounges and food options. Smaller hotel allows you to engage casino staff easy to navigate. Check out Best Friends for good Korean eats and Juniper for great drinks (try a MOMO). Great concert venue in Park MGM.. saw lady gaga's piano and jazz concert
30,My daughter and I just spent two nights at the Park MGM as we were in Vegas for Lady Gaga’s Enigma show. The hotel was fine but that’s about all. The check in machines seemed to make check in slower rather than faster although we did find them to be good for check out. The hotel is of course fantastically convenient if you are seeing a show at the theatre but apart from that I think there are probably better options to stay in Vegas.
30,For the amount it costs to stay we had no refrigerator no dresser minimum space to put out clothes there was a sewage smell in certain areas of the first level maybe install an automatic air freshener system the slot machines are very tight hardly any wins and you have to pay a daily resort fee on top of a daily deposit way too many charges
40,Rooms are nice and clean. Location on the strip is great. The only problem was check-in. They have an automated check-in that is difficult to use. There is no check-in desk like other hotels. No staff to assist if you have problems. The first day the casino slots were tight. However the second day was more loose.
30,The old Monte Carlo ... the rooms are okay. Very clean cost effective but the only problem was that I received an adjoined room so you can really hear your neighbors at odd times when you are trying to sleep. The food options and casino floor were fun though.
10,"Stayed at this hotel because I had tickets to Lady Gaga show ( excellent entertainment by the way).  Other than that convenience there is no reason to stay here. Check in via kiosk with a few staff milling about with iPads who were unable to answer simple questions! No one to tell you about hotel amenities... or where us roomlocated. I arrived at 2 (check is at 3)& no room available... got a text at 4 that room was ready. Turns out to be 2 queen beds instead of 1 king bed. Call to discuss and was told ""too bad no King rooms available in hotel"". Ordered room service - took1 hour arrived in paper containers with plastic utensils and was cold. At check-out I had question about bill - but no one was able to answer. Terrible experience."
30,The Room was average boardering on poor. The room was outdated had stains on the carpet old couch in the room. I called to see if we could get a bigger ice bucket or a 2nd one (ice bucket was very small) they told me to use the trash can. I found the check in process to be poor. They have a kiosk checkin which didn't work very well. At first the computer couldn't find the reservation it took several attempts with the attendant assisting us just not a great experience. I don't mind paying for a great meal or a great room but I don't like to feel taken advantage of bought two small bottles of booze in the lobby which anywhere in the county retail for under $50 (way under) and they charged nearly $120. If the room/hotel/casino were of that caliber it would be palatable but this is not that kind hotel. Just my opinion
50,The most flexible experience on the Strip. Just small enough (NoMad included) just perfect for artists at Park Theater innovative restaurants like Mama Rabbit and Best Friend and Eataly. Eat small or large whenever tram to Aria and Bellagio for quick movement relax in the Park just outside the door. It is my place to stay when in Las Vegas.
20,Loud rooms since they are across stadium BOTH MY PARTNER AND I HAD SEVERE ALLERGIES DUE TO ROOM BEING DUSTY AND AC TURNING OFF WHEN LEAVING THE ROOM DUE TO ENERGY EFFICIENCY. I could've sworn I left my towel on the floor to be changed only to find it later folded in between the new ones gross
30,"The Park is an updated property but is very bland. The room reserved was changed upon our timely arrival where we were given some sort of ""Stay Well"" room even though we paid extra for a different room facing the strip.    This is a good establishment and worth your stay but the décor throughout including the rooms is bland. No refrigerators no in room coffee and just know that the room you book could possibly not be the room you book. Staff was good the establishment and rooms very clean. The beds and linens were respectably comfotable."
10,"Upon check in you are greeted with an array of 20 computer screens where you should check in....there is a single person to help if there are issues.....at least 15 of us had issues which resulted in a very long and disatifying wait to check in...    We were there for a concert that was cancelled about an hour before it should have started....that's not MGMs fault...but have the concierge leave at 6pm (concert starts at 7pm) meant there was not a single person to discuss options with. We literally had to go to the next proprty (Aria) to have any help.  I did try to call the front desk during our time....shocking...NO ANSWER....I tried 5 times.....NO ANSWER    Checkout - same......just a computer terminal.    Look I'm a tech nerd I generally prefer not to have to talk to people and if this place turned me off....any ""normal"" person is straight gonna hate it."
40,everything was great and pleasant no stress what so ever. it was my time to reset from work and i was able to do so. rooms were very comfortable and the shower was relaxing and no worries about not enough water or it going cold fast. just a great experience
10,The casino and lobby area was very nice. Except for the dirty ceilings that obviously didn't get re-painted or cleaned in the renovation process. The hotel room itself was not accommodating. The sliding door for the bathroom/closet area is dangerous and ridiculous. And no dresser in the room so you had to live out of your suitcase. Not impressed at all.
20,poor service at the gaming tables - rude and unhelpful. Concert woke me up at 1am service overall mediocre at best. Some decent food options but overall not somewhere I would go back to considering price and lack of service
10,Reserved Strip View room but as our window shades were broken we didn't get to see much of the 'view.' After 3 calls and assurances that someone would be there in 30 minutes we gave up. Didn't want to spend all our time in a hotel room where you can't see out the window. (Nobody ever came.) Add that to our safe being locked open and unusable to us (also reported multiple times.) Saturday morning there was exactly 1 roulette table open. 1 table. We actually stood in line to give them our money. At 10:00 after much urging they opened another table. 2 tables on a Saturday morning?? I bet the Bellagio had more than 1 table open. We stayed there last time but we wanted to give them a try as they were advertised as 'the newest.' NEVER AGAIN. (I'm not even going to talk about the raw sewage smell) But don't worry I've told all my friends.
20,Not a great experience from the check in decormaintenance and etc. If you transition from Park MGM to Aria get used to the smell of sewage it was prevalent every day. Eately needs to remove a few of the Pizza options otherwise it was fine.
10,Long time traveler to Vegas but First time visit to Park MGM. Early family. We were given a room that could hear the club’s base all night long from 11pm to 4am which would NOT let my family (baby included) or I sleep. Paid a little more money to see how the new brand does. Failed should of kept Monte Carlo.    Poor ratings and I do not recommend establishments. I can clearly say that this was the worst stay in Vegas.
50,Great service quality food and drinks. This is the place to stay in Vegas. Wife and I had a blast at the casino from the tales to slots. Food is great so many choices so many bars with great unique drinks. The room by far the best part large quite right off the elevator and so spacious with great views of the strip. Stay stay stay
50,Fantastic resort hotel venue. Would recommend to all. Eataly was our favourite experience - food wine and cocktails were fabulous. Location on the strip is great. Rooms were beautifully decorated clean and modern.
30,"I've no desire to stay here again. I found our room very nice and adequate. Loved the steakhouse. Super location on The Strip especially next to the Park Theater.    I dislike the ""Self Checkin"" kiosk style. It is impersonal and didn't work. The assistant acted like he didn't want to help me. Tried twice then sent to the VIP main desk for help. Nice guys and gals there. But the Concierge seems very bothered to help us most of the time. The Self Check out went better and I handled fine.    We also like Primrose for lunch.  BUT when did Las Vegas food prices in restaurants get to be so high and expensive? Overpaid for Primrose horrible omlettes and average salmon bagel.    Excellent Manhattan drink at steakhouse and loved our fill packed baked potatoes - real bargain. Delicious filet mignon too.    The Eatery is where you need to go for coffee since there is no coffeemaker in room. (Hated that!) and Starbucks is packed with customers and you'll wait forever in lines.    Casino is nothing special absolutely average noisy.  NO THEME... seems like a business hotel.    Pools - only one open at end of season. Crowded in hot tub but pool was very nice.  PROBLEM: there's only a couple hours of sunshine!!! Freezing in the shadows of the neighboring skyscrapers!!!!    AND  the ONLY place on the property that isn't blasting with loud pop music is in the Conference Halls area! I discovered this at the end when I found the Business FedEx office to print out a boarding pass.    There are many much more fun places to stay!"
50,My wife and I just got back from a week in Las Vegas. We stayed at the MGM Park. We've stayed there quite a few times in the past few years. Even while construction was going on. It's nice to see all the hard work come to fruition.  This trip was to commemorate my wife's 50th birthday and our 19th anniversary which happen a few days apart. Our room was on the 22 floor overlooking the pools. I like the rooms there isn't a lot of storage but I'm not one to unpack anyway. There was enough room for my wife to unpack as that is her thing. Loved the shower great pressure and lots of hot water.  The bed was comfortable I'm not big on their pillows but managed to sleep well anyway.  I wish the casino had a poker room but otherwise I always enjoy my stay here.
20,It’s one of the Okayist places to stay on the strip. Don’t expect much customer service or any perks from this place. Rooms are clean. The location is the best part of the hotel if you are going to watch Lady Gaga.
20,MGM has done everything possible to remove any personal touch and welcome from your visit. They have made it where you can arrive play automated games and leave without ever interacting with a live person. If you like that and outside band/music noise in your room then this is a perfect hotel for you. On the other hand if you want a personal touch with hotel dining options opt for a different property.
30,Rooms are not as updated as they advertise. Looks like they remodeled the bathrooms and painted the walls after converting from Monte Carlo to Park MGM. To get to your floor you have to scan your room key and press the floor button but cannot go to any other floor.
50,We decided on the park mgm for our trip this year since it was renovated. It was the Monte Carlo previously. Overall this was an excellent hotel  the vibe was great and it was crazy like other hotels. If you want be at an overcrowded hotel that’s gets way too wild stay somewhere else. The staff were all helpful and check in was a self check in system that was super easy. The pool and hot tub area were nice and my wife said the spa was great as well. The hotel it attached to the tram the goes to the aria and the Bellagio which makes for easy access.
10,"I wish I could assign this hotel a zero. Here is what I wrote to the Park MGM when they asked in a survey whether I would ever recommend their hotel to a friend or colleague:    Where to begin? The outrageous noise and vibrating bass coming from the club below would be enough to NEVER EVER recommend this hotel to anyone else but I think the primary reason for this 0 rating stems from the useless and in our view dishonest reaction from the Front Desk when we asked to switch rooms (after what was turning into a second sleepless night due to noise and vibrations). We asked to switch rooms and were told that the noise was the same in every room in every wing on every floor. Not only is this completely untrue its not even consistent with what another employee told us. I asked what then could they do about the ridiculous level of noise and bass vibrations in our room? Though the obvious response would be to put us in a different room We were instead offered a ""sleep kit"" which I understand merely consists of ear plugs. What will these ear plugs do for the fact that my bed shakes with each pulse of the bass? ""Nothing"" she says. It will do nothing. The kicker is that after the music died around (after 3am) it sounded like some maniac slapped our door and then continued to howl whilst running thru the halls. In fact we heard many screaming and shouting guests though the walls are so thin its impossible to say whether they were on our floor or 4 floors below. In any event we were kept up long after the music died down. It was obvious from our calls to the front desk that the staff is fully aware of the all of the noise issues but nobody cares enough to make a serious effort to remedy them.    Paper thin walls the fact you should NEVER feel the bass of a dance club in the walls and floor on the 22nd floor of ANY hotel or building immature guests and a completely clueless front desk = Zero Rating (which I really wish was an option). Convenient location by the arena but we are never returning to this hotel.    If you stay out all night you might miss out on the free vibrating bed (which goes until about 3am on a saturday) but if you expect to get any sleep during normal hours look elsewhere. Granted not everyone in vegas is trying to sleep before 3am but it should always be a possibility and even with earplugs this wasn't an option for us in our room."
50,Chose to stay here cos we had tickets for Lady Gaga but I would stay here again in a heartbeat.  I can’t say enough about the excellent service—and they were slammed with Gaga Bull Riding Championships and the Marine Corps Ball. (Example: We paid for early check in. When the room was not ready as promised they upgraded us to a nicer room that was ready and took off the early check-in fee. )  Also the concierge helped us score good tickets to Opium at a fraction of the price hooked us up with free drink tickets and told us how to find a “secret” bar at the Cosmopolitan. There was not a single person during our 4 day stay that wasn’t friendly helpful and willing to go the extra step.  The room was perfect; super clean and well appointed. The beds and pillows were dreamy. The AC rocked and the room was quiet.  The location was ideal—either a short walk or the tram. T-Mobile arena is right on the doorstep.  And lastly—“Eataly” is downstairs with all its fabulous food and wine. The little deli has amazing food wine and bread for reasonable prices that we took to the room for our own happy hour.
50,This was our first time in Las Vegas and we chose this hotel because it was where Lady Gaga was performing which we had already bought tickets for (no review for that she cancelled 😱). It was actually a great choice for lots of other reasons - very near the airport (no noise pollution great double or triple glazing) right on the strip next door to T-mobile arena and has a free tram to the Bellagio of dancing fountains fame. We aren’t gamblers (probably should have been run out of Dodge for that) so can’t rate the casino but the in-house restaurants we tried were great especially La La Noodle which was friendly with delicious food although on a downside the Primrose bar wasn’t the friendliest. The hotel store is pricey ($8 for a basic sandwich). Check-in is via self directed consoles but with lots of staff on hand to help. With the exception of the bar staff in Primrose all of the staff we met were really good - friendly efficient security conscious (we came back to our room while the housekeeper was doing it and she asked us to prove it was our room by using our key - excellent) and generally lovely. Special thanks go to the woman at Park Theater who kindly gave us a food voucher when Lady Gaga cancelled and she heard it was our 30th anniversary celebration and to Patrícia Arroyo at the concierge desk who was nothing short of superb in helping us book our other day trips and shows (it turns out that reimbursed Lady G tickets buys quite a lot!). If we come back to Las Vegas Park MGM will be the first hotel we look at. Thank you!
50,Everyone treated my husband and I very kindly. The staff did not hesitate to meet our immediate and necessary needs. Very compassionate yet professional. Rooms were pristine. All staff greeted and smiled whenever they saw us approaching. Always eager to help!
50,Amazing service. Fast check-in/out. Convenient location for everything Vegas. Never any wait for an elevator even though it was a busy convention weekend. Thoughtful crossing guards at the crosswalk to keep everyone moving along safely.
40,over all I rate this average  the Mlife perks not as good as it was in the past . Casino very nice people that work there  very helpful . Wish the room would get cooler  had a hard time sleeping  valet was good
40,Great value centrally located on the Strip close to the T-mobile Stadium and easy to navigate through the hotel. Standard rooms are a little smaller and compact than most but hey who comes to Vegas to sleep anyway? The bedding is soft and comfortable and the room was immaculately clean. No coffee maker tea kettle microwave or refrigerator in the room. There is a TV couch chair small table small armoire shelf bed and two night tables with a thin shelf above the bed. We used the couch for a luggage rack to keep from tripping over the bags. The hotel check in and out is via a kiosk in the main lobby. The process was simple convenient and modern. Shoppes food and beverage locations are scattered throughout the Park atmosphere - it does feel as if you are walking around a large City Park! I love what they did and it completely transforms what used to be the Monte Carlo - it is hard to believe it was the same hotel. We will stay again!
40,Awesome new hotel. Great vibe and incredible theater. We loved the Haus of Gaga displaying all her costumes from different shows etc. the hotel offers great restaurants and amenities. The Little Italy was fabulous and offered great Italian options.
50,Excellent value convenient location. Excellent restaurant options but food is pricey. Yes I would stay here again. Pool is heated. Walking distance to shops by Aria hotel. Eataly is an upscale food court.
40,The location is good. Service and the room are good. However there are no refrigerators in the rooms. That is my only complaint. I would have liked to have kept some cold water in my room. The Eatery was delicious!
30,I stayed here when it was the Monte Carlo. Updates have been made but the prices have sky rocketed! The restaurants are also to high priced. Lots of things to do in Vegas but plan on spending a lot of money.
10,Of the four days there housekeeping only serviced the room once. Had to call each night to get fresh towels and soap. Their excuse was that housekeeping was extremely busy. Although the hotel recently opened again the rooms don't feel like they have been renovated. The hallways were clearly fresh with new carpet though. I thought this was a more upscale hotel but the rooms at New York New York are much nicer. These reminded me of a Best Western or similar. The air conditioning also would not cool the room. Very hot and difficult to sleep.
50,We loved the mobile check in/check out so easy and efficient. We went for the Lady GAGA concert...I love that we can walk into the venue for the show. The Haus of GAGA museum was fun. We like the Eataly area with lots of place for Italian food. Walk out onto the strip and their Uber area is easy to use. Affordable and very nice rooms. We loved it!
40,Booked two nights in Stay Well King for the Gaga Piano and Jazz concert. First time at this hotel after the remodel / rebranding so hard to compare a standard room v the Stay Well room. Checked in via mobile app and collected our keys at the kiosks without problem. Downloaded the Stay Well app to see what amenities differentiated it from a standard room. I guess the air purifier and the shower infuser were the best things about it. Nice artwork in the room and throughout the property. Gym was pretty full but there were plenty of cardio machines. Lots of deck space at the pool but not a lot of actual water for swimming. 3 pools for cooling off and dipping into. No more lazy river. Eataly and Best Friend were top notch dining locales.
40,Nice hotel with a nice casino. Lots of eating choices. May be a Vegas thing but they hit you with a $37 resort fee and $4.95 resort fee tax per day at checkout. The Nomad restaurant was very good but very expensive.
50,One of my favorite things about Park MGM is that it's not as big as other casinos on the strip. I've stayed at MGM and for me it's just too big. Park MGM has a more personal feel. The restaurants are excellent. We love Primrose Bavettes & Eataly
30,Not a spectacular hotel. Stayed at Aria and there isn’t a comparison. Automated check in stinks. Room itself was only fair and TV had a lousy selection of channels. View of Strip was very nice.  Restaurants only fair.
20,We stayed there when it was the Monte Carlo and it was horrible. They painted the walls added fancy check in counter and changed the name but it is still the Monte Carlo we stayed in years ago and did not like it then. Could not get any room service as it was delayed 1.5 hrs. Could not get table at building restaurant as it was delayed seating as well. So we ate away from hotel which involves getting showered and dressed just to eat. 1 block away to the north is the Aria stay there instead. Pricing is the same but miles better overall.
40,Hotel was in a very good location The Casino had very poor ventilation choking smoke hazard. Primrose food was poor but Eatily was great. Good food and atmosphere. Housekeeping was great. Bell desk misplaced some baggage.
50,My stay was pure joy. The staff rooms and dinning experience was exceptional. The outside grounds gave me a small town feel yet we were in vegas baby. The location is great. The park across the street was an added bonus. Oh yes having the tram connection from the hotel worked out great. Great way to travel the strip.
20,Arrived from airport at 10:30 had a meeting at 2pm.. Was told hotel was over booked!!? How does that happen I'm this century?? Uncalled for. Told desk needed room to change for a meeting.told me would rush...yeah right.that was 3:48!! Wasted a full day. Yetstill had to pay for it?!?
20,The Park MGM is a decent hotel in a good location on the strip. Very close to many of the shows as well as the T-Mobile Arena.    The problem is their automated check-in process is Terrible. It's sad to see so many customer experience opportunities moving to poorly automated computer mishaps.    I've stayed here a few times now and my room has never been ready upon arrival. Good thing I made a reservation.    Getting to your hotel after a flight only to find your hotel room isn't ready is bummer enough but being put on hold by a computer that can't give you any estimate adds to the frustration.    Trying to find out information from the concierge only made me more mad as I felt talked down to by the first human representative of the Park MGM.    We really do like the property. We enjoy eating at Eataly and we like being in this area of the strip when we stay..the customer service is just non-existent.    Meanwhile me and my pregnant wife sit in the lobby just a few hours before our concert plans. Big swing and a miss by Park MGM!
10,I’m not sure I’ve ever had a reason to write a scathing review of anywhere I’ve ever stayed and I travel a lot. So fair warning.    I got lady Gaga tickets and a three night stay at the MGM Grand . I “upgraded” to the Park MGM and was sorry I did from the minute I walked in the door    Not a single soul offered to help with my bags. (I had two since I was traveling onto a different climate from Vegas for a week) There is self check in with very few helpers floating around and again not a single soul offered me bellman services.    The hallways are dark and dingy the room was small and tired with a level view of the roof accompanied by the air conditioning and heating vents and general HVAC mess. The place was booked so I couldn’t move rooms.    I’m not sure our room was ever vacuumed since the same huge ball of string from  one of our bags was left there for  3 days. After the first day I left it there as a test. It’s still there as I left the hotel.    Towels were motel grade and there was a huge gap in the shower door so we had a flood.    Customer service was lacking from every department except the food service people. They and the bartenders were friendly helpful  and fun to be around. The Casino staff were also great.    As far as help from anyone else regarding anything you needed like bill info or checking in and out they were all rude except for one girl Mica and another who’s name I can’t remember who was kind enough to help me after her male colleague was rude nasty and blew me off. And you need help since they have a horrible self check in and check out system that didn’t once work for me. When I went to the VIP desk for help he had no idea how to help me. Again no offer of help with my bags.    Babette’s for dining was fabulous. Great bartender Gustavo made our meal at the bar fun and interesting. He was definitely a highlight of our stay.    I’ll take the Wynn or even the Palazzo anytime over the Park MGM.
50,Overall I really like this hotel. Great location easy access to other casinos and strip. Min. Bets are reasonable. Rooms are all newly renovated and clean. Check in process is simple with no waits. I would definitely recommend to anyone.
40,Check in was horrible- over reliance on technology for check in. Only 1 person at the desk when the online system was giving up issues. Waited 1/2 hour for assistance. Be careful of the shower water built up and door only opens out - so water poured all over the floor. Sigh. But comfy room great location and good food.
50,My first time staying at Park MGM and it’s my new favorite hotel in Las Vegas. I always stay at the MGM Grand and felt like a change. So glad I did! Firstly the check in was so smooth (unlike the MGM Grand where the average wait time to check in was normally about an hour crazy). Room was nice and clean. View of the roof but who stays in their room in Vegas anyway? Loved the Eataly concept - each morning I walked past about 40 people waiting in line for coffee at Starbucks to order coffee and an Italian pastry at the Eataly coffee stand so much better! Didn’t spend much time in the casino but it was definitely smaller than most. Staff were lovely. Would highly recommend Park MGM and I’ll be back!
50,very convenient to aria and cosmo convention center as well as t-mobile arena. hotel used to be monte carlo nicely updated rooms and a cool italian marketplace restaraunt area with variety of authentic italian food and wines
50,We were a family of 6 celebrating my son's birthday. I decided to stay here because it was central to many other casinos/hotel and had read that many young visitors visited and bars would play younger generation music. Since my family was under the age of 30's and my husband and I are in our 50's we stayed here. It was a great experience for all of us. I truly enjoyed the music vibe and the casino. Loved the bars and restaurants. I would stay here again. The rooms were clean not 5 star but nice and clean. Hallways were a bit dark but overall we all had an excellent time.
20,"First time staying here I expect a lot since I had dinner at this hotel last time and the hotel it self looks great so I decided to stay at Park MGM this time. The ""Room"" is bad......... does not worth the price at all cheap design. I would rather spend $30-$50 more to stay at Aria Hotel also the size of the room is small."
50,So - check in was ok although the king room wasn’t initially honored we worked it out after a couple of hour wait at the bar.    Dining is slow especially at the restaurant next to check in. It also seems you can sit at a table which will never get served - it’s a round table at the front and apparently it does not receive service - it’s weird right?    On our last night we were woken up to a person next door playing the drums. They were playing them really well but please 4:30am!!? What? We called security after 45 mins and it stopped. It started again at 6am. Omg.    We loved the small feel (compared to other hotels) and the boutique part of the hotel with awesome bar was fantastic. We would stay here again just ask they don’t put us next to animal!
20,This was our first time staying at the MGM Park hotel and only chose to do so as we were going to see Lady Gaga perform. ( she cancelled) .    On the night before we were to check in I received an email informing us that we could pre check in online. I attempted to do so but it kept saying it did not recognize our reservation. I received another email on the morning of check in so I tried once again with no success. At this point I decided to call the hotel to ensure their was no issue with our reservation. I made 4 attempts and was hung up on all four times. I gave up trying and decided to wait to get to the hotel.    When we arrived at the hotel by rental car we were met at valet by a very nice man but we then waited 15 minutes for a bell hop to come unload our vehicle. We went inside the hotel to be met by self service kiosks. Both myself and my friend tried to log in to our reservations and once again neither worked and we had to wait for help from a staff member. Our rooms were not ready and we had to walk around for an hour and a half at which point they texted us. I have no issue with the wait as check in was not until 3 and we were early. However once again when we returned to the hotel we had to go to the kiosks to get keys which again did not work and again we had to wait for assistance. It was truly the worst check in experience I have had at a hotel.    We went to our rooms and had to call down for our luggage. The phone in my friends room was not operational and she had to go down and find staff to get her luggage. i did call down and received luggage in about 15 minutes.    The rooms are basic and the decor very poorly done. My room was green with awful tacky pictures on the walls. My friends room was bright red with same pictures. The beds were extremely uncomfortable and the walls paper thin. Hallways are dark and and the whole place has the feel of a dated low end motel. The rooms were clean and the showers had a strong force.    The Casino itself is very dark and old. I don’t gamble so cannot comment otherwise.. There was a lack of restaurants and they were all extremely crowded.    I would never stay here again. I have stayed at many lower end hotels that I enjoyed due to wonderful helpful front desk staff. Hotels should be about service and in my opinion to attract repeat loyal customers you need to provide the human touch.    This is a first and last for me. There are too many wonderful hotels in Vegas to come back here. I have been visiting Vegas for years and this was the worst experience I have had.
10,I stayed in this hotel for a work trip. There is very little interaction with staff from the moment you enter the hotel. You just walk in and have to figure out how to use self checkin yourself. The rooms are nothing special and the rippled carpet in the common areas is way past its prime. The hotel's restaurants are VERY expensive and not worth it. Food quality is average. Don't buy anything in the gift shop. I picked up a bottle of water and a rasor and it was $36!!!!! I found that to be completely insulting. I understand the hotel needs to make a profit but come on! I would never stay there again!
30,Overall not a bad property. I think this property is a good alternative to the larger more contemporary properties like The Aria or Cosmopolitan. The recent remodel seemed to be focused on the the public areas (Casino's restaurants) and skimped on the rooms and hallways. With that said the quality of the mattress was very good and I enjoyed a comfortable night sleep. The bathrooms aren't fancy but are adequate clean and the water pressure in the shower was the best I've experienced. The color scheme is too dark especially in the hallways making the hallways appearing dark and dirty even if they aren't.
40,"room was comfortable quiet and had good room service. no coffee machine in the room. Missed the convenience of a coffee in am in the room. Had to go to restaurant/bar for coffee in the am.Good location on the strip. used the tram to Bellagio and walked on the strip. Used the Big Bus tour - very useful for surveying the casinos. Was disappointed in the Lady Gaga show ""Enigma"" - too loud could not hear Lady Gaga. would have like the jazz show better."
50,Just got back from a long weekend trip to Las Vegas and was very glad that I stayed at the Park. Rooms were nicely furnished the bathroom was clean and the shower was very nice. The pressure felt great on my tired back! I ate twice at Primrose and found that the food and service were outstanding. I have read reviews of the hotel and people have complained of a lack of a coffee pot.I have stayed at most of the hotels on the strip and none of them had coffee pots in the room.
10,Problems:  1. Minimal water pressure in the shower.  2. Only two very small drawers  3. Minimal closet space with only 4 hangers.  4. Dangerous closet door if someone is using the bathroom at the same time.  5. We thought there might be more water pressure at the shower at the pool. There wasn't. thanks
40,The Park MGM is gorgeous. They have done a great job with the remodeling and the ambient is fresh. I didn't get to enjoy the facilities as much due to business but the room was very clean smell great and the bed was very comfortable. You walk in and do check in on your own and check out as well. I also didn't get to use the room service I don't think there was anyhow nor dine at the restaurants but other than that is very chick. I did enjoy some pizza at eataly marketplace food was great a little overprice but good food and wine.
30,We booked at the Park MGM because we had tickets to a concert there. Check in and check out were automated and in keeping with the impersonal atmosphere of the hotel . The tram to the Belagio thru the Aria was convenient to get to the strip. The ETALY deli/restaurant presented many different meal choices but unfortunately seating was at a premium. The room had no fridge nor coffee machine and the lobby Starbuck's closed at 22:00hrs daily. There is a 24 hour Starbuck's at the Belagio. To my mind it is obvious that management discourages anyone staying in their room as this would require usage of room service. Each morning involved getting dressed and going down to the lobby to get a morning cup of coffee in a lineup that sometimes lasts over 20 minutes.
40,The rooms and bathrooms were exceptionally clean and beds and pillows were comfortable. The shower was AMAZING! The only weird thing was the décor and color scheme. Our room had a green accent to it. The couch chair couch pillows and blinds were all different shades of 70's green.
40,Stayed at Park MGM for Lady GaGa Jazz & Piano concert. Check-in was simple using kiosk however you do not get to choose your room location and when entering allocated room opposite the T-Mobile arena we were met with loud music. Being light sleepers we requested change of room to quieter location which was promptly attended to by the staff with no issues. Room itself is of good size clean bed very comfortable and walk in shower large & great water pressure. As with other reviews we found that the walls didn't contain noises from the neighboring rooms but a call to the front desk quickly had security request neighbor to turn their blaring TV down about 4am. Found the location of Park MGM well suited to our needs and the free mono-rail between Park MGM <->Aria <-> Bellagio was very handy. Check-Out process also very simple...check out from room cellphone or kiosk. Overall had a very good stay and would recommend.
40,The room was very comfortable and clean. There was a nice pop of color and tasteful décor. Enjoyed the variety of restaurants you can choose from on property and more places in walking distance. The check-in/check-out was super easy and no waiting in lines.
40,Centrally located priced right cozy renovated modern rooms a decent amount of eating choices the casino was well ventilated and our experience was overall very pleasant...I would definitely return
30,Stayed in a suite with friends for a weekend and I have to say... I’m not impressed. Check in was slow they had some sort of issue getting us checked in. The room was okay nothing special and a personal peeve of mine was the no fan in the bathroom. The hotel has some decent food options and your standard casino. Easy to find and drop off/pick up areas were clean and well organized so you don’t have long wait times.
30,The hotel looks beautiful. Eataly food court really nice. However room still a problem. They finally added a tall dresser but put it in the clothes closet. It takes half the space where you can hang your clothes. The clothes you are hanging are in front of the vault - makes it a pain to go in and out of the vault. Still really dislike the sliding door for closet to the bathroom. And many people slam this door and you can hear it in your room. Would much prefer a dresser in the room not the closet.
40,Park MGM (previously known as the Monte Carlo) is a great place to stay. The rooms are warm and inviting and the added food experience of an Italian inspired marketplace called EATALY makes this a fun & hip place to stay. The sports book feels more like a bar from home and the opportunity to listen to a live band while playing the slots creates a party like environment. We will stay here again!
50,"The variety and the quality was worth the walk the the Park MGM. From apps to desserts ... best ""quick"" food on the strip. Make sure you look at all the stands before you decide ... I missed a row and not that I was disappointed with my selection I just didn't know was more! Don't forget the desserts ... the best ""donuts"" (don't know the Italian word for the pastry)."
20,"Did not change the sheets out for three weeks of my stay. I didn't notice at first then I realized they had the same coffee stain on the corner that happened the first week of my stay. Unsanitary.  Water was cut off over night on more than one occasion could not shower.    Rooms are very dusty. I had to change rooms when I first checked in due to the room being dirty and big brown stains on the lampshade. The ""self"" check in process is not efficient/frequently doesn't work and creates huge lines at the vip counter.  The room decor is cute but amenities are minimal and hotel seems understaffed."
50,We went on a Friday night to see lady Gaga and these people know what they are doing. The staff are all well organized and guide you to the proper doors. Security was friendly and informative. Bar staff were great even the bathroom attendant complimented my outfit! The theatre was great I didn’t see a bad seat in the house! And Gaga was as amazing!
50,"MGM is not just satisfied with Making Movies. They know the ""Real"" payoff is Legalized Gaming in the State of Nevada. I mean any idiot can take just $20 and throw into a machine that might pay you $5 back. Multiply that $20 times the 39-40 MILLION people that visit Las Vegas (A dip) every year. This Hotel really has their act together. You check in  receive your keys and check out using an ATM like machine. Of of course it is personal with a blond lady saying all sorts of encouraging words. NO! Not those! LOL...We paid extra for a ""View"" but I didn't see anything but a wall outside. I walked to the stairwell and had a wondrous view of everything south of Tropicana blvd So don't fall for that one. The rooms were especially quiet abet my cousin snoring all night. thank goodness I was so tired I fell right to sleep. One thing I don't like in these Hotels is these dumb shower curtains!!! I love the one Hotel that has a ""Walk-in"" shower! I mean I'm not a kid do I need a tub to fall down getting into? We did not eat there and check out was I believe 11 or 10 am. all the staff was very polite and helpful. I cannot get over that MGM has Four resorts now! We paid $127 for the room on a corporate account so negotiate! I would recommend this hotel ove the many other sleaze bag ones in Las Vegas..."
10,We stayed in park mgm for 2 nights. My personal belongings got stolen either in lobby or hotel room. There is a very serious security issue in park mgm.    In addition we emails and confirmed we could have $90 credits to spend during our stay. However during checkout the machine did not deduct the credits. We have to line up at the front desk in order to deduct the credits. The staff at the frontline was unhelpful and told us we were entitiled to $60 credits instead of $90. We showed her the email she told us that she is not sure if that email is from park mgm. That was ridiculous! It was from guest service park mgm.    Feel free to stay in park mgm if you wish to be robbed!
50,Music everywhere you walk! Excellent location close to the best places to visit right on the strip. Decorated with a touch of French country style beautiful parks and the Spa is a must do. Warm service and very friendly people. This for me was the best hotel in Vegas for a lot of reasons. Eataly market is amazing and delicious. Mimosas at Primrose the best. Very Romantic and classy.
50,Just wanted to give a shout out to Chela our pool hostess. The service was simply outstanding. Chela did not only endure all our needs were totally met she also assisted in looking for shows places to eat and great things to see in Vegas. It made for 2 really enjoyable days. Way to go Chela!!!
50,Couldnt have been happier. I'll start with the staff  from check in staff bartenderswaiter in Primroseand housekeeping .... they went above and beyond being nice and helpful. The rooms were nice clean and the bed was comfortable. Casino wasnt sardine packed like others on the strip. Nice selection of restaurants and the quality of food was excellent!
50,Stayed at park mgm because we had tickets to Lady Gaga on Halloween night. Location is great and the park hotel has a very nice vibe. Bar drinks are expensive. Had chicken at the crack shack which was fabulous. Etaly has wide selection of foods. Will stay at Park again
30,Hotel check in was a bit different... staff that was there to 'help' not so helpful - a bit rude and abrupt. I like the concept but if you're going to take away the 'human' element need to make sure you provide helpful friendly staff! When walking to the Aria (inside walkway) hotel the SMELL was Horrendous! Smelled like sewage! Made the walk quite often and the smell was bad EVERY time.
20,The check in and people were very friendly. However once we got to our room the room was dirty with crumbs food new clothes tags and a pen laying in the chair that was at the table. I complained a total of 3 times and apparently housekeeping came to clean the room. The mess was never cleaned and I was extremely disappointed.
30,Close to the hockey arena and a bit calmer than most casinos... Eataly is one of the great places to visit and enjoy a wonderful Italian meal.... The Nutella Crepes are the best! The concept allows the putchase of a vast array of Italian food stuffs!
50,Our overall experience at the Park MGM was fantastic. The valet service was excellent. The staff servicing our room was excellent. The food was excellent. Two suggestions: 1) We had a strip room view which was great except for one thing - there was only one chair that you could use to face the window and enjoy the view. Add an extra chair. 2) Hire staff for the check in and check out process - self check in should be an option not a requirement. It was an awful experience especially after traveling all day.
10,Had a room issue they blamed me even after a staff member confirmed the issue. They barely made an accommodation and didn't offer anything. you obviously have to be a high roller to get any respect from them.
50,The location is perfect the service. And cleanliness was also perfect.about the room I was offered a suite but only could get a room. Still good considering that all 5 nights were comped. Value on the food not good for the price. 32 ounce porterhouse steak $130 plus $18 for a baked potato. Other then the food cost it’s an excellent hotel in every way including drinks delivered at tables and slots.
20,The hotel lack any kind of flare or something to attract you go back. The decor is frankly random and weird and reminds me of someone decorating and furnishing the place from yard sales. If that is your thing than this is your kind pf place. They need to get rid of the stupid resort and parking fees and make the price reflect the just average hotel. Location is good especially if seeing something at either the T-Mobile or Park Theater
40,Stayed here for concert on Halloween.  Great property  Heard way too much conversation from room next door. In need of better sound proofing. Lots to see and do in this property. Great location and staff services.
40,Great accommodations and Restaurants. Casino floor was a bit too smokey so I had a sore throat for part of the trip. Highly recommend Eataly and Crack Shack for a great meal with great service. Would definitely return.
10,Room we reserved and prepaid for was not available upon checkin. They got us an inferior room starting a chain reaction of bad thing. Clogged tub water shutoff at night terrible neighbors 2 of the 3 night. Hotel staff willingness to address issues seemed lacking. Will not be recommending Park MGM
40,I had a great time here the only bad thing is the hallways to your room is very dark you can not see out the peep hole because it is so dark in the hallway. The shower is great even on the 26 floor hot water right away .
40,Very clean hotel nice location as with almost every hotel I went into in Vegas it smells horribly of smoke check in is chaotic as with all of these hotels price is okay rooms are pretty basic lobby is nice but not extravagant like some of the other hotels on the strip
50,Great Hotel - Perfect location to easily walk tram or Uber anywhere eon the strip. The dining options were also very good - multiple types/cuisines to make everyone happy. The hotel/casino was never too crowded or crazy
50,Great food court called Eataly lots to chose from little pricey for drinks but understandable for the neighborhood. Banquet room for our conference was modest but functional great food service good acoustics nice staff
40,"Our tour group stayed here for the last night of our tour.....very nice room although we missed a clock. No chance of seeing that in Las Vegas!!!!    The rooms are nicely appointed but done in either a red or green motif...........thank goodness that our room was a green-appointed one! I saw the ""red room"" and it was much too Vegas for us.    Whatever you do do NOT touch your in-bar unless you are willing to spend MUCHO dollars for bottled water candies etc.!!!!!!!!!    We had a staff member arrive to our room to assess our in-bar inventory. If you remove the items from that area for 30 SECONDS or more you will be charged for those items!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    BEWARE.........you are in Las Vegas!!!!!!!!"
50,Had a great time staying at Park MGM. Excellent service intimate setting great location for getting around the strip. M Life Military and Veteran program has excellent benefits and recommend to sign up if you are eligible. Only down fall to the room is no fridge (is offered for fee) otherwise will not hesitate to stay here again.
20,We used to stay at what was the Monte Carlo and is now the Park MGM. I expected to see some amazing reservations however we were sorely disappointed. The rooms are horrible. There are no dressers so expect to live out of a suitcase. There was a bathtub the size of a NYC studio apt instead of a normal walk in shower. The decor is beyond tacky and they will nickel and dime you for just asking for a refrigerator even if you need it for medication. 35 dollars a day for a fridge! MGM really did a poor job with Park and I would seriously consider staying at another property before this one.
20,Stayed here since we came to see Lady Gaga. The rooms were loud being able to hear my neighboring room's occupants full conversations. The check in process was flawed receiving room keys with no room number. Dining options are sparse in the daytime and overpriced for the portion sizes. If I had to do it all over again I'd have stayed at the Cosmopolitan as I usually do when I come to Vegas.
40,I paid $850.00 for three nights for two guests. I thought that was a bit expensive and could have a found a better deal elsewhere but the other party with us booked here so we also stayed at Park MGM.
50,This was a great hotel on the strip. It’s not located on the busiest part of the strip but not too far of a walk. The Eataly inside the hotel was excellent. Check-in was so easy. The pool was a decent size not too small. Unfortunately for us it was too cold to go in (low 60s). I really loved that their casino didn’t have that old cigarette smoke smell like the older hotel do.
50,I've had 3 trips to the Park MGM this year The hotel is very clean beds are fabulous. It is a place I am comfortable going to on my own. The Park Theater is accessible right off the casino floor ideal when you want to see a show that your friends are not interested in.
50,This recently renewed hotel is so gorgeous. Conectes to a tram that takes you to other hotels which made it easy for us to move around the strip.  The room is very beautiful contemporary and clean which to me is the most important thing.  The service is outstanding! And the check in and Check out is the easiest I’ve never experienced. Excellent bars too. Love it
10,Nice location near Eatlaly! But the hotel by it self is outdated! The hallway looks like a jail... black doors and dark carpet . The room is super outdated... a renovation is mandatory for the money u pay!
30,I actually enjoyed our stay here at the ParkMGM but gave it 3 stars due to the complicated check in process.    There are multiple reviews that mention the check in process and it doesn’t seem to get any better.    The day before our stay we received an email to check in and then receive a QR code to use when we arrive. We never got the code and upon arrival waited in line to use a kiosk to check in. We were unable to complete the check in and waited for someone to assist us. This person was not helpful and provided little assistance. Funny thing is we were not the only ones having issues..after finally checking in we were told our room was not ready even though it was 2 hours after check in time. We were instructed to go to the VIP line for assistance. There we were behind at least 10 other people waiting to be helped with one young lady at the counter. I mean this is ridiculous. And then the 37.00 resort fee on this type of service??? Unacceptable!    We stayed 3 nights and every time we went through the lobby we witnessed the same type of problems with the check in process.    It’s a convenient place to stay if you’re attending a concert at the Park Theater. Eately the Italian marketplace and a few of the other restaurants in the hotel are good.    Rooms were decent sized and clean.    Check in is horrible.
50,Through MLife we got 3 free nights for our stay. We have stayed here before and knew what to expect from our experience. It was the same as the last time. Rooms are great staff is very friendly when you do need to interact with them.
50,I loved my recent stay at Park MGM. My room was ready at check-in and check-in process was fast and efficient at the kiosk. My room was clean and modern perfect for my overnight stay. The property is fun a lot of new restaurants and the club On the Record was a blast. I highly recommend this property. It is one of the newest places on the strip give it a chance and check it out! Also it is the perfect location on the strip there is a tram connected to the property that can take you to Bellagio and the Shops at Crystals
50,The overall rate for me was excellent! I would really be coming back again to this hotel/ casino. Great staff!!! I will recommend this place to my friends family and co workers! So pleased with admitting desk because they accommodated our request for my sister and me to be on the same floor and nearby room to be near each other.
30,Check in went fast but confusion and how to get comps included with the stay. Waitresses were slow w drinks. Very tight machines. Very close to stadium so loud when there is a game going on. Beds were uncomfortable.
40,If you are going to Las Vegas for an event at the T-Mobile Arena this is the place to stay. The hotel is literally across from the arena. It is also conveniently located on the Strip and within walking distance of all the attractions. Check-in was a bit of a hassle with the self-serve kiosks but I was able to get staff to help me out. My king bed was comfortable but it looked like the room hadn’t been dusted in a few days. A little bit more attention by housekeeping would have been nice. The walls are also very thin in this hotel as I could hear my neighbour talking all through the night. Ear plugs are a must if you are a light sleeper. All in all I had a great stay at the Park and definitely would recommend this hotel to others.
10,Huge party in the room next to ours loud music banging on the walls screaming. Kept us up all night. Called front desk three times they did nothing more than ask the people to be quiet which didn’t work. Front desk said they’d kick the people out but they didn’t do that either. They didn’t move our room didn’t even seem to care.
20,Rooms need coffee pots and better beds after three nights trying to sleep in the bed I used all the puffy pillows to sleep on the 4th night because my hips hurt so bad...oh and pillows are way to big with the 4 pillows on each bed you need to put a couple that aren't so BIG. The hallways need brighter lights and the casino really needs less expensive meal options. We had little to no interaction with any staff but we did enjoy the size of the casino because you can't get lost in it.
50,Great location on the strip and a good size — not humongous like some other strip hotels. Nice variety of food options and short walk to NYNY for more choices from another MGM property. Self-parking has easy access to hotel without too long a walk. Tram to ARIA and Bellagio was nice feature.
30,Second time staying here and probably last we usually stayed at the Aria. We came here again since our first stayed was really nice not this time. Called the front desk since our security safebox was not working (never got resolved) it just felt different.
40,I had a few issues with communications between the hotel regarding room accommodations and requests for cleaning services. The operations here are a bit mismanaged and did not meet my expectations for an MGM property.
50,Great location for sporting events and concerts. The tram makes it easy to get to the rest of the strip. Ride share and shuttle/taxi area is well organized and efficient. The staff was courteous and were always smiling.
20,"I was in town at a conference and this hotel was a recommended hotel partner by the conference. While the hotel itself was nice enough no one warned me about a planned party from 11PM-3AM. When I finally called at midnight to see what time the noise would end the front desk told me I should have been warned at check-in in case I wanted to change rooms as the party didn't end until 3AM. I had my alarm set for 3:30AM to catch a 6:30 flight and only got an hour of sleep. To ""compensate"" me they offered me one night's resort fee of $40. I had to catch my flight so I didn't have time to argue but this isn't the kind of service I would have expected. I get that this is Vegas but if you're going to offer yourself as a business destination for a conference you need to expect that people who are working will need to sleep."
20,"Poor sound-proofing in rooms make for bad experience if facing the strip due to ""off-the-record"" club being so loud sound travelled up to 22nd floor and made sleep impossible. There is no roof on the club which is why the sound travels like that. I complained to front desk but nothing was done nor any suggestions made. They simply sympathized with me which was nice but didn't allow me to sleep any better."
50,I will continue to come to Park Hotel and Casino since location is very convenient and their amenities are just right for me. I really appreciate a comfortable and clean room after a hard day of work and I have it here. Thank you.
50,We had a great stay. Our room was lovely. Check in was a breeze. The Casino staff was very friendly. Room service was great and delivered very quickly. We had lots of  choices for food. Access directly to Park  Theater. I’ll definitely will be back.
10,Will never stay at this dump again. Adjoining room door was paper thin barking dog in adjoins room. Room is dated needs upgrade. Overpriced should be $50/ night. Resort fee? Really? For what? No water middle of the night. On and on an on.
30,I am mostly outraged at the $41/night “resort fee.” Nobody could actually explain to me why I paid an extra $123 for my 3 night stay. The pool closed at 6pm aside from the casino which had only expensive tables at all hours of the day I’m not sure what the resort fees go toward. We got in at 1am and still had to wait 20 minutes to check in because their kiosks were down and couldn’t get a room next to our friends which I had requested a month prior. I was told “yea no problem just ask them when you check in.” Not only were we not next to them we couldn’t even take the same elevator up. Didn’t have a bathrobe or slippers or any of the other things I would associate with a “resort.” Other than that obnoxious fee it was a pretty bland hotel $20 cover to their nightclub even if you’re staying there so we didn’t make it.
50,I have stayed in hotels in Vegas over 20+ times. Park MGM has the most comfortable beds on and off the strip. The pool is beatiful and the bartender at the pool Chuck can make the biggest and best bloody mary in town!
40,Beautiful Hotel/Casino. The Hotel requires guests to check in and out using Kiosk(s) located in Lobby. Checking in was no problem but checking out was. To checkout you are prompted to enter certain information including your floor number. I entered the requested information several times but the system would not accept it. There are no instructions and when I called for assistence I waited 10 minutes before leaving. I later learned the you have to enter the floor number as 07 instead of 7. I found this frustrating and without help a waste of time.
20,The automated check-in process was cold and impersonal. We'd booked a King room but were given a different room type. There was no way to address the problem on the kiosk and the woman overseeing the process was not able to help either.    The location is good - near a lot of restaurants and the Park theater which is convenient if you're in town for a show.
40,Nice location clean room great bed & pillows not thrilled with the poolside service or automated check in. Right next door to the Vegas Knights arena and a nice little park area. Loved the variety of shops in Eataly.
50,Just finished a three night stay at the Park MGM and as always we had an awesome time. Staff are very friendly the casino is great and it's centrally located on the strip.  The new Italian food section is great very friendly people.
40,"The facilities are good -- not as good as some of the more expensive hotels on the Strip but better than the older hotels on the Strip. If you stay here you should eat at their Eataly marketplace (a high-end ""food court"") at least once. The check-in process was a bit frustrating though as their automated kiosks weren't good; but I'm pretty sure that will be fixed eventually."
40,We opted to stay at this resort because we had tickets to see their headliner Lady Gaga and knew it would be convenient. This was the former Monte Carlo which had been updated and refurbished. Most basic things about being at a resort have taken a step away from a personal touch to being on line and downloadable. We never had an opportunity to speak with a staff member (who looked more than willing to help us) because we were automatically and electronically pushed along!!!
50,This was our 26 year anniversary we came to rest as well because we are trying to start two businesses that we are so excited about and feel really great we came to this Hotel to rest and relax before we have to run for or business.
20,No running water in my room on my last night after working a 15 hour day managing AV crews and loading trucks and all I wanted was to take a shower and get some sleep after finally finishing work at 12:30am and getting to my room at 1 am. Check in and check process is awful. The rooms seem dingy and old. Bug bites from the bed............. it goes on.
50,Celebrating a birthday getaway weekend with my daughters. The Park MGM was a perfect choice for location quality of rooms and friendly staff. We celebrated by seeing Lady Gaga's Jazz performance in the Park Theater. Great seats for an amazing show!
50,This is my second stay at Park MGM. I traveled to Vegas for a work conference and I love the value I receive at Park MGM. The location of the resort is very important to me as well and at Park MGM I feel I am close enough to walk or calling an uber is very convenient.
30,we arrived the sink was not clean  the sofa by the window had hair on it  restuarants were above average gambling was not customer friendly meaning the machines dont pay out  just saying. overall average stay
40,Enjoyed my stay even though the room was dirty and check in was a hassle. I don't really have much else to say about the hotel and detest writing long reviews when they won't change anything with at least another 50 complaints.
50,Park mgm is in the perfect location for accessing anything on the strip! Friendly staff good layout clean nicely appointed rooms. They have some wonderful places to eat as well. Always a great value!
40,Very nice and clean resort. The only sub par area was the check-in. It was very informal and impersonal. There was alot of machines not working so it was frustrating. Over all an excellent resort with friendly staff.
50,This is the second time I stayed at Park MGM and it was even better than the first time. Finally went to Best Friend bar and it was awesome. The room was great as usual and The casino is just the right size.
10,My check in was horrible. The standard rooms are hideous. The shower and toilet kept backing up.    Was supposed to live to another room. I had to call at the end of the day like 12 hours after I began work to see why instill didn’t have a room. Check out kiosk also didn’t work!
50,Stayed for 5 nights! Great location and a great price! Loved the restaurants ate at La La Noodles Eataly and PrimRose. The tram was very convenient to get to Aria and Ballagio. Would stay there again.
50,Been to Vegas a few times but with the MyVEGAS app I earned points to get a two night stay for FREE! Only had to pay the resort fees which we knew about ahead of time. We were expecting a bad room with a less than stellar view since it was a free comp room. However to our amazement the room was stellar! Beautiful room impeccable cleanliness and the view was to die for! Upon checking in with the self-service kiosks I was having an issue with it reading my ID. Before I could ask for help a customer service rep was right there to assist me! The casino was also great! It felt like a smaller casino but with great variety and price points. Hands down will stay here again!
10,This is my second time staying here and I don’t get how a newly renovated hotel missed the mark. The walls are so thin you can hear the shades being opened. Front desk Dining and housekeeping were below average.
20,From having to check myself in to having to serve myself in ‘Eataly’ at resort prices and every promoter wants tips but their only job was to take my order I just felt that customer service was not provided.
10,"To say that this property is ""dated"" is an understatement. Was wood trim coming loose in the elevator on my way up to the room. The whole property was warn and distasteful. The room was so old and ""cheesy"" it's probably the worst hotel I've stayed in that I can recall in recent memory. There's no customer service you check in with a kiosk. An incredible rip-off for the price I paid."
20,The self service check in is the only option at this property. It is an awful process. Staff just stands there while you struggle and are unsuccessful in even getting a room. I booked a king room didn’t get it and nobody helped.
30,we upgraded to a stay well room as hoped it would be more sound proof (after reading several reviews). It was very peaceful and we thought we had solved the problem until of course we realized that the club On the Record had not actually been open until our last night. Things changed....I am good sleeper especially once asleep with some white noise from the AC and the air purifier but the DJ woke me right up around 1am. I tried to contact staff but unless I was prepared to go get dressed and look for someone it seemed a no go (no answer on the phone text or email). Just as well I suppose as I was not prepared to pack everything up to change rooms when we were checking out the next morning. I followed up in the morning explaining we had paid to upgrade to get a more peaceful night and had the opposite experience. The desk seemed unsurprised except to say that the guests are usually warned about the club when the room is assigned (presumably if you talk to someone as we did (we did not use the self-check in). They waived resort fees for the last night which while was nice was not enough to make me ever stay there again. Other than that the room was okay. Clean for sure. One set of drawers in eth closet and a shelf to use above the clothing rack but very minimal. The whole place is very self serve - no one to open doors when you are struggling in with bags no one interested in taking your bags and no security at the elevators. As an aside I still love what is in Park I would just never stay there again due to the problem with the noise. It was convenient for Bruno Mars which is why we left our usual go-to (Aria or Vdara so still MGM)...the price difference between our usual and Park was reflected in the change but the putting all else aside I can’t get past the noise). Summary - stay if you can get a room that won't be noisy and are looking a hotel in that price range. If not still visit all the great things Park has to offer but stay elsewhere - we're back at Vdara this coming January
30,Check-in Kiosk is glitchy but they do provide some help. Not really busy this week but several were late getting into rooms. Rooms are ordinary with no amenities (maybe soap and shampoo) but bed is comfortable. A/C is also glitchy as temperature will vary greatly depending on the time of day. Nice dining options nearby but all are pricey.....the re-do has upgraded the clientele which I appreciate greatly but many of the things I liked about the Monte Carlo were obliterated. Check out kiosk was not functioning when I departed early and no one there to help.
40,I love the Park MGM; I've made it a point over the years to try and stay at a different hotel every year - but I also make it a point to spend at least part of my stay at the Park MGM (fka The Monte Carlo) each year. I miss their buffet but at least they replaced it with some top notch restaurants.
30,Very basic hotel with limited amenities. Room was large and mostly clean but no fridge no alarm clock no coffee maker etc. Furniture was dusty. Limited dining options. Lobby & rooms are a bit of a walk from the strip. A lot of street noise even on 9th floor.
20,This place lacks of understanding about what customer service really is. Customer service was non existing they just don't care about you. Rooms were dated non well kept. Bathroom dirty Sofa was ripped and broken AC
50,Check in was easy. You need to use your room key to go up the elevator and select your floor level. It can be difficult when you can’t scan your key fast enough after the are multiple people in the elevator scan their key. We almost missed our floor. It’s great safety feature but difficult at times. The place is clean very nice and many places to sit down and relax. The only downfall was finding out the rooms are not cleaned on a daily basis unless it is requested.
50,Excellent service extremely clean rooms and fun night life for all ages. The new Eataly was a great spot for an afternoon snack meal and/or drink! We had coffee delivered every morning to get our morning started and services was supreme!!
10,It was a terrible check in process. It is a bad experience and then having to deal with getting double charged the next day with multiple employees the next day was annoying. It was not a good first impression.
50,Stayed at Park MGM again. Love the vibe of this hotel. Will stay here again. It’s not to far from everything either. The rooms are really nice. Beds are firm just the way I like it. Hopefully combing back to Vegas soon.
40,Just attended the Lady Gaga Enigma concert here and WOW what a great theatre from the acoustics to the stage and the seating cannot recommend enough. Eataly however within the venue is a very expensive place to grab a bite. Small portions at all areas and not worth the money. Go for the entertainment but eat somewhere else.
40,Price was good. Room was dusty. You can tell the rooms were older still. Nice appearance in lobby. Offered good restaurant options and Entertainment. Check out and in was easy online. Restaurant pricing could be more affordable. Maybe offer rooms according to stay type preference for people with all common interest.
50,We loved our stay at The Park MGM for a long weekend! Hotel was quaint compared to the others on the strip. Our room was quiet spacious and comfortable. Restaurants in the hotel were excellent and the Lady GAGA jazz concert in the Park theatre right in the hotel was beyond expectations! We highly recommend everything there!
30,After arriving at the hotel you are not greeted by a front desk with any type of customer service. When. You enter the door you are greeted by a chaotic self check in area where you must fend for yourself. This hotel has been recently remodeled but looks like it was done in a hurry as many little items were missed. The restaurants were nothing to brag about but the location is great if you want to stay on the strip.
50,Great place to stay! Location is one of the best in Las Vegas. LaLaNoodles is outstanding our favorite place to eat (good food-excellent customer service! Casino is nice. Park Theatre is a perfect venue for concerts. Every seat is good!
40,Overall great place and experience. Staff were friendly and helpful. Room was clean and hotel was easy to navigate. Lots of places to eat and lots of entertainment within  walking distance. Transportation was easy to get when needed.
40,Great location on strip and very close to other mlife properties. Great casino layout with a good selection of restaurants. Helpful staff but would still like to see a person for check ins. Overall it was a great experience.
30,"Pros:  -Proximity to Park Theater  -Lots of good food options at Eataly  Cons:  -'Renovated"" rooms had some furniture pieces (table leather chair) that appeared to have been carried over from the old Monte Carlo days"
50,I saw some complaints about check in. It was very easy. We just need to get used to self service. It was simple and quick. I also was approached by a service person asking if I was checking in ok. Staff was lovely. Rooms are clean and spacious.
50,Had a wonderful time - Hotel is close to everything. Shows at the MGM are a blast. We saw Michael Jackson's One a must see and close to the MGM Park. Lady Gaga had a show at the Park -phenomenal show as well as small museum of her outfits were great.
50,Beautiful rooms outstanding location and excellent service. Looking forward to returning in the future. A pleasant surprise! Although maybe not on a Saturday when the rates in the city are at their highest
20,renovated but still very dated. gaming room is so small. there aren't many good restaurants in the hotel itself. rooms are not impressive at all you would expect more of a suite. It's like a room with a couch one from the 80's. when staff cleaned room only thing that they did was make the beds. they didn't take out any old cups or glasses. location is ok. There are way better hotels on the strip.
20,Was expecting more out of this hotel. We booked it for a birthday weekend and from the moment we got there it was a bit chaotic. The location is great and the casino is great but the overall hotel operations side of the house could use some work.
50,Fun 3 day visit with family with sunny weather. The Park MGM location was perfect near the arena casinos shopping and the strip...great overpasses eliminating street crossings. The hotel was clean and the staff was courteous and friendly.
30,The new Park MGM is in a good location and was an OK stay.  Pros: Location the rooms have towel and clothing hooks on the wall TV/cable was good very clean and fresh look shower water pressure excellent    Cons: Everything is SO green. Forced to use automated check in process that's confusing and wasn't even working properly. Bathroom door shared with closet door so going back and forth is a pain to keep moving it.
40,"The new remodel at Park MGM is finally finished and it's a huge improvement! ""Eataly"" is a huge retail/food area with an amazing choice of meat fish charcuterie and desserts and there are plenty of coffee options - something that was lacking in the past. Will stay again."
50,Excellent time at MGM. Thank you for providing an excellent experience with great people. we gambled a lot and despite losing over $1000 on blackjack and craps I had a great time and enjoyed interacting with all the staff members.
20,Check in was a nightmare. They double charged my room for the full amount. It was recitified but it shouldn't of happend. I was expecting a nicer room. no amenities in the room. no refrigerator glasses coffee etc. The shower leaked all over the floor.
30,Decent. Clean. Room was good. Doesn't smell like cigarette smoke like many hotels in Las Vegas. Breakfast restaurant was poorly run. Long wait in spite of many empty tables. Eataly food court was very good.
30,The rooms do not have fridges and if you want one they charge $35 per day. You will also pay a $40+ resort fee and $24 to park. Oh and Starbucks is 50% more than a regular SB. Vegas has gotten ridiculous.
30,These Vegas hotels are huge and impersonal. This one is so vast you can walk miles from one end to the other. And the big shock for us is that smoking is permitted in the casinos (to encourage punters to stay put and spend money). We didn't want to spend time in the casinos (we were there for a concert) but you have to walk through the casinos to get to the restaraunts.  Rooms were huge and good sized bathrooms. Excellent showers with plenty of water pressure.  Staff were efficient but not particularly friendly. And why have automated check-in when you need staff to explain it and make any special requests? Just makes the place seem even colder.  No real positives or negatives.
30,Positives- Great restaurants especially Lala Noodle and Eataly Italian food area both were delicious. Staff at Lala Noodle were super friendly. The Park theater and Gaga were amazing super great show at a nice venue.  Negative-Hotel is dark and the smoke smell was awful. I didn’t realize how bad and dark the hotel was until I went the The Mirage for a show and it smelled good and was brighter and happy...rooms at Park are dated but bathroom was updated. The hallway to my room was like the Shining movie.  Park is a great place to eat and see a show in the theater but I’ll stay at the Mirage next time.
30,We stayed 2 nights Friday & Saturday (Oct 25-26). We never received housekeeping services. We did not hang a privacy sign outside our door anytime during our stay. We called the front desk and housekeeping from the hotel room phone and each time were promised someone would be up NO ONE ever came. It would have been nice to have fresh sheets on the bed and clean towels (only enough clean towels hand towels face clothes for 2 people foe one night). We even caught a security employee walking in the hall and mentioned this to her and she radioed someone but again...NOTHING. Get your act together too many hotel choices to put up with this. We come often and will stay somewhere else in the future. Oh and the bed if you like sleeping on what feels like a slab of concrete after about 15 minutes your in luck with this hotel.
30,Nice room but no coffee pot and retail stores over the top expensive. $11.00 for 2 bottles of water. The casino is very smoky as a non-smoker I don’t want to smell like one. Check in wasn’t successful despite having reservation number.
50,This hotel since it was re-done to become the Pagk MGM has become the best of both worlds in LV it is centrally located to all has great restaurants and they've added EATALY which is a great food and drink area not stuffy and not too run of the mill. The hotels also features a great steak house with fantastic food the casino is not overwhelming just the right size and great service overall.
10,It took 7 people from maintenance VIP and management and over 7 hours to fix a simple toilet/sink slow drainage issue. I also called M Life for help; they actually helped and expedited the resolution. It should have taken less then 10 minutes to fix. Anyone at maintenance VIP and/or management could have just bring a plunger and fixed it. Simply they failed to communicate within their team/departments; failed to satisfy their client. Imagine if the toilet was over-flowing at the time we called. Oops! It would definitely have costed them much more.    Excellent customer service was definitely missing that day at Park MGM.
40,Very pleased with the Park MGM. The beds were comfortable and the large TV came in handy after an exhausting day. A variety of restaurants with diverse menu choices and excellent food. I think the service by all of the staff members was superb. We'll be back.
40,Hotel was clean and service was good. The automated check in took a bit of getting used to . But no mistakes on our room charges and friendly people . There pool seemed to have not much atmosphere and very quiet .
50,We spent 4 days here at Park MGM and had a wonderful stay. Lots of conveniences like restaurants casino and shows. Look forward to staying again in the near future. We will definitely share our experience with friends.
30,only location is good close to other casinos. Otherwise needs another revocation. no coffee maker no refrigerator. drink selection are very poor the slot machines pay off was very sad. cocktails too so long to bring drinks coffee service on paper cup at gaming table that was almost burnt my hand. Nothing exciting about the casino poor decoration and too dark.
50,This was the Monte Carlo once upon a time. I think they did a really nice job renovating the place and creating a very lively and hip environment. Loved the live music cover band on the casino floor by the tables Friday night! The beds are sooo comfy and the pillows were heavenly. Tons of places to eat and super chic bars and lounges to explore. We will definitely be back.
20,Great location for Knights game and nice casino but rooms are not very clean and walls are thin. Called to have room cleaned and when we returned the room had been spiffed up but the problems with cleanliness was not addressed.
30,Rooms were great and reasonable rates but food and drink charges were far too expensive. Parking and other fees are crazy also.Nice property and pool. They need to not nickle and dime their customers.
20,Hotel is nice (outside the rooms) but we had trouble with the a/c our restroom sink was backed up and the pillows were too big and uncomfortable to sleep with. The hotel is conveniently located to T-Mobile arena.
40,Our room was very clean which is always a big plus for me. We stayed to see Lady Gaga concert in this theater. It was great to have that convenience. Bed was very comfortable. Only a few cons - we had to pay for parking ($15/night) we could hear noise from outside in our 8th floor room until about 2:00 a.m. no coffee maker/fridge in room and meals at hotel are very expensive. We ate out to save money - fortunately there are many restaurants to choose from but it would be nice to have more affordable options at the hotel! Overall happy with room.
30,The reviews don’t lie. The check in process is awful. We waited 5hrs for our rooms. The staff wouldn’t give us a straight answer until management was involved. Otherwise decent location. Rooms were clean. Pool was relaxing.
30,I have to say we were disappointed with the ParkMGM. You check in by kiosk which for us had WiFi problems and our room cards did not come out of their machine. They had help that was nearby and took care of us but I wished we had our helper just check us in from the start! When we walked into our room we were surprised that the rooms were so small. The color scheme was surprising as well. The room blinds were either bright red or bright green. You use a metal bead pull loop to open and close them and that was surprisingly noisy in adjacent rooms. Walls were not sound proofed and normal conversation can be pretty clearly heard from the rooms you are next to! The closet door was like a barn door on rails which when shifted becomes the bathroom door. Unfortunately when it covers the bathroom opening it covers the opening but leaves a gap thus providing little sound privacy. The beds were made of very firm foam which caused my husband to develop bad hip/back pain that he has never had before!  The nice part about attending a conference there was that the conference area was a close walk from the elevators and all conference rooms were close together.  The staff were very nice and willing to help at all times.
20,Poorly appointed room no coffee maker no place to properly put your clothes such as a dresser. Very cheap appointments in the room. MOST IMPORTANT - be prepared to check yourself in on a computer system in the lobby. There is no registration desk.  You are paying MGM prices for a Motel 6 hotel.
10,This hotel is far from a 4 star hotel. The check-in was pretty fast however we were given a room which was not cleaned from previous stay. So we had to go back to the receptionist to change the room. She did not even say sorry for their mistake. The iron in the room was not working so we had to ask for another one. There was no hair dryer in the room and our room smelled like mold.
30,Beware when you book this hotel add another 15 dollars to the cost if you need to park.  Also all pools are mostly in the shade not great for early and late 9season  Eataly is amazing. Stay at another hotel and just go to eataly
40,After learning how to check-in under the PARK MGM system the rest was a breeze. The staff was very friendly and accomdating from start to finish. I wish there was a non-smoking area where you can gamble without coughing from the smoke. However I truly recommend this Hotel awesome time!
20,If your looking for Motel 6 you got it! Hotel lobby and casino are fine but step off the elevator heading to your room is another story...straight out of American Horror Story (the one with the hotel). It’s very dark (black/green halls and dark wallpaper) down the halls that lead to your room...very creepy. The rooms appear as if someone tried to make them vintage chic but they missed. For such a small space and tight hallways light inviting colors should be used. It would open up the space more and make it feel less creepy.
10,Food and Refreshments OVER PRICED No discounts when you stay in the Hotel valet Way Over Priced $ 24.00 per day...I don' know if this is the NEW VEGAS but if it is I will NEVER GO Back It was NO FUN and I'm from California …
30,Hidden fees and taxes plus obnoxiously over priced store items and restaurant prices made this trip much more expensive than originally planned. Plus your table game play will go unrated unless you buy in for hundreds at a time.
30,"Great location on the strip great proximity to the wonderful Eataly venue. Great self parking. Kludgy auto check in process. No personal touch per se from staff. All automated! Hallways to room very dark rather depressing for the ""bright light city"" .    Room purchased 3rd tier rate above base ""Stay Well Park MGM King"" with many healthy features. Found a basic motel level room very spartan with many ""sharper image"" gadgets throughout the room for air light shower management. nothing integrated. very clearly a low level makeover of the Monte Carlo with old chair and table from that style mixed in with the faux contemporary styling. Granted gadgets did work air was clean odor free shower pressure was great. but no fridge small cabinet for clothes very low ceilings random ""rotating"" artwork on walls.    One of two rooms apparently not finished upgrading had a tub rather than shower very unsafe to get into and out of. And the overhead lighting above table was run externally so the wire ran across the ceiling down the wall to the plug. Just a low level operation overall."
50,I had a great time a lot of comp good pool and rooms close to everything great service and food. bed we great and the shower had plenty of power. would stay her agin and will tell all my friend what a good time I Had thank you
20,You can do worse on the strip but not worth the $. Distracted customer service insufficient cleaning hard to find your way around. It's all fine but for the price and the posturing I expected one step higher than a motel.
30,While the location was good the service upon check-in was not really accommodating for the lateness of the room. Not even a drink while waiting. The room was an hour late. You would think the renovations would be a lot more fancier then was is there.
30,I realize that the focus of a Vegas hotel is to encourage one to spend time in the casino but the room should still be nice. Ours was drab and bare bones. The hallways are long and not well lit. We were missing typical things like a bath mat a luggage rack or equivalent drawers for clothing. To be fair I must say that the room was clean and the mattress was comfortable.
50,Just returned from a solo stay at Park MGM. Loved the location the room was well appointed and clean. Great shower and water pressure beds were very comfortable and loved the bench by the window! The casino was busy but lots of open machines great restaurants and loved the closeness to New York New York
10,There is NO check in staff - so you are on your own to find the elevators. I did find someone to ask and was given bad directions  The conceirge does not start until 8 AM so good luck askign where to find breakfast  Check again - you are on your own - I had to work hard to find a human  1 star - location is great and food options are great
30,This was my first time at Park MGM. It is a really nice property in the lobby etc. however I was disappointed that there was not a place to put your clothes underwear etc. in the room. Staff was friendly conference staff was excellent however (especially Matt).
30,Challenges with check-in (wrong room type provided) but once solved no issues. Busy hotel/casino. Food options fair/good. Great location on strip for access anywhere and especially for T-Mobile arena events.
30,Great location right at T Mobile loved the casino next door - New York New York hall ways very dark rooms very minimal but beds and linens nice key cards a problem in the rooms not enough chairs for the elderly to sit electronic check in only no desk for the elderly or others in need to be checked in.
50,A fun-filled 4 days. We enjoyed the entire experience at this hotel. Clean and comfortable rooms (loved the shower) friendly and accommodating staff and several good choices when one is hungry. Great location for taking in much of what Las Vegas offers.
40,Stayed at the park August 29 thru September 2. Room was nice size and cleaned daily large bathroom and safe in room but no fridge. Didn't hear any hall noise or noise from rooms next door.    Checked in at the kiosk and it was quick and easy and had a girl there to answer questions and help with the process.    The tram to belliago was nice and ran about every 10 minutes or maybe more. Much better than walking thru center city. Area is close to a lot of things and when construction in finished it will be much easier to navigate crossing the street. Also close to CVS in case you forget something    Loved the pool area and we were able to get a shady spot regardless of what time we got there which for Vegas heat is really nice also they had umbrellas.    I would recommend staying at the Park
50,I stayed at Park MGM hotel and it was a great experience. Clean and large rooms. A large Casino area available in the ground floor of the hotel. Overall its a fabulous experience staying at the Park MGM.
10,If you any desire at all to use the pool or spa area don’t stay at this hotel. Awful. Ridiculous policy on movement of lounge chairs. Funny sewage smell behind some decorative walls. Spa average at best. And no refrigerator in the room!!
50,My wife and I Just returned from a four night stay at the Park MGM. It was our first stay at the property and we really enjoyed it. The location can't be beat and we found the room to be simple but adequate. The shower had great pressure the bed was very comfortable and housekeeping was excellent. We did not have any issues with noises in the hallway or next door. We found the check-in kiosk to be very easy to use and intuitive. From the time we arrived we were on our way to our room in 5 minutes. We would definitely return.
40,"Park MGM is a big Las Vegas resort hotel. We were there for one night only to see Lady Gaga's show at the Park Theater at the hotel. The hotel was fine our room was fine (23-117) and the two restaurants we ate at (Crack Shack and Primrose) were very good and fairly reasonably priced by LV standards. The only part of the experience that we did not enjoy was check-in. We arrived from the airport about 3:30ish. Check in time is 3:00. The hotel now has check-in kiosks (like many airlines use - Southwest in particular) which prompt you for your name and checkout date (if I recall right). Well having a common last name apparently there were multiple Jones' checking out on the same day. So it asked for our confirmation number. Which I didn't have. Didn't think I needed to print out our reservation email. The check-in assistant (all of whom were very pleasant and helpful) found our reservation and told us our room wasn't ready but that we could check our bags with the bell captain and they'd text us when the room was ready which took what seemed to be about another 20-30 minutes or so. Then we had to go back to the kiosk put in our information have the assistant find our reservation again for the same reason and have our keys printed. Then back to the bell captain to get our bags and finally we could go to our room. Now we've travelled through a good part of the US and the world (Europe China Australia New Zealand Fiji Tanzania etc.) and in every hotel - big and small - where we checked in we were greeted by a smiling desk clerk who warmly welcomed us to their hostelry and seemed glad that we chose to stay with them. I understand that this is a huge hotel and having 10-12 kiosks keeps down personnel costs and can possibly check in more guests per hour so there are shorter lines etc. I get all that. But I found the experience cold and impersonal like they weren't especially glad that we chose to stay at their hotel. No warmth. No personal touch. Just touch the screen on our HAL 9000 check in computer and we'll read your credit card and spit out your room keys. I'm a tech savvy guy but I also value the personal touch when we travel. And Vegas is about nothing but the ""experience."" Anyway just my nickel's worth. BTW Lady Gaga's show was AMAZING!!"
50,Park MGM was the perfect hotel for business and pleasure. Guest room was very comfortable and conference rooms were made for business! The food during the conference was delicious and delicious restaurants were in walking distance.
30,Need somewhere to store clothes other than something the size of a nightstand. I would’ve like to have somewhere to put drinks to keeps the cold and keep food leftovers. For the cost of the room these and the bare minimum I would expect to have in a room. There was also loud pounding music every night that made I difficult to sleep. Hey f a club is going to be that close they either need to control the volume of music or the rooms need to be better insulated to control the pounding!
10,Not worth it! No coffee in room No fridge. They force you to use the 2 restaurants in the lobby that had an hour wait. The Starbucks was an hour each time too! The room was okay but bed was hard as a rock!
40,"I wasn't expecting a lot because of the reviews and the fact MGM practically gave me the room for nothing even though I am not a big gambler. There are a couple of baffling items in the room. The little shelf under the TV for one thing makes no sense at all. It's only about 5"" wide and basically useless except for wallets phones etc. There is lots of floor space and they easily could have added a small desk and chair and still been stylish about it. Another thing was that when the blinds in the adjacent suites are operated the chain sound is loud and clear. I actually awoke and jumped out of bed one night thinking someone was in my room. They could really use some dining options for before 5 pm as well other than Eataly. Thankfully plenty of options at NYNY.    Otherwise I really enjoyed my stay here. I was there for Aerosmith and there was classic rock everywhere. Elevators casino etc They even had a classic rock band nestled in between some slots featuring a guy who used to sing for Malmsteen and has performed in Raiding the Rock Vault.    The staff were all very friendly and helpful. The valet guys knew my name after 1 day.    The kiosks aren't as bad as people say. They are easier to figure out than a cell phone and folks seem OK with those. Don't click the Add self park option though. It automatically adds the cost whether you self park or valet and both show up on your bill. A quick trip to VIP desk got rid of that though."
20,Put us in the wrong room and didn’t change the next day. I had a health emergency and called for assistance and they said they would send someone immediately. I had to call three times because when I called back they said oh no one was told. I ended up being toyed out by ambulance because it took them so long to respond. Rooms are nasty dirty. No storage. Noisy staff were cold unresponsive. I would never stay in this sub par motel again.
50,We came to Las Vegas to see the lady Gaga Show. We are not big gamblers and wanted a place near the venue. Park MGM was a great choice. We booked a Nighthawk suite and loved the room. A king bed 2 couches 2 windows a large bathroom a huge closet and a big entry way with a space to store clothing.    The property is connected via Tram to Aria and Bellagio. New York New York is next door.    Three pools and plenty of dining options. We will be back for a future Raiders game and will not hesitate to book another stay here.    This is the site of the old Cosmopolitan. The remodel was a success. The concert venue was fantastic. We were just steps from our room to the Lady Gaga Show.    Download the M-Life App to assist with check-in and check-out. Minimal help at the front desk. Lots of kiosks to help with that process. Concierge was very helpful with dinner plans. We called ahead to book some tables.    Small gambling floor compared to the other casinos. That was fine with us.
30,Hotel lacks the basic 4-5 star features : Entry is awkward for guests coming in with more than 1 bag ; you simply cant open the doors as they are pull handle only with side ones requiring auto hand motion which defeats the purpose. Why would you not have simple open glass doors for ease convenience and freshness .    Most disappointing aspect was lack of front desk knowledge on internet wi-fi browser issues . You literally have to go through 10 people to get to an IT consultant to get wi-fi operating as the autmated version they connect you to simply doe snot help . Here is my suggestion to management please give the front desk a check list on wi-fi and the IP address the guests must type in once the default method fails it obviates the frustrating calls to front desk .  Live entertainment with DJ is one of the hotels attractions only it is not balanced against the interests' of business travelers that have to endure the painful noise all night until dawn .  I would not recommend it to people traveling for bus conventions / expos  live entertainment
30,It was just ok. Nothing that stood out as either awesome or horrible.    The room was extraordinarily small. It was clean. That was about the only positive thing I can say about the room. The bathroom us also also super small. the wife didn’t like not having a bathtub option. Shower only.    Hardly any room for clothing storage so you essentially end up just leaving your clothes in your suitcase.    Not a fan of the electronic checkin. Much prefer human contact.    The drink service was slightly below average in terms of what we’ve experienced elsewhere on the strip.    Cant comment on the restaurants as we didn't try any.    The location of the resort is ideal. Fairly central.
30,The hotel was mobbed when we arrived at 1 pm ;we were told that our room would be ready soon well 2 comes 3 comes and still no room. Policy was 3 pm but we did not get our room until 415; This was not acceptable
40,Park MGM is a great choice when visiting Las Vegas. Good value for your money great restaurants good rooms and a great pool area fitness facilities spas dining experience and location. Casino was great!
30,A business trip and first time at MGM Park. The hotel was located in a good area. Room was clean and staff was helpful. The cigarette smoke in the casino area was bad. No buffet restaurant for a quick breakfast or lunch.
40,The was a very enjoyable Hotel / Casino in a great part of the strip which provided a great path to other venues and restaurants. The pool area was great too. I would consider staying here again. The Casino was fairly small compared to other properties...but still fun.
50,A great location when walking around the strip. So many dining options to choose from and one is better than the next. The Eataly (Italy) dining options are plentiful and amazing. The check-in was painless and the Nighthawk Suite was perfect for our needs. I asked to be located close to the elevator and they met my request. Never were bothered by noise from outside although the room next door played loud music but only during day hours which did not concern us. Geeting to our room from self parking was very easy using the bridge on 2nd floor and we always found a spot on the second floor close to the bridge. Self parking is $15 per day with in out privileges and you use your room key in and out and it it also includes parking at all the MGM properties on the Strip. If there is an event at the T-Mobile Arena it can get a little congested trying to enter and exist so be aware of when you are coming and going to avoid the traffic. We haven't stayed on the Strip for awhile but were very happy with our full experience at the Park MGM. I wouldn't hesitate staying there on our next visit to Las Vegas. If you are looking for absolute luxury this may not be for you. If you are looking for a very clean and comfortable Casino Hotel this ones for you!!! Thanks Park MGM for making my trip a memorable experience.
40,A good hotel and casino in a very good location. Right opposite New York New York with an entrance directly on to the strip. Really cool italian street style market inside the front entrance although we felt this closed a little early considering it is Vegas. Also have some big artists in their own theatre (Aerosmith were on while we were there) though tickets were a little expensive.
50,Really liked everything about this hotel except for the check-in process. Took 30 minutes to use the online process and that's with the staff's help . Hotel is right next to the T-Mobile arena. Walking distance to all shows on the strip. Has a casino. Rates were reasonable.
30,Stayed before when it was the Monte Carlo and would have to say I seem to have liked it better then. While understanding the need for many of their upgrades they also come with pitfalls.  First I found check-in to be very efficient but rather uninviting when you don't actually get welcomed by a real person; this also eliminates the ability to make request. We traveled as a group and with the new room card security system it made meeting up/visiting difficult if not impossible. Your room key will only allow you to use your designated elevator and floor- hence if you have other parties on separate floors you can not visit without them coming to the lobby to meet you.  The new Eately is very nice and there were lots of Italian choices to pick from; however it is pricey and if you wanted a lighter/cheaper choice for a quick lunch you had to go off resort. Lala Noodles was fantastic and reasonable.  The casino floor was very smokey would be nice to see a designated non-smoking area.    The positives - beds and bedding were very comfortable and rooms was nice.  Location next to the Park is great. Service on the casino floor was very quick efficient and courteous. And to put my complaints into perspective some would say; the added room security is great and check-in and out was very efficient.
10,Checked in on a Sat check in time was listed as 3PM. Room was not ready until just shy of 7. We flew in for a show that started at 8 staff was polite but stated that none of the rooms with king sized beds would be ready on time?? Really?? This is Vegas it is not like they normally run at 20% capacity and it was a surprise to be full.
50,This was our first time staying at Park MGM and it was near perfect from their accommodations and amenities to the staff and service. Most importantly Eataly is wonderful beautiful and fun! I would strongly recommend staying here! It's close to everything on the Strip but unique with an old Vegas vibe.
30,Really beautiful hotel with excellent rooms. But the casino is very smokey. I would have spent more time there if not for the smoke. The staff was helpful. We were there to see Gaga's jazz and piano show which was fabulous!
50,Excellent I will stay at ur hotel again when I return next year. Me n my family had a blast. Win some n lose some but best of all we had fun. Enjoy the casino every night  the food was delicious specially the baked chicken n roasted potatoes. My sister enjoy her 50th birthday in Vegas
50,Love the location of this hotel/casino. Eataly is a great place to eat so many choices. The rooms were clean great views of the roller coaster and hockey venue. Lady GaGa performed (and fell) here during our stay. Very convenient to attend the convention and be able to relax on breaks.  We would stay here again!
30,Only a couple restaurants open after 11:00 pm on a weekend and if it weren’t for LaLa Noodle restaurant would have to eat elsewhere. Casino was very loud and probably more attractive to a younger crowd. Room was nice and liked the seating by the window with a view of the T Mobile Arena which we attended a concert. Short walk from the hotel to the Arena. Would have been nice if there was a refrigerator in the room but would stay here again if we have a concert at T Mobile.
50,This is my 3rd time staying at Park MGM this year and I Iove it. Great rooms with very comfy beds and great bathrooms. I love the shower. Super clean rooms and property. I always say it the housekeeping staff at Park MGM is WONDERFUL they do such a great job. The hotel is perfectly situated with easy access to Bellagio and Aria. So may great food options Eatlay is AMAZING weI eat there everyday. And if you are a Gaga fan this the place to be with the Haus of Gaga and her show being right there. Can't wait to be back in December for more gaga.
20,"We were in Vegas for my sisters wedding. Arrived on a Tuesday night. There was no people working at a check-in counter. Had to use a tablet to check-in. Each button press was either very delayed or inaccurate. The ""ID"" scanner did not function at all Unsure of what I was doing finally someone came over and did an over-ride on the tablet. Didn't say Hi or check my ID just skipped to the next step and left. Terrible welcome experience.  Get up to the room. It is dated. The coffee table in the room has water stains and rings on it. White residue left over on the couch. Wasn't super impressed with the room in general. Make sure not to touch the Mini Bar. 16$ for a bottle of water. Glad I read the fine print. The one nice thing was the large walk in shower.  A very lack luster experience for the almost 200$ a night after resort fees."
40,When you combine with the amenities of adjacent New York New York this is a good location and very nice property. Didn't discover the short cut on tram to Bellagio until the last day. Small but adequate casino. Very nice sports bar.
20,If you want to spend an exorbitant amount of money go somewhere else. No coffee maker in the room. $54.00 simple bacon and egg breakfast food was luke warm long wait (over 1 hours) for the food they don't have there own kitchen where the food comes from. $1000+ for 3 nights.
40,Our stay was very good overall. While the ParkMGM is touted as a new resort you should know there is little change in the rooms and especially fixtures/furnishings from when it was the Monte Carlo. Hopefully MLife will remodel the rooms in the near future so that the next time I choose to stay here I can give a better review.    The staff is super friendly here as at all other MLife resorts I have visited. Restaurants (especially Eataly) offer many options and high quality foods that can please almost any palate. The casino was well organized and staff there were often entertaining as well as professional.    I hope they will make some upgrades soon so I would want to return to stay again. MLife offers many other properties to choose from that have much higher quality rooms.
10,Most disappointing stay in Vegas!! We literally felt like it was a glorified Motel 6. Minimal restaurant choices in the hotel uncomfortable bed and no basic necessities in the room such as coffee maker and mini-fridge. Best part is the location next to the T-Mobile Arena since we went to a show.
50,Centrally located. Knights play across the street and 5 minutes to Aria and 10 to Bellagio. Restaurants were delish..... Eataly is a must go. Room was spacious and clean. Bathroom was modern. Only complaint is that AC could be better
20,"I stayed twice at this hotel here is my experience:    First the upsides (the only reason I give two stars):    1. The rooms despite looking different than other Vegas hotels are quite nice. The bed and bedding the leather chair and the sofa were all very comfortable.    2. Location is pretty good and you can connect to center of the action with a quick tram ride.    3. The remodel is pretty much done so the casino and restaurants are all there and looking nice. Eataly is very cool adds prestige to the Strip.    Now the downsides:    1. Being greeted(!) by a machine sucks. And I don't care about the human touch as much but their system is very crappy. It has several problems and I had to check with the agent (there are 2-3 people walking around the kiosks) several times. So was it really worth updating in to the machines then? Here are the various problems I encountered at the kiosks:  - The day before I got an email to pre-check in. I tried but it was showing a way higher rate/night for the room. I thought there was a problem so didn't proceed.  - On the day I arrived at 1:30 PM. The kiosk still showed the high rate. So I had to clarify with an agent that my original rate was correct and that I shouldn't worry about what I see on the kiosk (well then why do I see that?). So I proceeded with the check-in and it said the room was not ready. I gave my email address so that it would inform me when the room was ready till 3 PM.  - I waited until 3PM and no email arrived. I tried another kiosk and it was asking all the information again. Then I understood that the earlier check-in at 1:30 just went down the drain and I waited 1:30 hrs for nothing. When I asked about this to the agent she confirmed and put the blame on system glitch.  - Then I proceeded to print the keys and the machine cannot print them. An agent showed up and told me that those kiosks were for check-out only and they cannot print keys. Well then why was there a button that said ""check-in"" on it? She printed my keys from somewhere else and came back with them.  - At one stage my reservation turned from King to Two Queens without my knowledge and request. And thankfully the agent bringing me the keys resolved that issue.  - Some kiosks have passport readers some have QR code readers. But you don't know about this until the kiosk asks you to put your passport into the reader and you figure out that there is none on the kiosk you selected. Then the agent says ""oh you should have selected a kiosk with a passport reader"". I should've done a lot of things like not picking this hotel for my precious vacation time.    2. I had a problem with the TV and I called guest services. I waited on line for about 20 minutes to get to an agent. She resolved the problem but this was like calling a call center and had nothing to do with hospitality industry. I am there right then and now and you better resolve my problem fast. This is how hotels work.    3. They ask for $42 resort fee yet there is no fridge no coffee maker no complimentary water etc. Even the worst motel chains offer these three as part of their amenities. Also as someone mentioned they didn't even care to put a fridge to be able to sell cold water as the only offer they have is a $16 Fiji Water that's been sitting outside for who knows how long.    4. Both times I had a connector room and I was able to hear everything my neighbors talked about or watched on TV. I was lucky that they were not super noisy but can't imagine being next door to someone noisy.    That check-in process and the service problems left a bad taste in my mouth and I don't think I would stay here again."
40,The location was great and had much to offer walking north from property. The staff was nice. The decor was good too. I thought the prices for rooms were great but th restaurants were all pricey. I would stay again.
40,We just returned from a lovely weekend in Las Vegas where we stayed at the Park MGM. The staff were helpful and friendly the PRIMROSE RESTAURANT breakfast was so delicious that we ate there twice!! I wasn't crazy about the room set up though it was comfortabe enough but there wasn't enough storage in the room or the bathroom.That being said the loation was good and the tram to the Bellagio was very convient.
50,Good value and location. Excellent significant from the MONTE CARLO days. Enjoyed many fine meals and JUNIPER Bar made most excellent cocktails. EATILY an Itailian themed dining area with every conciecievable Beverabe / Pasta/ Bread/ Pastry etc from Italy was very fun.
50,If you love everything italian you must visit Eataly at the Park MGM. Wonderful place to grab a bite enjoy a glass of wine or splurge on gelato! They also offer several confections for all Nutella fans!
20,Apparently this hotel has been remodeled but I wasn’t impressed. The service is terrible. The Concierge people were worthless. They couldn’t even tell me how the bus works - the gal says “I don’t take the bus.” Really? Waiting an hour for a table for the only restaurant that serves a real breakfast was ridiculous. But you can’t have a cup coffee in your room because there is no coffee maker! And there was no little refrigerator to keep water which you need in Las Vegas cold. I found that to be very cheap on their part yet they leave warm water bottles in the room that can be yours for $15! Screw that. The walls are paper thin. I had to go to Walgreens to get ear plugs after the first night because I could hear the thump thump of the music outside all night from the 17th floor! The room was clean enough but the carpet had numerous stains which I found to be rather gross. You can’t get any sun at the pool unless you time it just right because it’s on ground level and is surrounded by other buildings. How about a rooftop pool? The positive is the theater which is wonderful (we were there specifically for Lady Gaga) and the shower was awesome. Additionally my friend had fallen before she traveled and had fractured her arm. She needed paramedics at one point to assist and they and an employee named Ashley (I think) were wonderful. All in all the place left a bad taste in my mouth.
10,I've been visiting Las Vegas for 20+ years and this is one of the worst hotels for the price paid. The windows/walls are thin so if hearing what the other room is doing and listening to the dull thud of a night club until 3 a.m. is enjoyable then this is the hotel for you. You will could also enjoy the challenge of trying to see how few towels you could get from room service or trying to find someone to speak with to resolve any issues you may have. The room also feels much smaller than advertised and the single door for the bathroom / closet is awkward and the bedding reminds me of something you'd find in a cheap motel.    I strongly encourage you to shop around before selecting this hotel much better values can be found on the strip . . . this hotel should only be selected as desperate last measure.
50,Loved it in so many ways.  Very relaxing. Primrose restaurant had a quaint European Cafe feel with wonderful pancakes. Eataly is a fun concept but not the best when it comes to value. Pizza was good...Pasta portion was very small.
20,Shower overflowed due to a clog & we switched rooms. That room still had garbage in it & the next day the attendant forgot to clean the garbage again and left the cleaning supplies. 4 hours later it’s still now cleaned.
30,We have been going to this property for over 15 years. Losing the lazy river and Diablo’s ruined our fun here. The music at the pool makes me want to fall asleep. Hardly any people at the pool this trip and mostly old people. Diablo’s was a blast! Why?!? Rooms are nice. Only reason we would go back is our friends at the hotel.
30,Slow draining shower.  Toilet paper dispenser falling out of wall.  Towels not restocked after cleaning  No drawers to put away clothes. Literally none.  Loud music even on 25th floor one night until 2AM  Restaurant employee snapped at me for pointing out she short changed me.
20,No one seems to care whether you are there or not. Very in personal and check-in was a perfect example. No help to be found. Rooms were not very clean. Location is good and being close to Eatly was a plus. Better choices on the strip.
20,The lack of customer service available at check-in I found frustrating. Automated check-in is great for certain customers and situations but I wanted to talk to someone about upgrading and could not do that. Their food court was not open when we first got there at 11am. I found food options are limited (& expensive) here as opposed to other hotels on the strip. On the plus side the room was clean and the bed was very comfortable.
10,After traveling across the country I was greeted by a kiosk. No hospitality no welcome to Vegas no information on WiFi food etc. upon check out I had a problem with the bill but could find no one to assist me. (Again all kiosk based) I tried to return to the original screen to check out but it wouldn’t  allow it and I ended up being charged for services I did not use. I am disgusted by MGM’s lack of hospitality and utter disregard for the importance of human interaction all in the name of saving money. Human kindness and interaction is the cornerstone of the hospitality industry. Epic fail!
30,Poor room quality. The Room was always hot even though the thermostat was on 60. Also no mini fridge to store child drinks. Hotel location was good but hotel was very basic. I also asked for tooth paste and was told they didnt have any.
20,Stayed at the Park for the first time as we were attending the Lady Gag show with friends. Automated check-in was a mess with lots of confused people and too few staff. There was no ID scanner at the check-in terminal we were directed too so could not check-in and had to start again at another terminal having found no-one available to help despite calling for help on the terminal. It's a good idea to speed up the arrival process in a large property but very poorly executed.    The room was nice enough - fairly new and spacious - and smelled clean. We were in a hurry to change for a dinner event and found out why it smelled of cleaning products when we went to change shoes: the carpet was soaking wet from being shampooed that day and had not had time to dry. Due to dinner bookings we did not have time to try and change rooms - specially with the check-in chaos downstairs - so told the only human available at the concierge desk. He apparently logged the issue but no-one followed up with us during or after our stay and we just put towels on the floor so we could move around without getting wet feet.    Finally yes it's Vegas and most of the time you're going to stay up late having fun but if you do want to try and sleep before 2am be sure to try and get a room away from the nightclub side. It's poorly insulated and the thumping base can be heard all the way up to the high floors until 2am. Oh wait: you may not be able to request a room away from the noise BECAUSE THERE ARE NO HUMANS TO TALK TO AT CHECK-IN!!!    Lastly - resort fees. If you're using the pool and gym I get it. If you're on a trip where you don't use those services like us and like so many business trips I take it always feels like gouging a total rip off extra money from guests like airline baggage fees. I wish hotels would just build this into the price instead of adding $37 + $5 tax when you check out. It leaves a really bad taste.
30,Kiosk for check-in is a bit of a beating so old adults flustered by technology should not stay here. The guest rooms are spacious and have a comfy chair & sofa. Bathroom is spacious & all the hooks are appreciated. Towels are a bit old and be sure to bring a shower cap if you don't want your hair to get wet when bathing. Make-up mirror is lovely to have.
10,The rooms are nice bathrooms are very nice but the service is terrible. You check yourself in on a kiosk. If you think this speeds the process up think again. I waited 30 minutes in line to be treated bad by the floaters helping people on the kiosk. No one will answer questions or provide you with any sort of tips/recommendations on the hotel. Apparently it is all on the TV in your room. If you are fine with searching for information and having no staff interaction this is the hotel for you. If you like a more personal experience I would suggest staying somewhere else.
10,The self check in had a long line and no one to help us out with a question. When I finally found someone the lady seemed bothered that I asked for help. I couldn’t believe how rude she was towards me. Another thing that happened during my stay was that water shut off while I was showering making me late to the event I was attending. I called the front desk and the lady was extremely rude to me. She also had the worst customer service ever. The bell lady they helped us with our luggage had a bad attitude.It’s such a shame that this hotel is beautiful yet very bad customer service. I stayed October 16-182019.
40,The Park MGM has been under renovations for the past 16 months and it keeps getting better & better!! The new Italian Eataly food court is fantastic and offers quick access to the strip!! Additionally its location is great for families with New York New York & T-Mobile Arena(Las Vegas Knights) right across the street and MGM Grand across the Strip by way of the overpass cross walk. Still within walking distance to the Bellagio fountains and other site attractions
50,Myself and my husband stayed here in October for 8 nights. We loved this hotel. We find the location in this part of the strip excellent. And very handy with the Aria Express to get you as far down as Bellagio if you don't want to walk.  We had a room on the 28th floor with a view down to the pools. I can honestly say the beds... are the most comfortable I have ever slept in. We both slept so well every night. Yes the storage is limited but you manage.  The rooms themselves are spacious comfortable and have a fabulous bathroom with large walk in shower.  The staff we encountered were all very nice and helpful  The drinks were plentiful when gambling in the casino  We ate breakfast in Primrose one morning and it was lovely.  I can highly recommend this hotel and hope to return when we next get to return to Las Vegas
20,Check in was self-check and confusing. Room we booked and paid for was not available hotel hallways were very dark restaurants were not open until after 5 or 6 pm except for the very high priced Eataly which is all self serve and extremely expensive. Bud Light was $9.10 and a glass of average wine was $18.00
30,No home away from home . was our family reunion. It was bad.people were rude. The staff was not helpful. Over charged with deposits. Generally not a good experience. Will not recommend ever. Very disappointed.
30,I come to Vegas at least once a year I've stayed at Caesar's Venetian Bellagio Mirage and Mandalay Bay. This is my first stay here and I will never stay here again. I am writing this from my hotel room on the second night of my four night stay and I can safely promise I will never stay here again. On the bright side I don't need to bring any friends since I basically get to spend every night hanging out with everyone else in this hotel. I can hear EVERYTHING in any other room nearby. I don't need to turn on my TV if my neighbors are watching since I can hear it as well as if it is in my own room. I can hear everything happening in the park below and I'm on the ninth floor. I truly considered buying cough syrup for my other neighbor since she coughed all night and I heard every single one. If this sounds good to you this is the hotel for you!  I've never experienced anything like this in all of my trips to Vegas. Just stay somewhere else if you care about your sleep at all.
40,Excellent stay and layout For the hotel and casino. The room are good but can hear the neighbors conversation on each side. Pool area is very nice easy access to shopping and the strip. Geared more towards the younger generation
40,A very nice stay and an impressive and stylish hotel.    The renos and upgrade over its former Monte Carlo identity are excellent with now with a classy arty and also slightly eclectic look in decor.    The location can't be beat - directly mid-Strip. Though the urban plaza beside can get extremely busy and noisy on a Golden Knights game night it is also a handy alternative for a stroll (outdoors instead of through the casino) and outdoor patios and bistros & bars.    Watch out for the aggressive call girls that hang out in front of the entrance (unless you want that kinda thing!)    Amazing Eataly location within the front doors of the casino and property - a treat! The hotel also has some groovy bars and other eateries that spill off the casino - more original and less conventional than other casinos have.    I got free breakfast daily included here from my travel agent in Primrose and it was excellent and elaborate. strong coffee and lots of food each morning. Primrose cafe also has a good Happy Hour each afternoon.    It is superb and handy to have a free tram that operates from The Park through the next door Aria and ends at The Bellagio... though the walk through each/both ends of The Park as well as Bellagio properties just to get to each's station takes a million years and a long hike! (still better and quicker than walking the expanse of this distance along The Strip of course).    Weird unfriendly / unwelcoming and anonymous auto-Check-In on computer screens instead of actually having a human behind a Check-In desk. A minor point (for me) but not so very pleasant in the moment - made me feel like using an auto-check-out at a supermarket (which I despise). Though admittedly there were one or two hotel staff members loitering around to assist and answer any questions as needed.    The rooms are not so large (as Vegas casino hotels can often be oversized by default) but are functional stylish (colourful) and a decent size overall - so not small or anything. Huge walk-in shower was nice. And all looked brand-new - a credit to the quality and degree of the refurb from Monte Carlo to now Park.    All other service and staff throughout were quality and professional and there whenever you needed them (except for check-in as noted).    Being a stylish property great location and affordable - I'll be back!
40,Nice hotel. Only Issues I had were the self check in iPad was different I miss actually talking to people. The hotel was clean and next to a lot of food options that are of good value would stay again
30,No refrigerator. No place to put towels in bathroom so no counter space. No place to put clothes except small stand up closet. You can't refrigerate your beverages of choice. You will have to iron a lot if there are two of you. The facility is updated and the location is really nice. It is Vegas so you won't spend much time in your room but even the lowest-budget hotels have these basic amenities. Rooms just feel like they got a little less love. The water went out while we were trying to shower and get ready for a concert we had been waiting months for but stuff happens. Took them about 90 minutes or so to fix but no explanation no anything.
30,Checkin at hotel can be confusing as lines build up and only a few staff are available to guide some guests. Room was clean but vacuuming could have been better. Very thin walls can hear water running
30,Newly renovated from the Monte Carlo hotel I expected this M resort hotel to be superior and it clearly was not. The rooms are smaller than I have ever had on the strip. The hotel is dated and casino dark with usual cast of pricey restaurants. The one exception is Eataly which is a wonderful voyage of different Italian treats including pasta pizza cheeses desserts etc.
20,This hotel was excellent when it was Monte Carlo. The Eataly was great but that was about it. The affordable dining and shopping is gone. The rooms no longer have dressers and the showers lack any space to put your shampoo etc on (unless you are only looking to put a bar of soap in the shower). The walls are so thin we could hear the guest in the next room raising the blinds. Bed did not have the sheets changed room was so dusty we felt sick and tv stuck on 1 channel even after replacing the remote. Very disappointed as I have stayed here several times when it was Monte Carlo.
50,The MGM ParkPlace was wonderful.  We only had a short walk to the concert venue. The concert arena was wonderful very intimate. Not a bad seat in the place. The staff we encountered were all friendly and helpful. Everything we wanted it to be!!
30,The hotel experience was good however not being a MLife member almost makes you feel like an outcast. The check in process feels like an airport checkin not what my wife and I are used to when checking in to hotels. You can only get a person to help you check in if your a VIP or if your part of the MLife club. I think that was the biggest dissatisfaction for us. The room we got had a nice view but we could hear people through the vents.
30,Husband and I stayed at Park MGM for a quick anniversary trip. Overall the stay was good and would recommend. We got there around 12 and had to wait until 3 for a room to be ready. We booked a king but because we did it through a third party we ended up with two queens. The room was clean and nice. Comfortable bed and pillows. The location was great and we used the tram several times to get over to the Bellagio. Food options within the hotel were good. Service was ok and prices were high but that’s just Vegas.
50,From the check in (which they allowed at 10AM!) to the pool staff to the cleanliness of the room to the restaurants to the dealers to the housekeeping staff.....everything was top notch. It’s easy to forget that the Mirage was EVER there. Keep doing what ur doing Ill remain loyal!
30,Good location Casino was nice - minimums are a little high. Hotel hallways were a little dark but rooms were adequate. Note: We were comped so did not really have a lot of complaints. Generally a good experience with Park MGM. Been here a number of times. Pretty good value.
30,The old poor Monte Carlos got renovated to the new Park MGM. New skin old shell.    The plus  - The addition of Eataly was nice plus.  - good location  - renovated rooms strong shower pressure  - bedside ports and usb outlets  - new eating places  - very friendly checking service  - digital app check in  - digital key using Bluetooth phone  - tram connects to aria and belliagio    The minus  - no EV charging available  - charge for parking  - low ceilings poor ventilation very smoky  - carpet dirty  - some restaurants mediocre quality    The seriously need some EV chargers. Especially for Tesla. The Venetian Aria Bellagio Linq and others have them. Can’t believe a newly renovated place would not consider some.
30,Don't leave the hotel in your vehicle when there is a hockey game you will have major trouble getting back to the hotel and parking. They are more worried about charging for parking to the people attending the game then there guest staying at the hotel.
40,So stayed three nights in September. My first stay and have to stay rooms  and locations are great. Easy access to other hotels via the monorail. I wanted to patronize Eataly a bit more but for some reason when I returned after a show it wasn't open. Have to say though the hallways - and lighting near the doors are very dim. Like too dark. Stay was comfortable. Was on the T Mobile side so if there is a game or concert  it does get noisy on that side. Returning soon to visit Best Friends restaurant. Rate too high so I won't be staying there at next trip. Uber/Lyft access is so convenient at this hotel. Appreciate that. Only concern I did have is that I paid for the early check in and I was told I would get an email or text notification. I didn't . I ended up showing back up near 1:00 and they said my room was ready. Not sure what happened. Bit confused w/ the self check in desk so I went to staff at the VIP. Wasn't given a map nor anything of the property.
40,When we walked into the hotel the 70s green paint and dated dark lobby made me think we picked the wrong hotel halls were dark too but the bed and shower made things better. It’s in a great location and price is perfect if you’re looking for a lower price point than on the main strip but want to be close.
10,Grossly understaffed hotel! There's not nearly enough people assisting with the absolutely moronic self-check-in process. My room wasn't ready at 10:30PM when I arrived. There was no manager anywhere to help me. I was sent to the VIP area with the other 15-20 customers whose rooms were not ready. There was one person working the VIP area. Really?    My sink clogged and I had to wait two hours to get it fixed. Then later in the day my water was turned off -- right at dinner time -- leaving my toilet filled with feces and my friend using bottled water to brush her teeth.    I had to call two days in a row to get my room cleaned and both times I requested extra towels -- you provide TWO for a suite? -- and neither time were any delivered.    Nobody answers your phones...everything is message on hold. There's no excuse for it.
20,The newly renovated Park MGM is lovely but small and overcrowded. Check in is a do it yourself kiosk. Lines for check in and the bell desk were quite long. While it is nice to receive updates on your room status via your phone this is a missed opportunity to provide a first impression of great customer service. The primrose cafes food is mediocre and terribly over priced. The bell desk attendants are wonderful but not supported in busy times. The bell attendants were the only human contact we had with staff during our stay. Everything else is do it yourself. Not my idea of a relaxing vacation.
50,Just got back from a 4 night stay at Park MGM - got together with family and friends. Vegas is a great place to meet up. Park MGM is new and fresh but wish they had a refrigerator to keep water and drinks cool. I would definitely stay here again.
50,I really enjoy my stay at the Park MGM Great Location close to everything  service was excellent fun place beautiful pool. Very clean hotel the room are awesome and very roomy. I Will definite stay again at the Park MGM. Thanks
50,Always a pleasure and looking forward to our next visit we have chosen Monte CarloPARK MGM.. since it opened !! Loyal to Park MGM... nice size casino excellent employees.. treat us like family.. thank you!!
50,Easy to get around and great food I would stay here again. Location of the hotel is good too you can take the tram from Park MGM to Bellagio to save some time walking or to stay out of the heat. Great Hotel!!!
30,probaly wouldnt stay here again not very comfortable no one made me feel good we didnt even get our room cleaned?? 2 days?? ive stayed at all the mlife properties this one wasnt as fun but the girl at the vip services mad me smile she helped me
40,Enjoyed the location and staff at this hotel. Very accessible to all things Vegas with lots of options in house. Check in process needs to be streamlined as well as the room service turn time. Other than that- very satisfied and would stay here again.
20,Very dated rooms. Rooms on their website don’t match up. Previous wallpaper in rooms was just painted over. There is no room to store any clothes. There was only on tiny 4 drawer skinny dresser. Hardly any cocktail waitress on casino floor. I also waited 15 min to get money out of my non working roulette table. My order at Eately was lost and the manager was not apologetic about the situation. Waited 25 min for a sandwich while watching everyone else that was behind my in line get their food. Very disappointed stay.
10,Check in is a pain. Wayfinding sucks. Layout is designed to push people to the casino (it's Vegas so of course) and not to be able to find an exit. Glad my client was paying as I'd have been po'd to have paid for this place out of my wallet.
40,The renovations make this hotel a really solid choice for a Las Vegas stay. Classic casino several restaurants super-cool EATALY are all great. Stayed in a room with the green accents. The furniture in the rooms is nice and very comfortable - both the armchairs and the window seats. The location is central on the strip and very handy. This review would be a full excellent except for one thing -- they took away the old Monte Carlo Poker Room. If Park MGM is smart they'll find room for a new poker room as soon as they can!
30,Great Value. Great Location.... Automated check in system not so great. If you are planning to stay here go to the VIP desk and check in with a real person. My card was charged 3 separate times with a deposit due to the automated system problems
30,The staff was wonderful. We stayed in the old sections of the hotel and the room needed to be updated. Needed new carpet and updated decor. We love the MGM hotels but was a little disappointed in our room this trip.
40,Came early week to Vegas for my first time and was able to stay here. The hotel room was clean and bright bed was amazing and so was the view. It would be convenient to have a mini fridge and coffee maker in the rooms as it is a pretty standard now a days especially that this hotel is newer.  The pool was nice location was convenient and easy walk to most places.  Overall nice spot and would consider returning another time.
50,Very nice and good experience. simply well done. Not too over the top but not low end either. Very good tier of service rooms food etc. I would highly reccommend the hotel due to its upper middle class scaling of experience.
50,Love The Park MGM. It’s a great place to stay especially if attending a hockey game. Love Eataly it’s a great experience.  However Vegas is out-pricing itself on all beverages. $15 for pool beverage.
40,Location of hotel cannot be beat. Proximity to T Mobile Arena is great. The only drawback was the room itself. There were 2 tiny drawers to store clothes and not enough space in the bathroom. Windows need a good cleaning to improve view. No clock of any kind in the room.
50,My husband and I stayed in 2015 when it was the Monte Carlo. It has had a stunning makeover. Location wise it’s perfect and the tram was a godsend. We were one of the unfortunate couples who booked with Thomas Cook. We arrived to a letter from Thomas cook saying they had cancelled all the bookings. The hotel staff were beyond exceptional understanding compassionate and just as shocked as we were. The hotel manager took care of everything. He knew it was atol protected and they would get their money eventually even gave us $75 credit to get some dinner. The rooms were beautiful clean and light. The casino was tidy and the bar staff and cocktail girls very friendly. We visit Vegas twice a year and I would happily stay at the park on every visit if the offers on it are good! At the moment for 2020 it’s looking pricey but it will always be my first choice. I cannot thank the wonderful staff enough for making what could of been a holiday disaster into one the best trips we have had.
30,1st Cousins Vegas Trip. Me and my cousin took a vegas trip to get away from every day work and family. The trip was wonderful and the Park MGM room was just okay. I would not suggest this hotel to any of my relatives.
30,Need to up date the rooms because they are out dated. There should be a better variety of restaurants to pick from there should be a softer selection of towels and wash clothes and there should be more staff available
50,me and my family were delighted with this hotel everything was perfect the service of the staff and the rooms very comfortable well clean make you want to stay again.    Without a doubt the next visit in Las Vegas I will stay at this hotel
50,I absolutely loved this resort. The rooms are brand new and the property has so many options for dinning and entertainment. Not to mention the nightlife is great between on the record juniper and mama rabbit.
30,Too many fees from resort to parking to service charges on drinks. Rooms very average no fridge and the “drawers “ are a joke. Not crazy about the self check in process but it’s certainly not a deal breaker.
40,Great value clean rooms casino felt new but slightly empty at times through the week. Younger crowd then other hotels but veritably felt clearer then the other resorts at the same price point. Nice location next to Aria and other resorts.
50,My wife and I really enjoy park MGM because of location service food and proximity to the other MGM locations that we like to visit. It really is the perfect balance at the Park and Eataly is the bomb.
50,pleasant experience and would recommend this to friends and family.The staff were all very nice and her helpful. The room were amazing the black out curtains made the room so dark it made it nice to sleep in. The beds were extremely comfortable as well.
20,As a long-standing member of M life my family and I are accustomed to great service and experiences. We enjoyed ourselves as we always do but with all of the options in Las Vegas we expected more. Although we may choose another Mlife hotel for a future stay we will not return to Park MGM.
30,Great location. Average room amenities. Short run to the airport. Restaurants were very good. No complaints there. Ride share confusion with pick ups. Apparently it's so close to the Aria that they go there first. Be careful.
50,My stay was very enjoyable and the staff were all very friendly. The check in was a breeze as well as the check out. Would recommend anyone to stay here. Their are plenty of shops and other hotels near by lots of choices.
10,Full of drunk kids with fake ids. We will never visit this property again. The casino has the worst ventilation of any Vegas property. Food over priced poor service and poor food preparation. The rooms are very cheaply furnished and noisy. We also had cigarette smoke from other rooms and the hallway coming into our room thru the ventilation system. We stay in Las Vegas a lot and this was the worst experience we have ever had.
50,This was our second time staying at the Park MGM. The location of this place is fantastic. It's pretty much central to everything that you want to do in Vegas. The casino is on the smaller side but that's a plus because it's easy to find your way through it without getting lost! They have a great variety of slots/video poker and 99% of the time you can get on the type of machine that you want. The people that work the tables are friendly and will help you if you are new to a game. The rooms are clean and tidy and the beds are very comfortable. Even if you don't stay here you need to visit LaLa Noodle - this is by far the best noodle restaurant on the strip! Excellent food service speed and prices! Go there! Also you have to visit the Crack Shack - hands down the best fried chicken that I've ever had! My only comment on improvement for this place is the check in process. It's automated and while they have improved it from the last time that i stayed there it still gives me an issue when it comes to verifying my ID on the scanner. Other than that this is a fantastic place to stay! They have improved the storage in the rooms now and you have 4 small drawers to put your stuff in now which is better than the two that you used to get.
50,Young lady at VIP desk was able with great determination and patience to help us have a room to sleep in after my reservation was messed up by the party I was dealing with to set it up. Super Kudos to Park MGM!
20,I generally stay at the Palazzo but decided to try the Park.  Poor check in we upgraded and the rooms look toward the strip and you can almost see it. There is a opening in the roof that looks toward the strip and it is a Hip Hop Club.. The bumping goes from 10pm-3am and will rattle your fillings. The Non Upgraded side puts you overlooking the pool Aria and others and is beautiful and peaceful (we moved rooms). The beds are horrible.  The restaurant by check in has the rudest staff and they open at (when ever they feel like it).  I booked it at the end of the month (prepaid) because friends are coming in and staying at the MGM (YUCK).  If I hadn't prepaid I would stay at the Palazzo and take a taxi.
50,Went with fiends to enjoy gambling and food and that’s exactly what happen and i would love to do it again hopefully my room is free next time since i lost 6000$ but i still had a good time so I’m ok with that
50,Park MGM is the best choice to meet all your needs. They have excellent food choices especially being located with Eately. Great pool and the rooms are very well done. It’s not a large resort/ casino which we find perfect. We have now been there 5 times and it will always be our top choice.
20,If you are over 21 you might enjoy looking into another Mlife property. Especially if you expect to hang more than 5 items in the closet space provided... but beware if you are looking in the closet and someone has to go in or out of the bathroom you will get hit with the one sliding door for both! Also interesting in the room set up is that the bed faces one direction and the tv another. You cannot turn the tv to where you could watch from the bed. The restaurant choices do not measure up to other properties. However it is easy to go to Aria or the Bellagio from here. But why have to do this when you would be better off just staying there from the start.
50,Just had an amazing time at the Park MGM. The T-Mobile center is right next store. Very convenient because I saw the Vegas Nights play Friday night. The MoneyLink sports book is a great bar with TVs everywhere.
40,great location comfortable friendly staff. ask for a smoke free room if needed. gorgeous layout close to all day clubs and night clubs we attended. casino was fun as well. concierge was approachable if youre in need of plans
30,I expected more since I had heard the hotel was recently updated. First I did not like the self check-in process. Had to wait for a staff member for assistance. Our room was extremely small with no dressers. There was no place to put our luggage. Placed them on the sofa. The room faced a concrete wall. When we asked to change our room they said there was nothing they could do since it was all done through the check-in process. The halls are extremely dark. It was difficult to see our room number on the door. The towels and bed sheets were not white. They were very old looking with a washed out gray tinge.
50,Excellent customer service. Great location! Everyone goes out of their way to assist you..the self check in/ out was easy to use. Visited bavettes steak house it was amazing.. had breakfast at eataly this was a great idea for your hotel as well!
20,"I normally only do good reviews but this place had the worst rooms I have ever stayed in. They have a cool lighting system but that's about it. This is my 5th time to Vegas and the wife and I chose the stay well rooms here. Every night I woke in the middle of the night due to my nose getting congested and with a sore throat. Thing is everytime that I left the room it all cleared up in 10 min. No more sore throat or congestion...the beds were the hardest I've ever slept on which also kept me up. If the stay well is an ""Upgrade"" I dont know what was upgraded...terrible. I know they dont care but will never do MGM again."
50,The best hotel around that area of the strip by far  recenlty refurbed. rooms are excellent as is the facilities. cannot fault this . Going back next year again. If your looking at new york mgm grand or excaliber save the effort
50,Great service. Staff is quick and everyone has a great attitude. When a place has bitter workers or slow to no service I will leave and not come back. This is a casino I will return to for sure even if I do not have a room here.
30,We took a short vacation in Las Vegas and decided to try Park MGM. Didn't like the check-in kiosks. We needed hotel staff to help us (who were very friendly and happy to help). Our room was next to an elevator which was very noisy all night. Restaurants were very expensive. Table game minimums were consistently too high all hours of the day. Only saw 1 cocktail waitress when playing video poker. I guess you had to be playing $25.00 blackjack to get a cocktail.
50,Stayed here for the Aerosmith concert and it was very convient since the concert was in the hotel. Our room was clean had a great bed and a beautiful view of the strip. There were plenty of good places to eat in the hotel in the area called Eataly. The hotel was beautiful and very convient to the strip.
50,My first time in Vegasthey say what happens in Vegas stays in vegas...except I have to say I was impressed with the MGM Park. The staff was accommodatingthe food exemplanaryand the venue awesome(we were there for the Aerosmith concert)  I wouldnt change a thing...well except bigger winnings in the casino...hahaha
50,Hotel was nice and easy. Room was very good and I loved the bathroom. I loved the sportsbook but was disappointed in the mlife. I spend alot of money and time on these apps. I'm upset it changed but still loved the park mgm
20,Wouldn't recommend this MGM property to anyone over 40. Had may issues with parking over charges room location billing MLife promo etc. Better off at NY NY next door with a better selection of restaurants slot machines and table games
20,I did not feel comfortable I upgraded to a king stay well room. When I got there the king stay well rooms were all taken. So they put me in another room. That was the start. And the whole stay was bad. Never got better. Loud all night long. Paper thin walls in rooms. No storage for clothes. Dirty casino etc
10,Check in is at 3pm and no surprise there’s a long line but once you check in you potentially have to wait for 2 hours for your room to be ready. What? Where else have you checked in and your room wasn’t ready? In order to check in you need to use a a machine and while there are probably close to 60 people trying to get to there room there is only one worker on the floor helping with these issues...she said they’re waiting on housekeeping isn’t normal check out time 11am where they have 4pm to clean the room?    Unfortunately this is only the beginning of our stay here. Advice: STAY FAR AWAY.
40,We stayed at Park MGM for a mom and daughter trip.    We loved the casino but the low ceilings make the casino seem smokey. There is a variety of slot machines and table games to keep everyone entertained.    Rooms were clean and comfortable. The blinds do a good job of blocking out light so sleeping in is easier. Rooms are equipped with a safe in the closet.    There are plenty of good restaurants but I really loved Eataly! There is something for everyone pasta station pizza station seafood station butcher station etc.    I would definitely stay at Park MGM again.
10,Our first night everyone woke up several times hot. The best day the hotel sent someone to come look at our A/C. He said it should be fine and to keep it on high. They automatically turn back to Auto after a time. We returned around 10 from a wedding and our room was uncomfortable warm. I return to the VIP desk to inform them. The only solution that was provided was to pack up my room and bring everything to the lobby wait in line again & then they would issue me a new room. The desk said they would comp my resort fee for the evening for being miserably hot but never did. Also the room was very dusty & the quiet shut feature on the sliding bathroom did not work. There was also a stain on the couch cushion by the window. Ew.
50,Great place to stay in Vegas. Check in and printed our room keys ourselves went well. They do have employees that will help you if you do have a problem. Never had to wait long for a elevator. The room was very clean and bed was very comfortable! The bathroom had a nice big shower. The new restaurants gives you lots of different choices so they certainly can please everyone. The pool area was beautiful and had a waitress taking our drink order. The casino had plenty of choices of slot machines. The location was perfect. Can’t wait to go again!
50,This was our first time staying at Park MGM. The rooms were spacious and clean the staff was very friendly and eager to pleaseexcellent location on the strip and great food. We saw AEROSMITH which was one of the highlights of our trip amazing show. Great job to all the staff at Park MGM and looking forward to our next trip there!!!!
40,I stayed here for 2 nights. The room was nice and modern. I didn't notice any noise issues as some have stated but perhaps I had quiet neighbors. I checked-in by mobile phone beforehand and they sent me a room number this was so convenient! When I arrived at ParkMGM I wanted to print my room keys but all the kiosks went down and an employee sent all of us by the kiosks over to the VIP check in desk to get our keys there.  Besides that employee the only other person I interacted with was the attendant at the mlife desk. She was very helpful polite and informed me of things they had going on. Eataly is fairly expensive so only thing I got there was a croissant which was delicious.  The casino was pretty hopping. It is fairly bright but it is smoky I guess with everything looking so much more modern now I expected the ventilation would be better.  It could also use a vent fan in the toilet area. Location is great and the place was clean I would certainly stay here again.
50,Loved the location plenty of restaurants to choose nearby. All staff members were awesome. The casino was quaint and fun with GREAT music. The arena with Aerosmith was fantastic. Overall good value and we would stay there again.
40,Staying at the PARK MGM was pretty good experience. We would rated them a 10 if we hadn't had issues with checking into the hotel. Unfortunately it took 3 attempts on our own accord. The front desk never called us but overall we would stay again
50,I have read many negative reviews regarding the new check-in procedure and was a bit worried. It was a breeze. Only had one glitch but staff was there in a minute to help. The resort is great. Nice rooms and pool area. Awesome location. And a shout out to the staff who cleaned room 23126 from Oct 4 to Oct 9. Great job ladies. Would recommend this resort and will be back in the future
30,Have stayed before at Monte Carlo. Now Park MGM. All staff from Concierge to security to environmental services to electrical repair were friendly and helpful and seemed to enjoy their work. All very efficient. Rooms and bathrooms were spotless. I was not comfortable with the casino layout or the smoking. Casinos in NY are non smoking with smoking areas separate. I think if the Primrose Restaurant/Bar was open from the swimming pool area it would be more inviting to so many and so convenient. I went outdoors thinking I could sit there and relax and was informed it was not part of the pool environment. Too bad as the chairs/tables looked so comfortable. The halls are long and dark. Wallpaper has very small hummingbirds and dragon flies and is quite pretty once you realize what it is. Otherwise it looks like bugs on the walls. Gnoccis and rigatoni from Eatily were delicious but overall the food in all dining areas was very expensive. It was just as easy to go across the street to Denny's. Over all experience was good. Check in and out was very easy. The few Problems we had were solved within minutes.
40,beautful rooms with great views of the strip or surrounding areas huge tvs great showers & comforable beds. A Stabucks seconds from the elevators & slots even closer if that's your thing. Very nice swimming pools when the weather is nice.
50,Our overall rating for the entire stay at the Park MGM would be a 10 out of 10. Quality value quality service quality personnel. A resort/casino location that in the end makes you want to come back.
50,Probably our 50th time to Vegas last 3 or 4 times have stayed at the new Park MGM. Can't say enough good things about the place. Great location great food choices great rooms and great service all around.
20,Check in and checkout was a hassle. Lobby and hallway to tram smelled like a sewer. Bathroom smelled like a sewer. Not enough towels/ toiletries supplied. Hallway to rooms poorly lit. Carpets were filthy
50,We thoroughly enjoyed our visit and enjoyed all the entertainment we will certainly be back and bring lots of friends and family with us! It was an AMAZING opportunity to get away and experience a wide array of shows and foods
40,The old Monte Carlo has been renovated and is not the MGM PARK. Fun place nice casino. New sports book is more of a sports bar and the Mama Rabbits is more of a hangout for strippers. The eatery in the front is very cool but the price for a domestic bottle of beer is way out of control. $9.50 for a bud lite??? go across the street and get a case at the ABC store.
40,Room was fine. My only complaint would be that I could hear the persons cell phone alarm and ringer in the next room going off so the walls were too thin. Probably not something that could change. Otherwise everything was great.
10,Hard to check-in and out with machines working half of the time. Assistance staff looked less than friendly and overworked. Was also charged for mini bar that couldn`t be located in the room. Hard to believe one of MGM hotels is managed this way.
40,Used to stay here frequently when it was the Monte Carlo. Enjoyed our Stay Well suite with its air purifier special lighting and VERY comfortable bed. Only thing we missed was having a little refrigerator in the room and a coffeemaker. Shower was huge and good water pressure. The couch and chair in the room were especially comfortable as well. Also the artwork in the room was way less cheesy than the usual hotel room decor!!
40,The hotel and rooms are clean and nice ( except for the fact that the bathroom door is also the closet door). The casino has new slot machines but they are kind of tight. Other than that everything was great!
30,Hotel is convenient if you need to jump between Aria City Center and Bellagio or even Cosmopolitan. If you need to attend events at T-Mobile arena and prices are ok. Otherwise the hotel room is meager and don't expect too much. Hopefully your room is closer to the elevators otherwise it will be a very long trek for you to your room.
50,We last stayed here when it was the Monte Carlo and were interested to see how it had changed. We chose a Nighthawk Suite....worth the extra as you get PLENTY of room including a large shower only bathroom and a walk in closet plus two TVs!  We heard no noise at all in our room and there was only one time when there was a long wait for the lifts. Everything was spotlessly clean and it was certainly a great choice for a few nights on the Strip.
10,Park MGM will charge resort fees even when booking with points even though they're not supposed to. They refund it in some cases depending on what customer service you get. When I called to ask for a refund the rep hung up on me when I requested to talk to a a manager.
50,Dustin is the absolute best in the hotel. He is so accommodating and we love him so much. He couldn’t have been more helpful. He is at the front desk as a host. Look out for him if you need any help at all!!!! Thank you dustin for making our trip
20,We had an unauthorised entry into our room who was not the maid or any other hotel employee. They stole nothing but I believe he/she was interrupted before they could. I will not stay here again. I never felt safe after that even in the new room they moved us to since it still was on the same floor.
30,Resort Fee / Food / drinks are outrageous in most of the Las Vegas Hotels. Will think twice about spending my money on my next trip in Las Vegas.Great entertainment and lots to do however Can do more  with less in other cities.
50,Newly renovated and right just off the strip on Park Ave. We had one comp night and a partial so our room overal rate was very reasonable for being close to everything. Also if you're a vet you can get free parking by just signing up for MLife as a Pearl Member.
30,I stayed there for 7 days skip every 2 days for housekeeping as I want to save overall hotel resources. Day 2(1st housekeeping) was a very sloppy job. Counters were not wiped floor mat and other towels were refreshed. The rest of the days were better. The walls are thin. I am woken up by other guests pulling up their blinds.
50,I stayed at the MGM park in October 2019. The place is amazing. As are all the resorts on the strip it was expansive. This is amazing that so many large events happen such as the Aerosmith concert and the nights game. Always something Grand going on in or near the MGM park.
20,"Food is very pricey and late night options limited. Everything is self service unless you are ""VIP"". Night club limited seating unless you pay for table service. Noodle resturant food best option for your money."
40,My husband and I stayed here for 2 nights to celebrate his birthday. We loved the location it was really clean and the staff was great. This was our 4th trip to Vegas together and we agreed it was a nice hotel but there wasn’t anything really special about it. There’s no spectacular pool or theme to make it feel as extravagant as Vegas usually feels. Even so we would stay here again for the right price.
20,"Our upgraded room was down a long dark hallway. NO security & anyone can enter hotel. One evening 2 ""sketchy"" individuals outside our room - we walked around 'til they left to go in room. . Room had no view. No robo-bar or mini-fridge or coffee maker. NO dresser drawers or anything to put your cloths other than small closet with hangers - plan on leaving everything in suitcase during your stay. Couple pricey snacks/water in room at high prices.. We planned hanging out at pool relaxing most of the time. Pool area is among the worst I've encountered 3 small pools about 3.6""-4' deep - 2 small ones and long canal type and forget about swimming due to how shallow & number of people. Now the worst part & forget any thought of relaxing - the MUSIC! Speakers at all 3 pools with loud rock music & a heavy bass beat [THUMP THUMP THUMP!]. Non-stop all day long. 2nd afternoon we fell asleep to both be jolted awake as music volume turned up - HUh? What?? You kidding me?? This was the least relaxing atmosphere imaginable. The ""entry-level"" remark showed in pool area: plastic food trays left poolside on ground beer cans plastic drink cups. Security check at pool - purses etc. & no alcohol can be brought in - therefore premium prices at 2 bars. Poolside bars have bench cushions & lounge chairs heavily stained. Keep receipts from poolside as discrepencies on check-out bill. Park MGM defines ""entry-level"" & next time I'll gladly pay more for Bellagio & stay one night less."
50,Love the location. Just the right size. People are friendly. Eataly is awesome. Rooms are clean and comfortable. Bartenders were friendly. Will be going back in about 6 months. Highly recommend this casino
50,The hotel is very new with great amenities. Guest rooms are set up for all electronics - multiple outlets USB ports etc. Nice views. We especially enjoyed Eataly which is located in the hotel. The pool area is great - a lot of sun and shady areas. Multiple bars.
30,The renovations of what was once The Monte Carlo to the now Park MGM was nice to see... but not great - with the decor being rather boring.  The beds were really comfy & the rooms were extra clean.  The pool area was lovely but they could have kept it open longer.  All Hotel Staff were friendly and accommodating.  We were there for the Aerosmith Concert which was a beautiful venue.  The seating was fantastic so you could see from everywhere.  The sound system was amazing.  We were not thrilled with the Italian Eatery AT ALL! :(
50,Perfect location on the strip especially if you are attending an event at T Mobile arena. Staff is friendly and helpful newly remodeled rooms are very comfortable several options at their multiple pools.
10,resort fees are horrible high. check in process is very long and complicated. bell department is way under staffed. had to wait 45 minutes to get our bags taken to valet. on hold for 20 minutes waiting for a hotel operator
20,We had no cleaning service for the first two days even after I asked about it twice. This made our stay unsatisfactory in itself. Staff was courteous but very disorganized. Work is needed to get procedures better so guests can relax and enjoy their time in Vegas. As this was our first visit I will stay somewhere else next time and tell my friends to do the same.
50,Had a nice meal at La La Noodle a bit a gambling drinks at Mama Rabbit's and then the Aerosmith show! What an evening. Will be back! MLife is the best! They did a wonderful job on the re-design of the entire facility. Arena is a great place to see a show!
50,The room was clean did not have a chest of drawers to store clothes for our 5 days no place to put the ice bucket or glasses.. it was quite got used to the smoke in the casino the second night (on oxygen) we are not big gamblers MLIFE REWARDS FOR VETS ARE GREAT >
40,Our first time to this lovely venue! Great concert great venue. Not sure there’s a bad seat anywhere in the house. All that’s lacking is more food & beverage choices. Food availability was a bag of pretzels or raisenettes. Coming back in 2 weeks too see lady Gaga- I’ll know better what to expect. Loved the Italian eatery inside the hotel!!! What a selection of choices no matter how hungry you are or not.
40,I had stayed at the Monte Carlo several times in the past and didn't recognize it with the refurbishment that had been done. Positives: large room comfortable beds great shower; Eataly - expensive but authentic; four pools (even though they close at 6; nice selection of restaurants. Great location on the strip. Attractively decorated. Negatives: didn't like the barn door they used to close the closet & bathroom with - didn't give enough privacy in bathroom; a fridge would have been nice; more closet space and hangers
40,Celebrated our 25th wedding anniversary. Had total of six night stay (4+2) using back to back reservations from our M Life rewards. Few hiccups throughout our stay but overall loved this hotel. Check in was late at night therefore few people working and could not give us the room we booked. Plenty of self serve stations but we prefer to speak with someone. On day 4 we had to check out/in again with plans to stay in the same room although our room just happened to be closing for renos. The upside was that they gave us a Nighthawk suite which was fantastic and we highly recommend it. They also comped most of our resort fees for the inconvenience also our room was not cleaned one day. Nice gesture. Regular rooms are modern and spacious. The shower was amazing! Regular room was quiet (12-222) suite (19-102) was noisy with the elevator beside it and adjoining room door did not block out noise although not a big deal to us. Rooms have a hair dryer safe and ironing board. There is no coffee maker which we found disappointing because that meant we had to look presentable to hit the Starbucks on main floor conveniently located right at elevators. Don’t lift any items from the box of treats/water etc on counter in room unless you plan on purchasing it because it will time you and you may be charged. We found that Eataly was quite expensive. Casino was small but nice. Downside to the casino was that it was hard to get a drink when you were gambling. We had one offer in 6 days and gambled daily. Other casinos we were offered multiple times within minutes. We had two pool days and loved it! Drinks were expensive (15+ some other fee) but bucket of beer was reasonable. ($45) Uber doors were easy to find. Great location overall some walking but the tram made it easier too. We have stayed at other hotels throughout the strip and they all have their benefits for location. The new pedestrian bridge looked to be very close to completion and this will be a great addition. Hotel staff and security were all very kind and seemed to be appreciative of the business. We had 2 complaints: (1) the regular rooms do not have dressers and there is little room for suitcases. We found out the reason we had to leave our room on day 4 was because dressers were going in and this was because of hotel reviews! (2) the barn door that slides from bathroom to closet is horrible! We started calling out “door” if we were coming out of the bathroom as I almost lost a toe because of it. Hopefully this is the next reno 😉
20,Resort fees parking fees valet fees pay for drinks... Full price bars and restaurants... Park MGM and MLIFE properties just seem to suck the fun out of Las Vegas. I miss Las Vegas from 10 years ago!
40,We had a very nice room with a view of the venue we were in town to visit everyday (T-Mobile Arena) so that was very convenient! But why oh why won't vegas hotels give me a little coffee in my room??? Your options are a 45 minute wait in the hotel Starbucks line or ordering an entire pot of plain coffee to your room for $20+... Coffee Vegas people coffee! I'll spend plenty of money outside of my room still even if you provide this tiny nicety!
10,I didn't get the room with a view that I asked for    I told the girl on the phone that I needed a late check in    They had 2 rooms left and one was on the thirteenth floor which is bad luck    Then the front desk female Catherine charged my card for the entire balance when I told her as soon as I walked up I was paying cash but Catherine wasn't listening to a word I was saying    Then I ran out of tissue in the middle of the night had to get off the toilet call the front desk to ask for some tissue    Last but not least that refrigerator sitting in the middle of the room was very ackward and out of place and I bumped the refrigerator several times it was just sitting in the middle of the floor it should have been in the closet    The bed was very comfortable
50,Newly renovated casino and hotel. Amazing food choices. Nice bars and steakhouse. Food court and a starbucks. Lots of slot machines and table games to choose from. Convenient valet to park your car. Friendly staff...lots of pools...
30,Definitely would like to see a better slot machines and the food court that can be open a bit later on at night pool closed at 6 and had horrible food and drinks overpriced location of the resort was great easy to walk up and down the strip
10,Terrible. Guest service was rude. Room was not anywhere close to other mgm standards. Extremely disappointed on how evrything was handled ween it was brought to there attention. I would not refer anyone here for now
40,Overall it was great. I few bumps but I would go again. I love the location and the theater. We saw Aerosmith and would return to watch concerts. I do wish there were more places to eat 24 hours.  I overall would return.
20,This was by far the worst Vegas resort we have stayed at in the last 20 years. Room decor size quality of furnishings and mattress quality were all substandard. Casino is one of the smokiest and noisy on the strip. Restaurants were over-priced for quality and value. Eatily has promise.
50,Great location. Renovations complete. The rooms have been redone and are nice and comfortable. No fridge in them however. Eataly at the Boulevard entrance to the hotel is a fantastic add. New sportsbook is open and is a lot better place to catch a game now.
50,This has been a remarkable changeover. Millions of dollars spent on a massive  renovation. Some of the old Monte Carlo features still remain (e.g. Chandeliers etc)  but the upgrade is of the highest quality. Marvelous pool area and a superior walkway  tastefully decorated to replace the old shopping area. Rooms have been totally upgraded also. Ideally situated on the strip with easy access to the Bellagio monorail and SDX/Deuce buses. All in all a great hotel/casino to stay or to visit.
40,I would say this place is ideal for being on the strip. The room that I had had a couch about the length of the room against the window that overlooked the pool area it was really pretty. The my only gripe about it is that there were no drawers the sliding door to the bathroom was a bit heavy and no coffee pot hahaha I did have a bit of trouble sleeping or getting comfortable the second night other than that this place is a good hotel. the staff was really friendly as well and very helpful.
50,Attending the Rise Festival. Hotel was good would have liked a coffee pot to have coffee and not have to leave the room or pay $16 for coffee also a mini fridge- I'm a small woman with a small appetite and hate to waste also I get hungry at wierd hours and want the option of saving my leftovers to eat later.
40,Beautiful hotel very friendly staff. Great location on the strip accessible to lots of restaurants and bus line downtown. Casino is very large and adequately ventilated. Check-in on a kiosk was not a warm welcome I prefer a front desk available at all times.
50,Great location for a Vegas stay! This is located very near Vegas hockey at the T-Mobile Arena and the Park Theater hosts great headliners. Awesome restaurants and places to watch Sunday NFL games really close by. Starbucks staff are efficient and super nice in the AM!
50,"The Park MGM offers an enjoyable time; the rooms are new and modern and the staff is without a doubt excellent. The Blackjack dealers are friendly helpful and make gaming (and even losing) an enjoyable time. We do not bet ""big"" and play only at the $5/$10 tables but our business is still much appreciated."
40,The first thing we noticed about this property is how loud the music was played from the casino to the pool. Clearly the atmosphere is conducive to non-stop party. The property is trendy bright and sophisticated and housekeeping was impeccable. There were several restaurants to choose from and we really loved the concept of Eatily! Lavazzo is Coffee perfection and a perfect way to start the day with its lovely pastries. Being a little older than the target clientele we may opt for the Aria or Downtown next trip but we did enjoy our visit! Be prepared to pay for parking unless you gamble enough for Pearl tier or above (Mlife).
50,We stayed here for the Aerosmith concert and the hotel did not disappoint! Zach in check in was incredible and made the experience better for us! We had 3 rooms and the comfortable beds and clean rooms were perf!
30,For being a regular visitor and customer i did not feel like it mattered with questions i asked and the way i was treated while dealing with them. I’m also in a customer service based career and no matter what i make sure my customer is satisfied and taken care of before i leave contact with them..
30,"My husband & I stayed four nights in a Stay-Well room (218). The room was clean and the bathroom was very nice. The room decor was what I would consider ""comtemporary eclectic"".....strange art arrangements but that's not really important. We would have liked more ammenities however such as a coffee-maker & small fridge. Most of all we would have liked a more comfortable mattress! We both found it hard & uncomfortable to the point that we called to see if a pad was available.....no but we can send some blankets. So we padded the mattress with blankets which did help some. Walls were a bit thin for the noisy neighbors. The location of the Park MGM is convenient to many of the shows that we planned to attend. Not particularly fond of the kiosk self check in.....my husband handled that well but I prefer personal service. Like all of the casinos it was smokey even though ventilated so we spent a minimal time in casinos.....mostly passing thru and occasionally stopping on occasion to make our ""donations"". Restaurant choices were excellent but very pricey. We thoroughly enjoyed Bavettes The Primrose & Crack Shack but will review restaurants separately. Even though we didn't wind up eating there it was very interesting shopping at Eataly. Overall the property was adequate and we might stay there again.....but there are so many opportunities to experience in Vegas!"
30,The location is excellent and the casino is very nice. It has a few nice restaurants. The rooms were very poorly designed to the point that I would never stay here again. Severe lack of closet space no real dresser for clothes lousy ironong board no desk in the room and a one piece bathroom/closet door was dangerous and extemely inconvenient.    You would have to see the room to realize how poorly it is laid out but that would require staying in it which I do not recommend that.
10,You are on your own for check in/checkout for this property. The kiosks are frequently not working and you have to struggle to find an attendant to help you. The rooms are standard hotel rooms and are clean.
20,Our family made reservations months in advance to celebrate our dad's 90th Birthday we requested to be all on the same floor but it didn't happen we were all schattered throughout the hotel and different floors and different elevators. Also my sister's hotel room was accessed by an unauthorized person. No longer felt safe after that. The only person that seem to care was a VIP agent named Sandra who helped us out and showed us compassion and respect. With all the different choices in Vegas well choose wisely.
40,Park Mgm is a great area itself and very walkable to North strip -Bellagio for fountains and linq for some other stops we make. I've always had a good sleep when there. Rooms are very comfortable -all the room you need.
20,The Wing of our hotel was facing the setting sun. The wall was so hot that the a/c was set to 63 degrees and would not cool down until 1-3 am in the morning. Blackjack dealer kept taking my side bet before she turned over the cards. I asked her to stop but she kept doing it. I should have called the manager.
30,"The new color scheme is just plain ugly. I think they were going for ""retro"" using multiple shades of green but they missed the mark. The hallways are dark because the greens are almost black. The room was average. Tried to save money in the design...one sliding door for the closet and the bathroom. Plastic shelving for towels. The biggest disappointment was the pool area. The Monte had a great pool area....this is a small run of the mill swimming pool with run of the mill chairs and loungers. The one nice thing were the ""in pool"" lounge chairs. Harrah actually has a nicer pool area now. Will review Eataly venue separately....that is the new multiple eatery venue."
50,My mommy getway with my girlfriend was great. My first 4day trip without my children was just what I needed. My only complaint was waiting in long lines during self check-ins. Hotel was nice lots of good foods to eat.
30,This was my first stay at this new hotel but I had previously stayed when it was called Monte Carlo and I'd enjoyed it.  I like the location and it should be easily accessed assuming there isn't an event at the Arena next door. They use the parking for the hotel but hopefully this will stop once the new arena is finished.  I liked the hotel but for everything I liked there was one thing that should be better.    The layout is simple as it is a smaller hotel but in the lobby there is no traditional front desk to check in. It's all self-check in at kiosks though there were several staff nearby. They did seem to be talking to each other more than assisting guests and I had several issues as the pictures on the computer showed things that were different from my kiosk like when I had to scan my ID.    In the room the entry was very dark but the rest of the room was bright. The air-conditioning was quiet but then that made it easier to hear my neighbors through the thin walls. Turning the fan onto HIGH helped just a little.  I had 2 queen beds one of which was sagging so much I had to switch beds in the middle of the night. They give each bed 4 huge pillows but not a fitted sheet so it kept coming untucked.  The blackout shade for the window was the best I think I've ever had in a Vegas room but the view out the window was poor as they didn't wash the glass on the outside.  There was a lot of music noise coming from the arena as there was a hockey game that night. They play loud music outdoors and it echoed off the face of the hotel. Not a great idea for paying guests to have to hear that. They also should have built overhead pedestrian walkways between the properties. Traffic didn't always stop at the 4-way stop crosswalk. There were several places to eat and drink in the area there called The Park IIRC.    The phone in my room was cordless which was a nice feature however it would not stay in the charging position in its cradle and so had no power. There was no alarm clock in the room. Not sure if that might have been a feature of the phone. The bed lighting was good and there were 2 USB ports and 2 power outlets.    The bathroom was exceptional with great adjustable lighting strong water pressure in the big shower and lots of towels. The only thing I felt was missing was one of those massage features on the shower head!    One weird thing is that the bathroom and the closet in the hallway share the same sliding door. This is a mistake as I was constantly sliding the door to get into one area. There was also no lock on the bathroom section of the door.  The closet was half taken up by a chest of drawers. Not sure why it was in there as that cut the amount of clothes that could be hung in half. If 2 people were staying they wouldn't be able to hang all their clothes. Maybe this is a room for just one person? But when why 2 beds? There was also no in-room refrigerator.    There was a nice long sofa along the window; long enough to sleep on. However there was no chair to sit at the table...    When I took a taxi to get to the Mirage we were held up by the many people directing traffic into the parking structure presumably because of the hockey game. They had us stopped for about 5 minutes while they waved traffic into the parking structure so my taxi couldn't leave even though there were several times when we should have been waved through.    I enjoyed the new pool area. I took a swim in the long pool which was probably 100 feet long and had salt water so no bad chlorine smell. But there was no outdoor shower that I could find to rinse off after my swim...    So you see this hotel seems to have been designed by someone who has never stayed there. This could explain the missing or incomplete features that an MGM property should have.  I ate at 3 of the restaurants Primrose La La Noodle and Bavette's. All were good though a bit expensive but I'll review them on their own pages.
30,Second visit. We were expecting much more from this property since our first visit they were under construction. Not happy with the overall feel of this hotel. Staff was very friendly but not knowledgeable. It felt like it was everyone’s first day on the job. After 2 visits here we will not return.
50,We've been coming to Las Vegas for 30 years and have stayed at almost every MGM property. We've stayed at The Park on several occasions even before when it was The Monte Carlo. I have to say they've really stepped up their game. The remodel looks very nice...great rooms good check in experience. The dealers have always been very friendly at this property. Nice job MGM!
50,Awesome comfortable rooms very clean. Pool area is very nice. Great service and comfortable chairs. Check in is super easy. Big TVs in rooms you can order room service from the TV. Will always choose to return
30,We've stayed here several times both as the Park MGM and as The Monte Carlo. Most recently I was a little discouraged to find there is no longer a check in counter you are expected to do all the work yourself on a self serve kiosk. There's probably twenty plus machines and one person to help if you need it. After running into a few glitches on their kiosks and having to wait for the one person to come over and help it was becoming quite annoying. It's not like I am computer illiterate but I'm not going to hit OK to something saying my bill is twice what it's supposed to be.  The room was nice and spacious and is everything I expect it to be. I often use a garbage can for ice (those buckets are way too small) and was surprised to find that the one I had filled with ice was the only garbage can in the room. The beds were comfy and we all slept well. The shower even after pointing it away from the door still managed to leak water all over the bathroom floor. Not a big problem as I just used all the towels to sop it up but something that should be addressed.  When we went to check out we had an issue on our bill as it had a $9 in room purchase. We are savvy travellers and know that those little trays of water and goodies are sensitive to your removal. I removed the price list and read it (you have 60 seconds to put back anything you've removed before you are charged for it) and so I knew better than to remove any of the products. Yet it wanted to charge us $9. Pressing the help button on the self serve kiosk did nothing. After waiting 5 minutes my wife left me and our luggage to try and find the one person that is available to help travellers with the kiosks. Did I mention that we checked in at 3pm and checked out at 11 am? The same time as hundreds of other guests. The same rush that happens at the same time every day. When we were finally able to secure help we were helped quickly and efficiently at a small counter. Please bring back a check in counter or provide more people to help with the check in or check out process. There were stanchions and a line up to use the kiosks but it was barely noticeable and was not adhered to in any manner.  Will I go back? Very likely. We like the location and have become quite familiar to the layout and amenities. The price is reasonable in comparison to the other casinos and the frustration we experienced checking in and out here is just indicative of the way things are going at all the other casinos. They are all cutting staff to maximize their profits and as long as they are selling out regularly see no need to improve.
30,The rooms were very disappointing I was expecting modern rooms and the only thing that was updated was the bed and shower. I felt like it was walking into the 60s. The bathroom was somewhat updated. But the room itself wasn’t. It was disappointing
50,Hotel was newly remodeled. Had no problem checking in with the kiosks. Great location on the strip. Excellent restaurants. No issues getting our free play or free food money. Staff was great. Would definitely recommend for anyone looking for budget minded stay for excellent service and location
50,Was a great experience. Went on comps and enjoyed it very much. Night hawk suite was nice. Restaurants are so good. Crack shack and la la noodles was amazing. Prices decent. Casino very organized and clean. Pool AreA really nice but drinks are crazy pricy( ouch)...
40,Love the central location. Had a 'Stay Well' room which was cool but some of the stuff was just confusing to use or didn't work (shower infuser). Friendly staff nice salon (had a manicure) and fitness center.
50,This was my seventh time staying at this property-- never had a bad expierience--serve is amazing...can't say enough anout this location. Close to shopping ( Ross Marshalls etc) across the street. The arena a 2 min walk!! Great venue/ pool area well kept. Beds are really comfortable. Tram to Bellagio is coneected through back of casino...Just Luv this place and recommend to all my friends that go to Vegas !!!
30,there is a loud nightclub on the second floor that can be heard all the way up at least to the 21st floor. If you need to get to sleep I suggest that you get a room on the arena side of the hotel if you can. The rooms are cozy and beds are comfortable but the walls are paper-thin. I don't believe they paid much attention to that when they remodeled from the Monte Carlo.
30,The room was really nicely decorated and furnished but we could hear noise from next door. Whenever somebody adjusted the curtains in any of the surrounding rooms (chain pulley) it sounded like somebody was drilling into our wall. Not pleasant at 2:00 am. The pool was really great and didn’t have a problem finding a place to lay down. The check in process was clunky due to self check in machines that didn’t show our comped nights. It took about 5 minutes to flag down a staff member for assistance.
50,Great location with lots of food options shows and Casinos had a nice variety of slots. Beds are great showers are awesome!  Easy to get around in an Uber or Taxi. Close to the airport.  Lots of reasonable shopping close by CVS Walgreens Ross & Sketchers.
20,The rooms have NO drawers. Hallways are dark and gloomy. We stayed for 5 nights and living out of a suitcase was annoying. We were told none of the rooms have dressers not even Nomad. Do yourself a favor and chose another hotel.
40,Rooms are small but not bad just don't expect them to be above average. Clean and convenient. Eataly is a neat place inside. Was told a strip view but received a backside pool view. The self check-in is ok but not exceptional.  The property is in a good location. Music is a bit loud throughout facility and outside of building but hey its Vegas.  Overall not bad and the convenience of location is great right on the strip with easy access to lots of places.  During NHL games it does get congested though and was hard to get back to hotel with share rides during the event since roads were blocked off around area.
30,Stayed here because they were offering a great deal through united but the food credits that were promised were not included in my final bill and I had to call four times times before they were properly included. Service at some of the restaurants was poor no coffee machines. Overpriced food. They tried for trendy decor in the rooms but felt kinda shabby and old considering it’s supposed to be new. Bathrooms were subpar. Bare bones amenities.
50,The room was very nice. Had there been a room fridge it would have been perfect. I booked a strip view and it was outstanding. Primrose is a must do. The food setting and staff is incredible. Great job by all.
50,The room was clean and bathrooms updated. Bed was comfortable perfect for a catch up nap! We loved the refrigerated air! Entire staff was friendly. It was a great value and we will definitely go back!
40,Stayed at Park MGM instead of Aria for a conference. It was good value for money can walk to Aria and was very happy for free parking to M club member. Enjoyed the restaurants. Checkin and check out was convenient. Staff was helpful. We had a rude guest next door that ruined the trip but the security dealt with it.
10,The location is great and the room was clean - but beyond that I wouldn’t stay here- thin walls - you can hear the people in the next room- bed wS very soft- and the room itself is so small- one sliding door to close the closet and the bathroom- so if you are coming out of the bathroom- hope another person is not using the closet!
50,Everything you want & need all in one place. Great location on the strip. Good variety of food & drinks in the resort. Nice pools. Perfectly appointed rooms with plenty of power & usb outlets next to beds & couch in room. Nice shower with good pressure. Room was dark & quiet at night. Very comfortable bed & pillows.
40,I had a good stay in this hotel..if your looking for something central and near strip this hotel will suit..there is a free tram to bellagio/crystal shop..as ever there are nice restaurants and bars in this hotel..but being Vegas there are lots of options close by as well..I would happily stay in this hotel again.
50,The staff at Park MGM went above and beyond to ensure that we had the best possible experience during our stay. Any concerns are quickly and professionally addressed and the rooms are clean comfortable and tastefully decorated. Their central location provides easy access to many of the strips hot spots and it's affordability makes it one of Las Vegas' best kept secrets.
20,Hotel/Rooms are outdated and need renovation. Food in Eatery was outrageously priced. Access to boulevard wasn’t convenient. We could hear music from nightclub in our room. Parking was great and easy to access.
20,I had read other reviews about the room not being properly cleaned. I thought what are the odds. Sure enough there was an empty beer can left on the dresser. This sets the stage to wandering what else was missed. The sheets were clean but stiff and uncomfortable. There long past due for replacement. The room had a nice Motel 6 decor. All of the casinos have some degree of smokiness but this one is the worst. Very poor ventilation. There's a lot of options in Vegas. Skip this one.
40,Overall it was nice. Great location for Knights games. Room facing the strip was very noisy even from the top floor due to party music on the Strip. Resort fees and parking added a third to the bill.
50,Clean room and comfy beds. I loved the size of the room and the fact that I could gather with all my friends in the room because of the amount of seating. Parking is a little costly but I was able to avoid the cost by using my M-Life membership. Also I really loved Best Friends and Eataly. The cabana their do need better curtains or fabric. They seemed very worn out from the sun. Overall a nice stay
30,Disappointed in the rooms as there is very little closet and drawer space . Disappointed in the casino as the black jack rules (black jacks only pay 6-5) are terrible. Also disappointed in the Sports Bar as it is too small with minimum television sets. I felt like I was at a kiosk in Walmart. Also can not believe that you charge for room safe usage. Enjoyed the new Eatoly restaurant.
40,We were very surprised at how nice Park MGM was. The room was very chic and clean. It has blackout shades that make the room very dark which is perfect for sleeping. The shower/bathroom was very clean. The water was very hot in the shower and there was plenty of pressure. We loved the location next to the Park outside. Nice place to just relax & sit at a table day or night. The casino was very nice. There were several $10 & $15 Blackjack tables & they weren't crowded. The only thing we didn't like was the lack of security when getting into the elevators to get to our room. There is no security guard monitoring who gets in & no room key is needed to get to any of the floors. I didn't feel very secure when riding the elevator myself. Overall we we definitely return to this hotel.
10,My husband is disabled & we called for assistance to help carry our luggage down front desk directed me to belldesk phone. They never answered. So we went to bellhop station to get a luggage cart. They told us they were on break for 30 more minutes & that we couldn’t even use a luggage cart because they were union so no one but them could touch the luggage carts! We had to leave within 30 minutes for the airport so me & my severely disabled Husband had to struggle to get our luggage to the front doors for taxi driver to help us. There’s just no excuse for this type of treatment of anyone especially older disabled people. So I wouldn’t recommend this place for anyone unless you can carry everything yourself with no help whatsoever!!!
40,"Overall the Park MGM was a very good hotel and I would definitely stay again but as you will find in all hotels there were a few negatives and some things that could use improvement.  We arrived around noon on Sunday and the lobby wasn't very busy at all. All 18 check-in kiosks were up and working. We went to an available kiosk right away and ""checked-in"". We had a question about the resort fees and deposit so we pushed the help button. Only 2 employees were working in the area so we waited about 10 minutes before someone was able to answer our questions. We were told our room wasn't ready just yet (which was totally fine as check-in time wasn't until 3 PM) and that we would be texted and emailed a code once our room was ready and that we were to enter the code in the kiosk then to get our room keys. No problem.  We dropped our bags at the bell desk and left to get some lunch and explore the strip.  We never received a code by text or email but returned to the hotel around 5:00 to check-in. The lobby was PACKED. Only three kiosks were working. The line to wait for a kiosk was very long. People were irate that out of 18 kiosks only so few were available to use. I asked a staff member what we should do as we had already ""checked-in"" early. She told us to go to the VIP desk next to the kiosks in the lobby. The line at the desk was very short compared to the nightmare happening at the kiosks. After a quick 10 minute wait we had our keys are were ready to head upstairs. I think that the self-check-in is a great option but feel that there should be a traditional Front Desk available to those who prefer to speak to someone to check-in. I bet a lot of people standing in the kiosk line could have checked-in at the VIP desk but didn't because the desk is labeled ""VIP"". I wouldn't have gone up there if a staff member hadn't told us to.  The guest elevators are quick and we were at our room in no time. We had a Nighthawk Suite on the 14th floor. Our room was right by the elevator which was nice because we didn't have to walk at all to get to the room but bad because we got some elevator noise. My husband is hearing impaired so he couldn't hear it but I could until I turned on some white noise to sleep.  The suite is very large and nicely appointed. The hotel seems to be going for a mid-century modern minimalistic look which is great but it doesn't photograph very well. The furnishings and fabrics are very nice and lux in person but it doesn't translate to photos or videos very well. We really liked our room but felt that there was A LOT of wasted space. The bathroom was bright and clean and wonderful but again a lot of wasted space. Also there is the card they always have in hotel bathrooms requesting that you hang-up your towels to reuse to conserve energy but there was literally nowhere to hang up our towels. No hooks or towel bars at all. The only place we could hang our towels was on the handicap railings. It was very strange and maybe just an oversight in our room.  The bed was very comfortable and cozy although it was lower to the ground than we were used to. The closet was big and included a dresser a safe hangers and a full-length mirror. I do think the instructions for the mini-bar need to be more prominent. My husband picked up a few items to look at them and we ended up being charged for them at the end of our stay because he didn't realize they were on a sensor. The staff at the VIP desk removed the charges with no problem but it still wasn't very clear at the minibar.  Our view from the room was of the T-Mobile Arena and part of the NYNY roller coaster. We heard the coaster a few times but that wasn't an issue for us. There was a hockey game at the arena our first night there and when the Golden Knight's scored a goal a very loud horn sounds outside the stadium. We had just gotten to our room when it went off for the first time and we had no idea what it was! I took us by surprise but we quickly figured it out and actually watched part of the game from the window of our room on the jumbotron on the outside of the Arena.  All in all the Park MGM is a great hotel. I don't love the automated check-in and check-out since we had to seek out a staff member at the VIP desk during both of our processes and while I don't feel the niceness and luxury of the hotel shows up in photos it really is a beautiful and upscale hotel in a clean minimalistic way. The location is wonderful. We used the free tram from the Park MGM to the Bellagio many many times. The tram is very convenient and saved us a lot of walking and/or Uber rides! We will definitely visit the Park MGM again!"
20,"1. Pre-checked in via the app and was told my room would be available by 12:00 the next day. Got to the hotel at 12:00. Checked in again via the kiosk and there were no rooms. After 4 hours at 4:00 was told there was still 45 people ahead of me. Waited in the self check-in line twice (there is no live check-in). Self check-in screen said now there was an error on my reservation. Tried to get a real person to help - damn near impossible. Finally grabbed the one customer service agent who helped me get a room (sorry to the 45 people ahead of me). Went to the room and it was occupied by a nice family. Oops. Went back downstairs waited in line AGAIN. Got a new room.    2. Checkout was automated - charges on my bill for hotel restaurant that did not belong to me. Charges for parking but I am a pearl member. Waited in line to dispute. 12 people in line. One agent. Found a person in a suit and asked where I should go to dispute these charges and was told to wait in line. I waited in line. Agent removed the charges. Got home. Checked my credit card and was recharged for both charges. Called the 800 number. Waiting for refund.    3. Impossible to get pool service - went to the bar and was told to wait at my chair for a server. I said there was no server and the bartender literally shrugged at me. Asked the lifeguard (only employee I could find) how much the ""premium"" pool lounge chairs were. She didn't know but said she would check. Then she left and never came back.    4. If you are a light sleeper and it's the weekend be careful of the strip view rooms as the nightclub has a roof top area and the music is pretty loud. Didn't bother me much but I can see how it would be a problem for some.    Nice property great location but something is really wrong in the overall management. Seems very understaffed and the customer service made me never want to stay here again. We go to Vegas a couple times a year. I was excited for this ""new"" place. Oh well."
40,I have stayed here twice since the re-branding to Park MGM and at least 3 times previously as Monte Carlo. I will admit that I am a low roller and not looking for fancy amenities fine dining and spa treatments. Just a solid clean room to sleep and shower. Park MGM seemed to fit the bill perfectly. Both times I received an online check in email prior to arrival. I followed the directions on the email and my room was ready before I even arrived at the hotel. I visited a self-service kiosk that was quite user friendly and provided us the room keys. The rooms are all obviously remodeled in the last couple of years so that was nice. The color scheme isn't crazy just simple. Nice sized tile shower and clean bathroom. The sliding barn door style of bathroom door could be an issue for some people since it doesn't lock like a standard door but wasn't a problem for us. The location provides easy access to the strip and surrounding properties and the parking garage is close to the hotel lobby. I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.
50,Wonderful vacation. Special time with friends attending concerts. Weather was perfect. Park MGM was the perfect location and a wonderful hotel. We will return in a few weeks and so look forward to our next trip.
20,"If you need to do anything other than the norm at check-in good luck. The employees that are there to ""assist"" you are less than helpful. It doesn't seem like they can think outside the box to help with the simplest of requests."
50,"Please don't touch anything and read all ""signs"" after you enter the room. When you knock down anything from the counter put it back to the same area within "" 60 seconds"". otherwise you will be charged."
40,Great place and convenient. Took the Deuce down to Fremont Street. The bus stops In front of our hotel. Had a great time. Visited many places. Have alot of fun on Fremont Street. Spent a full day there.
50,You don’t need to walk a mile from the street to get into the hotel perfect location  clean comfortable rooms. Friendly staff awesome entertainment & it has Eataly which is an amazing food experience 👍🏻
40,Second stay the casino service not good. Waitress don't show up. Rooms are nice and clean. Got the request for strip view. Walls are very thin can hear everything in your joining room. Nice location to walk the middle of the strip.
40,We had a nice short stay at Park MGM as we celebrated our  anniversary. The room is clean we had a nice view. The customer service is very nice. We will definitely recommend this hotel to our family and friends.    thank you!
40,The rooms are average but the restaurants especially Eataly are great! Crack shack is soooo good and the location is prime. The value is high. Live music on Saturday was very good and October fest right there across the street was a very nice touch as well.
10,Please hire some receptionists! a 45 minute self checkout process is simply unacceptable. With a service fee of $37 per night MGM can certainly afford a few additional receptionists to help check in people instead of using their terrible self check in process. I am the guest not the receptionist!
10,When asking to speak to supervisor and elevating concern...accountant person hung up on spouse. Customer service is why I’d come back...I won’t be back. Rooms are mediocre at best...save your money and go somewhere where you will be appreciated.
10,We had to wait almost 2 hours for our room to be ready. While waiting we went to the Primrose Bar. It took a good while for a waitress to take our order but even longer for us do get our drinks (15 min.) We gave up on the order we gave our waitress and went to the bar and orders ourselves. Drinks arrived after we got our own drinks. We received even worse service in the Sports Bar. No one ever took our order not at the table or standing at the bar. We left twice!  After going out to dinner and touring Las Vegas we went to our room to settle in for the night and found we had no bath towels. It took several attempts to get anyone to answer the phone and the front desk. When I did finally get through and tell them we had no towel it took 45 minutes to get towels delivered to our room.  Our room had no where to unpack our clothes no dresser not drawers at all! We didn't even have a luggage rack. I ended up using the ironing board as a luggage rack which I had to take out of the afterthought Ikea style closet in our room just to hang our clothes.  Our Aerosmith concert was canceled 2 hours before showtime. Bummer! So we went looking for a place to sit and listen to music. No luck! There was a fabulous rock bank playing in the casino but no where to sit and enjoy them. Some of us ended up standing the whole time we listened. We ended up leaving the hotel everyday to find entertainment.  We did however have an excellent meal and service at the Bavette Dinner house with one complaint. We were asked if we wanted water regular or sparkling. We said we just wanted regular water. Our glasses were kept full all evening. Our disappointment came when the bill arrived. $36 for water. REALLY? We didn't ask for bottled water or for all the refills. There was even an almost full bottle left on our table when we left.
50,Great place to stay excellent view great location easy to get around you can be a walker our a rider and it's still easy to get around I didn't see any violence or negative behavior everyone was just having fun
50,Overall experience was great. Rooms are nice and clean and bigger than expected. Staff was helpful and friendly. Getting a taxi is easy. Monorail is nearby. Short wait to checkin or use self service checkin and checkout.
20,We were in Vegas to see the Eagles Concert and a little vacation. After having a Wonderful Experience at the Nomad we had to change rooms for our last night in Vegas and checked into the Park MGM. What can a say other than what a let down. Dark Dark hallways - No 24 hour staffed Desk. Rooms reminded me of a motel. Most important note - Never let them give you Room 221 on the Fourth Floor. Air conditioning unit cycled and made noise All night long. Open the shade and you get a glorious view of all the air conditioning units for the building! Needless to say would not stay there again! Thankfully it was one night!
50,We swung by this hotel on a Tuesday night and it was BUMPIN'. The casino was lively and very entertaining.  We returned the next day and took the free 11am craps lesson. Shawn was a blast and we learned great tips from him. Later that evening we all played craps with his tips had a great time and won some money! We also walked around the hotel peeked into the pool etc... This isn't the fanciest hotel on the strip but it is still beautiful and nice. I enjoyed the simplicity of it. If this hotel was anywhere else it would be considered 4-5 stars and VERY nice. I think the other hotels just overshadow it.
10,This establishment did nothing to help us with our problem they dropped the ball several times. After a couple hours in our room waiting for someone to fix our problem they finally sent someone up and it wasn’t because they were busy it was because this Customer Service simply didn’t care they didn’t even tell us that we didn’t need to be in our room when maintenance arrived.
50,We were in Vegas to attend the Eagles Concert at the MGM Garden Center. The Park MGM was close and in a great location. The hotel is very clean staff was very helpful and the location is close to many restaurants and shops. Eateley is the attached Italian Market was awesome fun place to grab some food or drink. Will definitely stay there again
50,My family and I loved staying here the pools we’re great On the record club was an amazing experience. There was so much to do with so little time Will definitely be coming back to stay here.🤩🤩👍🏽👍🏽
40,This was our first stay at Park MGM since it was last the Monte Carlo.    Check in sucked. I did the pre check in the night before through the app. Then when our flight landed it asked me to check in again and it would tell me when our room was ready. It never did so we checked our bags at the bell desk. Went and grabbed lunch now it was almost 3 and we still hadn't heard about our room so we went towards the check in kiosks. We checked in there and our keys were ready...it didn't make a lot of sense.    Rooms were clean and comfortable the beds were super comfy.    The bathroom layout was nice and the shower was amazing.    If you are looking for quiet rooms then this is not the hotel to stay at. You can hear everything that happens in the room next to you. We could even hear the neighbors when they put their blinds up and down. So if you can hear that than you know what else you can hear. This is kind of unacceptable.
50,Enjoyed every aspect of Park MGM The rooms are comfortable easy accessibility to food and entertainment. Pleasant staff in all areas. Would definitely recommend to friends and family and definitely stay here again
40,Fantastic!!! Great new renovation. Nice rooms and friendly service.Safe location was okay 15 minutes from Las Vegas centre strip. Great casino and pool area was relaxing and contemporary. There was also a Lady Gaga store showing off her costumes shoes and wigs.
50,Booked a 2 night stay here for 2 reasonsone had never stayed here and the other was so my wife could relax on her birthday.It turned out to be a wonderful experience for both of us.We will definitely be back on our return to Vegas.
50,Excellent Hotel great location. We had great views very comfortable bed and the room was very good. Primrose and Lala Noodle restaurants at the hotel were amazing. Eately was the best dinner we had in Vegas!! Highly recommend
50,We highly recommend staying at Park MGM. Staff was very helpful and some went out of there way to help. Rooms and the views were amazing. Perfect location on the strip for walking or using monorail or tram. Having a glass of wine and relaxing in Eataly was wonderful.
40,Good pools (3 of them) with plenty of loungers. Music a little loud maybe one could be more chilled. Location is perfect for the strip. Area outside great to sit out and enjoy the live music between hotel new york. Rooms ok Shower brilliant. Main issue with rooms is the noise from other rooms they require far more sound proofing. I think we were lucky most of the time but you can here everything your neighbours are doing. Helpful Staff would return.
30,I had an amazing time in Las Vegas! I would love to come back but I more than likely will not stay at your hotel. I was injured in your room. Whoever designed the bathroom/closet door was not a very good engineer. What happened was I was doing my hair getting ready to go out on the town and finished up as I was walking out of the bathroom my boyfriend was getting ready also and needed his dress clothes from the closet. I had the bathroom door entry open as I was walking out of the bathroom he opened the closet door and my foot was cut and very bruised being hit by the heavy door. I was unable to wear my heals I brought to wear with my outfit for Saturday night and was very disappointed. Therefore needed to change my whole outfit and wear my tennis shoes that night.  Other than that your hotel is very nice.
40,Park MGM is the refurbished renamed Monte Carlo and MGM did a great job with it.    Check-in experience: super simple and fast using kiosks in the lobby.  Room: i had a king room and found it quite spacious- but that was at the expense of storage. The room had a bed sofa plus a table and chair and still felt uncluttered. But the “dresser” was just a two drawer end table in the small closet. It was fine for just me but would have been a problem for 2 people. There were plenty of plugs and USB ports something I always need. The bathroom had only one sink but the shower was huge. No tub but who really uses one anyway? The bed sat low to the ground and looked and felt almost like a futon. I found the comfort to be OK but not great. Overall the room more than met my needs.  Housekeeping - the room was always very clean. Attention to detail wasn’t always top notch as they forget to replenish shampoo and soap twice and took away the bath mat once. Here I’m looking mainly for cleanliness and they definitely hit the spot in that regard.  WiFi- The wifi was excellent. I measured 10/10 speeds (which is good compared to other Vegas hotels) and never had a problem.  Resort features- I usually use the fitness center and pool but did not on this trip so I have nothing to offer in that regard.  Location- Park MGM is toward the southern end of the strip adjacent to T-Mobile Arena so if you’re in town for a Knights game or other event it’s perfect.  Other features- My gambling is pretty much restricted to the Sportsbook and I did not like the one here. It’s really a sports bar so if you watch a game be prepared for a food and drink bill. I always bet and watch games at Excalibur which is nearby. Yes I know they probably haven’t shampooed the rug since the first Bush presidency but the chairs are comfortable and they don’t charge you to sit down. I did not find a restaurant at Park MGM that looked appealing but you don’t need to go far in Vegas for a meal. I had breakfast next door at NYNY each day.  Overall value- I paid about $100 a night (plus the getting out of hand resort fee) and I think that it’s now my favorite of the non-luxury hotels on the strip. It’s not the Venetian Wynn or the Bellagio but in the same price range I preferred my room and the hotel in general to Treasure Island Mirage Planet Hollywood and NYNY.
50,Had a fabulous stay at Park MGM. It was located near a ton of restaurants inside and outside of the hotel. It was also very clean with an awesome staff. My conference was actually at the MGM Grand so I was originally concerned about the walk but it was so easy to walk that way that I enjoyed the short walk and got to make some fun stops along the way.
50,Our first visit to Park MGM was a pleasant surprise. Even though the check in kiosks were not working correctly our 12th floor room was quiet and had a great pool view. If you want to get rest at night (great blackout curtains) yet still have a casino available then Park MGM should be considered. We LOVED being connected to Eataly as well...just convenient!
40,Park MGM is a nice refresh of the Monte Carlo- very nicely done. They went with a retro decor in many areas and rooms were 60’s ish stylistically with a solid color (tomato red in our case) trimmed throughout. Numerous self check in kiosks and helpful staff made arrival and checkout easy. The restaurants and pool amenities were pretty nice along with the casino area albeit smaller in size with respect to other gaming facilities. I personally like somewhat smaller venues which afforded a more quaint yet not quite boutique feel. Other distinguishing amenities included the “Eataly” food area with all manor of Italian street fare from wine to cannoli and everything in between. Great proximity to T-mobile arena. We also were attached to a tram that linked us to the Aria and Bellagio resorts. This was exceeding convenient in shuttling us home after miles of walking through out the day. From a room comfort perspective - I found the beds to be too soft for my taste and they were about 24” off the floor- rather low. Our rooms were significantly less in price than other places on the strip so it was a good value in my opinion.  All in all a very pleasant stay.
10,Our room was broke in to and the staff was not helpful. We’ve stayed here 5 times and will never go back. Don’t risk your safety and find another resort. The lack of support during this traumatic experience was simply unacceptable. Worst customer service I’ve ever experienced
20,We booked our weekend through the MLife site for the new Nomad Hotel which is supposed to be the newest and nicest. When we got there they put us in the Park MGM which is much older. Even though we booked the reservations at the same time our friends got into Nomad and we didn't. We were assured by the front desk we were in one of the nicer suites but it didn't remotely come close to the rooms in Nomad plus we were immediately next to the elevators. Our room was old very dated and we had to turn the AC all the way down to 60 degrees to get it remotely close to a sleeping temperature in the room. It felt like a total bait and switch.
20,"The drink service in the casino was the worst I've ever experienced. Even the staff (at both the craps table and the blackjack tables) acknowledged that the service is terrible. Too many really great hotels in Vegas to stay at the Park. I got a ""deal"" to stay there would not stay there again for any price."
50,My stay at the Park was outstanding food great visit On the Record maybe one of the best night clubs on the strip. The rooms were clean and comfortable restaurants had a great food options. Come Visit
50,Great location and Great Venue to see a show. We loved the Park Theater and look forward to going back for more shows. We were a bit dissapointed with the quality of food at the Eataly but the concept was cool. Staff was friendly in hotel and the tram to the Bellagio was wonderful as well.
50,Great environment and the staff was very friendly. The location is in a prime area and access to entertainment was great. I highly recommend Park MGM LV. Their sports book is tied into a bar and not like traditional sports book. Very modern look and feel.
30,We spent three nights at Park MGM (former Montecarlo) at a discounted fare thanks to Mlife Membership.  This is among the least expensive and relatively new hotels on the Strip. The Luxor and Excalibur for instance are cheaper but defintely older. This is a good deal if you want to saty on the strip.  We were given a standard room on the 15th floor. fairly big with king bed and sofa and a big bathroom. No refrigerator not microwave. However there was the hair dryer. Still for what they charge a fridge would have been the very least to find in the room.  The hotel is big very big although not as dispervive as the Caesar's or the Bellagio. There are three small pools clustered between the hotel tower and the Aria so some parts of the pool are always in the shadow. The cleaning staff is obviously downsizeed our room was often not done before 3-4 PM.  The free tram to the Bellagio Hotel is very convenient and there's also easy access to the NYNY.  Of course I do not like the resort fees all hotels have been charging recently way too expensive for what they offer and considering you still have to pay for parking separately.  It's not that I'm not suggesting this hotel I also think it has a better price - quaity ration that other more sofisticated hotels. Just be aware of the downsides as well.
50,We stayed at the park MGM bc we were seeing Aerosmith. Which was an amazing concert! Went to the lobby restaurant Primrose and had a great conversation with the mgr (Ray it May be spelt wrong) she was so amazing and offered great places to eat off the strip for other options. She opened a small bottle of Monet for us try as another option for my Veuve addiction (haha). She was such a pleasure to speak to!! Loved her!
20,We went to vegas for our honeymoon and I booked the Park MGM for one night through our free vegas apps. We were supposed to get a discount but the hotel room still cost us over $150 for one night and it’s not a nice hotel. The check in process took forever because the systems were malfunctioning so after my third try someone finally came to help. The room was okay and not comfortable. The worse part was that my husband left his wedding suit in our room and the hotel only has an email address to send a message to so we could retrieve it. We still haven’t heard back from them and it has been three days. Horrible customer service. We will never stay there again.
50,The hotel is as good as all the other high-end ones but their staff is genuinely the best!  I loved their attitude from arrival to the end of our stay.  The VIP staff the bar the restaurant even the security guys...all super great.
20,Lack of secure room floors(keys not needed) and rooms make it that neither I or my friends would ever stay here again. The friends I joined room lock was unsecured for 6 hours and no one from the hotel checked.  Needless to say they got robbed.
20,Prior to check-in they say you'll receive a notice to pre-checkin. Nope. Check-in is unassisted via kiosk. There is no front desk. I was to have a dining credit applied to my stay and it was not issued. With no front desk to inquire about this to I will now have to spend time trying to figure out how to correct this. Will NOT stay here again.
30,The rooms at this hotel are ok. They need to remodel the hallways and elevator. The carpet was dirty. The lighting was too dark. The service was great. Rooms were just ok. Hotel is in a great location. It was good that it connected to the Aria. The club in the hotel was pretty good.
50,We stayed at the Park MGM to attend Aerosmith at the Park Theatre. The hotel and room were simple but well maintained and satisfactory. The hotel was all inclusive - really no need to leave! The bar and restaurant staff were attentive and courteous especially Gustavo at the bar in Bavetts restaurant (hard to get reservations but you can sit at the bar for full service dinner). Planning on going back in November for Lady Gaga!
50,We decided at the last moment to have a fun weekend in Vegas meeting up with friends for her Birthday. They stayed at the Hard Rock we chose Park MGM for the price and the close proximity to Aria Cosmo and MGM Grand. We really had the most wonderful time from the pools to the club to the walking distance to all the best casinos. Our room was cool and it was a good vibe!!
40,Just a liitle above average. Eataly is great but not many excellent choices besides it. NoMad is difficalte to get into. Goood experience checkin in and out. Good veraety of slot machines on the casino floor.
50,Easy check in and check out. Convenient location for the MGM Park Theater. Friendly and helpful staff. Great M life rewards. The Park MGM gives active duty military and veterans great discounts. The casino appears to have really good odds.
40,Most staff was excellent except for bartender at Moneyline and the hostess at La Pasta/Pizza. Except for the diff in room price at the hotel compared to my itinerary I would probably stay there again.
50,Great Hotel with great restaurants and of Great hotel in the heart of Vegas and of course Aerosmith!! The gaming is great and the rooms are amazing.    Eataly is an amazing Italian eatery with so many options.
30,My friends and I stayed here to attend a concert. It was very convenient before and after the concert.  Check-in is self service. Unfortunately the room took forever to be ready and when we got to the room it smelled like cigarette. My husband found ashes on the table. How clean is the room? MGM had technical difficulties with their system on and off.  Eataly is conveniently located by the entrance. Plenty of food choices. Not as big as the Chicago location.  Juniper Cocktail Lounge had a fun DJ and out of the ordinary cocktails. Eric Hernandez and another band member from Bruno Mars came and hung out after the concert.
40,Rooms were very clean and the hotel is conveniently located. Phone did not work and flashed a bright white light constantly. Staff was notified but no one repaired it during our 4 night stay. Lots of security staff and housekeeping but little service staff. We were there for an Aerosmith concert which was cancelled 30 minutes before doors opened. Staff was overwhelmed with refunds and questions at the box office.
50,The check in staff was so friendly and I liked how we could check out on my phone. The rooms were amazing (only wish they had fridges) and the beds were SOOO comfy. It’s always expensive to stay on the strip but I feel like we got our money’s worth. Would not recommend the sit down restaurant at eatily - was extremely overpriced for extremely mediocre food.
10,Not quality for the price and the resort fee. Dark dreary rooms. No amenities no refrigerator no coffee had to pay for the room safe bathroom was so so cheap tin towel rack no wow factor. Pool was good though great staff.
50,We stayed one night because our flight was cancelled. Wish we would’ve stayed here the entire week. Would come back in a heartbeat. The roomservice and amenities were amazing. Great location and great views of the city.
40,Went for a 40th brithday bash. The Park was a great location and a nice hotel staff were nice and rooms were great too. We enjoyed our stay. Best thing to do is go to walgreens and get all our booze from there.
50,We stayed at the Park MGM because we were attending a concert there. The rooms are newly remodeled comfortable and clean. The Conceirge and Bell Hop personnel are very helpful. You can take a free tram from here to the Bellagio with seveal stops along the way. Lots to do in this area with out needing a car.
20,NIce hotel with a few lacking features no coffee pots in the rooms no 24 hour food available. Had major issues with the lock that took almost an hour to resolve. Had to wait in the lobby of my floor no chairs to sit on.
30,nice upgrades for the casino & restaurant renos... needs more attention to detail in the Staywell rooms. ... they should provide bathrobes and slippers in statywell rooms and explanations of how to you equipment & blinds to be more modern (electronic like the ARIA)
40,Park MGM is recently renovated (the old Monte Carlo). They did a great job updating and modernizing. The rooms are nice with clean lines and comfortable beds. The staff were all friendly and helpful. My only note for people looking to stay here is the restaurants in the resort aren't cheap and the line for Starbucks is always long. But I'd stay here again.
30,Was here for business for eight days. Bed was uncomfortable. Housekeeping did not do a very good job. The restaurant selection is very poor here. I’ve been to Vegas a lot. Don’t plan to stay at the park MGM again.
40,Have no other casinos in Vegas to compare MGM to. This was my first trip to Vegas If I get offers for free rooms again I would certainly consider staying here again. I live way over on the East Coast.
40,We stayed at the Park MGM from 17-20 September as part of our 50th birthday celebrations before flying down to Mexico.    Check-in was super easy and quick and we were guided through the self check-in screens. Check out was even easier!    We had adjoining rooms and with the connecting door open made it feel like a large suite. The beds were super soft and the bathroom was lovely. We were on the 27th floor and had lovely views of the strip. Admittedly there was no fridge or tea/coffee making facilities but we had read about this before arriving so wasn’t an issue for us.    We used the monorail between the Park MGM and Bellagio a couple of times and it did save your feet ;) plus it was free!    The casino was spacious and clean as was the pool area - although the water was a little cold.    All in all a clean hotel with friendly staff and a good location for what we wanted to do.
10,Came with another couple for the Eagles concert. From the moment we arrived the customer service was horrible. For starters you have to. check yourself in. If you wanted to try to coordinate staying close to your friends during your stay it won’t happen. When making the reservations we requested they stated they could not guarantee but they would make a note and suggested that we ask at the time of check in. Well there is no one to ask. The check in available is self check in. We arrived to our room and quickly realized that the entire room had a severe cigar type smell. Since there is no front desk I called the “front desk” to you let be greated from a call center. Described The situation and I was informed that they had nothing else available for the type of room that I paid for. I had an upgraded room and they had nothing left. I asked what other rooms were available and she stated that it would be the same fee but I could be downgraded because they have no other rooms available. I had said that would be fine but then my request was if I could be on the same floor as our friends rooms. That too was not an option because they Supposedly had nothing available. She informed me she would have to check with the manager and call me back requested that I stay in the room and tell she was able to call me back. Long story short we did not get a discount on our room we were removed and told to go to a different room which was fine but the inconvenience and a downgraded room with absolutely nothing to accommodate the inconvenience was truly unacceptable. The customer service was horrible from the moment we walked in to the time of trying to find another room. I was told it was so difficult because we were staying four nights five days and that’s what made it so difficult to find another room available. Considering what we paid for the room you would expect better customer service
40,What a great little Hotel little by Vegas standards. However it was nice not navigating a huge casino every time you want to leave for the day or while dragging your luggage to your room. Plus we found the area and surrounding hotels quite desirable. Plus the monorail that takes you down to the Bellagio is very handy.    Eatily was a nice eatery for Breakfast or lunch and the Pantry restaurant was pretty good as well for regular food.    The rooms were pretty basic but the bed was comfortable and the shower large with great water pressure.    The biggest disappointment is probably the pool area which is quite small and plain. However a plain pool seemed to keep people away as it was quite empty most of the time.    We would definitely stay here again.
50,We had a great time at Park MGM. Let’s talk about the room updates the cleanliness of the hotel the friendly staff the gambling AND Eataly. Everything about this hotel was a winner. The valet + bell staff were great. For a foodie who doesn’t engage in much drinking - new experience for me. And when I (finally) chose a wine wow. The bartenders were friendly let me taste the wines and held great convos. Five star experience. Everything was so boujee. I loved it. The coffee shop (Terazza) was GREAT! The line moved quickly the coffee was excellent the service matched. The butcher shop + gelato/crepe stands were outstanding. The butcher shop <heart eyes> and the cheese station in Eataly...stunning. Immaculate. The cuts were beautiful in every sense of the word. Super impressed. Great stay.
40,My friend and I recently had 3 nights at the Park. It is right on “the Strip” opposite the Hard Rock Cafe - an easy walk to visit the other resorts like the Bellagio (to see the fountain show). There is a lovely feel to the hotel the eatery is based on an Italian theme. The food in this area was delicious! The Concierge staff were very helpful when we needed to book a tour or a show (especially Gary). Our room was very clean modern and spacious. My only issue was that we found the water in the shower cold unless you turned the tap to “full blast”. This was our first hotel experience in the USA - there was no kettle or fridge in the room sadly but perhaps this is the norm? Other than that the room was great.  My only other concern was that Check In was self service but there were plenty of friendly staffers to help through the process (on visiting one of the other resorts we saw a really long cue at the Check In counter so maybe the self service wasn’t so bad in the end).    I would certainly recommend the Park as we found all staff friendly and ready to help.
20,I had been to this hotel 10+ years ago when it was the Monte Carlo. This is the same hotel just rebranded. Room was basic (not very clean) with old furniture and just repainted walls. Bed was very soft light & noise from Arena across the way could be heard until after mid-night 2 of the 3 nights we were there. We had zero interactions with staff as they have you check in and out on a computer touch screen. The whole building smells like smoke. For the prices there are better options.
40,Great location  modern room . Needs more storage for clothes. For two suitcases no place to keep that much clothes. 5 hangers and 2 small underwear drawers. I like my clothes put away on a stay. Had fun
10,Shows are a rip-off. I just came for an Aerosmith concert showing at this hotel. Paid airplane tickets concert tickets hotel meals just to find out 30 minutes before the show that Aerosmith was not having its presentation from the staff. They said there was nothing they could do and that ticket master would give me my money in 12 days. It was a wedding anniversary very upset and disappointed. Probably will never come back.
50,Great place to stay. All the staff are friendly and helpful. The Casino pool and Park MGM theatre were all great. Also close proximity to other sites. I would def stay at The Park MGM hotel in the future. Overall very good price for this hotel.
50,first time staying here and I will recommend this place to anyone great location and friendly staff. I went to a couple restaurants and their food was great. la la noodle have a really good lobster wontons....
40,This was a fantastic place to stay. Very close proximity to everything on the strip. There is a tram service to the Bellagio which we used often when attending other shows in that area and saved time on walking. Rooms were great for a couple with enough room to relax in. Nice and dark in the mornings as we had a couple of late nights and slept in.
50,Sure enjoyed staying at the Park MGM. The rooms were beautiful and staff was very friendly and helpful. Pool area was so nice especially the chairs in the pool. Enjoyed all the Italian shops to buy and eat at.
20,They don’t prorate your stay they were very unfriendly and although I made a reservation I had to wait 30-45 mins for a room. They were cold rushed and regimented... I expected much more for a first time stay at such a popular place.
30,The rooms were a bit small and the bathroom sink took a long time to drain aside from that everything was great. Eataly was amazing Nd the proximity to everything was great the park across the street was a nice addition to the area
20,The room and windows was dirty  the maid kept opening the door when I had a sign on the door. One time i was naked and she just bust in with people walking down the halls. Saying she didn't think I was there.
50,I loved the self check in and out super user friendly and quick! My friend and I stayed here for the I Heart Music Festival and had a wonderful stay. The room was clean spacious and quiet! The location was perfect! I found staff very friendly and the concierge was helpful and nice. The concierge helped my friend and I realize there is a free tram that goes from Park MGM to the Bellagio which was a great surprise! The casino was good not too crowded and didn’t smell of cigarette smoke like a lot of the resorts.    I spent time at the pool which is very clean and beautiful. I found there was plenty of chairs and places to lounge.    I would highly recommend this hotel! Very clean friendly staff and great location! 5 stars!
50,The room was very clean. The beds were super comfortable. The housekeeping staff did a great job. It’s awesome having everything you need in one building. Casino restaurants...all in all a great stay. Only complaint...no refrigerator in the room.
50,We loved this hotel and the wonderful people who helped us out right away!!!!! Very convenient location and great food!!!!! The room was very clean and the huge shower was a PLUS!!!! The beds were very comfortable and plenty of pillows!!!!
20,I would stay elsewhere. Since the remodel this hotel as gone down hill. A lot of the common things you find in a hotel are missing from here. From right when you enter there is no long a front desk with a employee there wanting to help you. There are maybe 15/16 self check in computers which forces you to check your self in. Put a bad taste in my mouth from the very first thing. Casino is much much smaller Drinks cost much more. comp drinks are only given for every 100 dollars of play.
50,I recently returned to my favorite Las Vegas resort which rivals with the best in our country.What a spectacular time we all had !The purpose of this vacation was to see my favorite band AEROSMITH for the 2nd time on this tour.When we arrived We were treated very special at the VIP desk and were allowed to check in immediately .Once arriving in the rooms they were very clean and fresh smelling. The beds as always were super comfortable.GREAT ROOMS FOR COMFORT. Once in the resort we always take advantage of pools restaurant's and casino.The pool area is so awesome with great waitress service and yummy food.We used the private pool everyday.We ate all of the restaurants on the property and each had its own charm and uniqueness .Reservations were easy to get even with the busy concert weekend in the area.The casino is very clean and doesn't have a smokey smell like most of the other casinos in Vegas.The Park Theatre is probably one of the best venues to hear musical far as seating and music quality. If you have never seen AEROSMITH before this would be the venue to see them for first-timers and long time fans such as myself .Overall this is a 5 star resort and great value for your $$$.Not to be passed up on.The staff in the resort is always smiling and eager to help with all your needs whatever they may be. A big shout out to my new great friends at the resort for MISS L and MIKE G who made our time super- memorable and can't wait to go back in the spring for the end of this tour.
30,The Park MGM was touted by my friends as being an up and coming Hotel/ Resort and that the changes that have been made are great. While my stay was not horrible there are several other properties that I would prefer to stay at next time. I did not experience the hype.
50,We took our teenagers out for the iHeart Radio Music Festival so we wanted to stay close to the T Mobile arena. The hotel’s location was perfect. We stayed in a Nightingale Suite which was a great room for four. Plenty of room and they did a great job on remodel! Restaurants were great. Eataly is a must do. Pool area is beautiful and the staff was very friendly and helpful. We look forward to our next trip to the Park MGM.
10,Check in is horrible. We had to wait 90 minutes to check in. Rude staff.Paper thin walls. You can hear everything in the next room. They charge $45 a day for resort fee but only provide a single bar of soap (no soap in the shower).
50,At the park mgm ordered pizza and a peroni . Identical to what we had in Tuscany same identical pizza spot on . Very tasty with a side of arancini balls. The menu was very authentic Italian and was so close to what we had in Italy . We are coming back for the pasta and appetizers.
10,"TERRIBLE from beginning to end. From the loud music blasting away in the lobby to being dismissed to the computers to check ourselves in to the rooms that look like something out of a cheap motel to the walls so thin I could hear our ""neighbor's"" conversation. Unbelievably bad.  This establishment charges too much money to be so poorly run."
50,I really like this hotel and my suite was very comfortable.    One of my pet peeves in Vegas is that I am always waiting on lines to check in. This was the first time that I used the self check-in kiosks and it could not have been easier or more convenient.    Great view from the room as well.
50,We have just come back from our 20th trip to Vegas and this was the best by far. Our Casino host Catherine could not have been more attentive and our request for a high room close to the lift also could not have been better. We had a Nighthawk suit which was perfect for fantastic views of Rio Aria Cosmopolitan and part of the strip. We found the staff both friendly and accommodating and loved every minute of our trip. The modifications that have been made are great and we spent sometime of every evening having a coffee and sweet in Eatily
50,We have stayed in Las Vegas a number of times but this was our first stay at the Park MGM. Having read recent reviews we were a bit concerned about storage as we were staying for two weeks but we managed ok. Our stay was made better by VIP desk manager Toni O'Neill who was extremely helpful and very professional. Any other staff we dealt with were also happy to help. Our room was a Queen strip view and was bright and newly decorated (it was one of the red rooms). The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was clean and bright with a large walk in shower.    The location was good with easy access to the Bellagio/Aria and Vdara by a free tram. We would be happy to stay here again.
30,No small refrigerator or drawers.. no fans in bathroom although the staff wasn’t that bad I’d have to say the best part was the pool being free. Kinda a pain having to pull your card out for the security guard every time you wanna go to the elevators aswell.
10,When I booked this hotel I wasn't told that you have to pay a 500.00 deposit. Then when I asked for a manager the staff were very rude and said that the manager wasn't in. This hotel is definitely not worth the money.
10,Checkin failed for reasons they never figured out. My room was on the 15th floor and I could hear the club over 10 stories below clear as day all night... on a Wednesday.    The casino floor needs better filtration as it always smells like smoke unlike other casinos.    I hear the NoMad part isn’t as bad but overall the worst casino I’ve stayed at on the strip. The only redeeming quality was Eatly.
50,The MGM Park was wonderful! The entire staff was so friendlier and helpful. Check-in was easy (thank you Elizabeth). Our room was clean and comfortable. There are a lot of fun slot machines in the casino. Thank you MGM for a great stay!
20,We arrived in our room to find the one queen bed had stained bedding. We asked multiple times for someone to have housekeeping change the bedding. We arrived on an early Friday afternoon and we finally by late Sunday had bedding changed.
40,Very nice clean and a friendly atmosphere. The location is quite convenient also. Lots to see and do in the area. I would definitely recommend this property to friends. The staff was helpful too. Plenty of tables and a nice variety of slots to choose from..
20,Staff was rude and not helpful. I was not happy with my stay so I left and stayed at another hotel. I will not be going back and staying there the next time I go to Las Vegas I had a problem with my check in and room and nothing was done I was told that is the way it is soorry
50,We absolutely enjoyed our visit to Park MGM. A refreshing casino experience. The energy was electric. The staff was ultra friendly. Good dining experience. My wife and I enjoyed it and will be back agin soon.
50,We stayed at Park MGM the new version of the old Monte Carlo Resort. The room upgrades are modern and comfortable. The resort also had many new restaurants and bars. We tried and enjoyed a couple of them namely Primrose for breakfast and Manzo for a late dinner. The addition of Eataly was also a pleasant surprise. A Charcuterie board for a snack was amazing followed up with Italian coffee and dessert to top it off.I would go back in a heartbeat !
50,Easy access to major hotels with the tram access. Great atmosphere inside and out. Very relaxing walking at the park located just outside the hotel. I wouldn’t mind staying here again with my wife. She loves it.
40,We had a great time over the weekend very friendly staff and nice room. Water pressure in shower is awesome. Convenience store was a little pricy but good options. Wish we would of had time to enjoy the pools but we were too busy
20,As I expressed on my review the room was not clean up to par and one day after room service was performed no towels were left. I approached a room service employee to get towels and was promised towels and that never happened. I had to purchase my own towels.
40,Great location and the best part of the Hotel for sure. Check-in and Check-out was easy and digital with a self check-in/out kiosk. Not the biggest property but had everything you need and with a ton of restaurants walking distance. Best location for T-Mobile arena.
50,The Park is an excellent place to stay on the strip. It’s located in the middle of everything. Tons of different restaurants to choose from on property if you don’t want to walk/travel anywhere. Eataly was FANTASTIC! There is no other property with this eatery/shops. The room was spacious for just one bed. The strip view was perfect and it wasn’t noisy. The Aerosmith concert was also great considering it was just downstairs from our room. I highly recommended this resort/casino!
10,Horrible customer service. They really don't care what room they stick you in. My tv did not work. When I notified the front desk they smiled and said engineering would be right up. Never happened. Oh if you want soaps good luck. When I complained I was told I was the 5th guest to bring up this issue. I ended up going to CVS to buy my own.
30,Clean hotel and friendly staff. There was no coffee pot in the room. And coffee was not readily available in the lobby either. Room size was good. There were options for eating in the hotel or nearby. Great location if you are there for a show at the Park MGM or across the street at the T-Mobile center.
30,However AC worked poorly conSidering you are in the dessert. Never cooled to the temp set and kept turning on and off. No extras in the room like air dryer or Ironing board so be prepared to ask. The elevators were fast.
30,Middle of the road property on the strip . Nice workout facility and a fairly decent staff . The rooms were average size the bed was not that comfortable very basic furnishings . Plenty of restaurant options of course but a little pricey . If you like to play slot machines the selection is not that good in the machines a lot of times are old and not even working well . This property has a very basic sports book this property has a very basic sports book . With the moderate prices they don’t attract the best of crowds . But I guess you get what you pay for . They have a nice theater although the show we attended the sound was below average in quality ... for a residency we did not think this should’ve been a problem a little bit disappointed . Not really sure this has enough to offer for me to want to come back.... there are simply so many options in Vegas you really have to be on your game to beat out the competition .
50,Wonderful place centrally located. Good service and great atmosphere. Had a good stay. Checkout was easy. Staff was friendly. Maintenance was quick to serve. Rooms are clean and comfortable. Thank you
20,Bad experience with room service never got a resolution. Little to no security for the paying customers had random person running down hall trying to open doors. Someone came into our room unannounced told front desk and never got back to us.
10,I was a victim of someone trying to enter my room and placing a mirror under my door in the adjoining room. I did not feel safe at all during my visit there were no other rooms they can move me too I am very dissatisfied with my experience I was terrified the entire night wondering if someone was going to come in my room. They deactivated the keys to the next room but didn’t resolve my discomfort
50,I must admit we were a bit hesitant about staying here after reading some of the reviews. We couldn't have been more pleased with our stay. The check in process was a breeze. There were plenty of attendants to help with the process. Elizabeth was very friendly and helpful in getting us checked in. We arrived on a Sunday 9:30am and our room was ready for us an hour later. We stayed in a corner Nightingale suite on the 6th floor. The room was very spacious and well appointed. It was a 2 queen unit with a leather couch 2 chairs/table and a long window bench seat. There was also a nice wet bar. I know many people complained of not having a dresser this unit did have a large one. The room was very clean and the beds comfortable. Housekeeping did an outstanding job cleaning the room in a timely fashion and leaving us extra towels and toiletries. While the room did not have much of a view as it faced the convention center it was quiet and close to the elevators. The location of the hotel is good and having the free tram to the Bellagio was a nice perk. The hotel casino is a bit small and quiet in comparison to other casinos but that was a nice respite. The restaurants on site are nice but pricey. Breakfast at the Primrose was $50 for 2 entrees and 2 coffees. There are 3 pools which were clean and a nice pool bar. The customer service was outstanding. The entire staff was helpful and friendly. Our only complaint was that the resort fee really includes nothing. It would have been nice to have been given a couple of bottles of water and have easy access to complimentary coffee. Sadly this is how Vegas operates now. There is CVS next door to purchase water beer/wine and anything else you might need at a third of the price of the hotel store. If you're looking for a reasonable breakfast directly across the street is a Denny's. All in all we had an enjoyable stay and wouldn't hesitate to stay at the Park MGM again.
20,MGM Park is clearly not the MGM quality and standard... the rooms and hotel are very dated and are consistent with a Holiday Inn versus an MGM experience- rooms are super cheap (no desk) size is very small and walls are so paper thin i got tired of hearing everyone around me (including bathroom)
40,We stayed for 6 nights to celebrate our 30th wedding Anniversary.    Used the VIP checking on arrival and was upgraded to a strip view however on getting to the room it was obvious someone had been laid on the bed prior to us getting in there so they swapped our room which was much better. We were on 26th floor room spacious and clean but some of the furniture dated and no fridge which is disappointing.    The bathroom was spotless but the shower screen did not do its job so floor always ended up wet. USB charging points next to bed so handy for your phones.    No issues with lifts they all appeared to work and never had to wait too long for one.    Pool area is nice and only really gets the sun after midday. Pool bar expensive I thought so didn’t buy many drinks easy enough to go across road to ABC store and buy alcohol to drink by pool 😎. Pool was cold but not too cold once you were in.    Casino stinks of cigarettes but to be fair all the casinos did so decided not to spend any time in there at all.    Hotel is in a great location on the strip with easy access to other hotels monorails and buses. Taxi are also available when needed. All staff were helpful and friendly. We had a good stay overall but the smoking bedroom issue initially wet floor in bathroom and expensive drinks make it a 4 not a 5.
50,Just returned from a 13 night stay at the Park MGM Hotel and can't fault anything about our stay. We checked in after 15 hours travelling we used the VIP desk where Toni O'Neill the reception manager booked us in she was great very patient and couldn't have been more helpful nothing was too much trouble. Our rooms were a decent size beds comfortable shower great and everything cleaned daily to a high standard. Our room overlooked the T Mobile Arena and Park it was very quiet and we enjoyed the view. We used the hotel casino regularly and can't speak highly enough about Lilly a cocktail waitress who was so friendly efficient and always wished us good luck she was a lovely person. The Park MGM is in a perfect location with tables and chairs outside to sit and chill. Loved the hotel and would go back in a minute.
30,Didn't deliver the Las Vegas experience people expect sums up my vacation this year. Dirty rooms resort fees are ridiculous. No refrigerator microwave in room extra charge. I'll will stay staff tried to help where possible. Discounting room and comp my birthday on room charges. But this falls short of what someone coming to Las Vegas. I been coming since the late 1980's. I m seriously considering other venues as Vegas is loosing favor in my eyes.
20,This hotel offer poor service arrived a day later because Airline took off earlier before schedule departure. Arrived in Las Vegas on the morning September 122019 o2oo hrs when arrived at MGM was told that rooms was not ready for another hour.when rooms was suppose to be ready on the 11 of September at 1500 hrs. When given keys to room at this time it was o315 hrs in the morning of the 12th. Once I received keys to room keys didn't work . Had to make three trip to front desk coming from 22 floor to get the right keys for my room. After checking into room and being there for 2days sleeping and eating in room .house keeping did not clean room until morning of Check out. Moreover had to walk quiet a distance from MGM to MGM signature. Poor services.
20,"My husband and I stayed the week for our anniversary and were very disappointed with the hotel. The room was very plain with very little in it. No dresser no refrigerator little space around the bathroom sink for things and with no shelf or towel bar. Beware of the water pressure in the shower...it hurt! Way too powerful and you couldn't adjust it. I dreaded taking showers. The air conditioning didn't work too well even at its lowest setting of 62. Sucks having to PAY to use a room safe in Vegas. The bathroom door was a sliding door that ran from the bathroom across the very tiny closet area so if you opened the bathroom door while someone was getting clothes you hit them with the door. Very awkward set up. Eataly was nice though fancy and expensive. Other than a small handful of nicer restaurants there wasn't anywhere to eat ""regular"" food like grab a quick sandwich pizza or some sort of food court. Other than a couple high end shops there was no shopping center. We notified someone of all of the fruit flies swarming the vending machine room but it fell on deaf ears. That was disgusting. The good thing was the pool was close to the elevators so you weren't walking halfway through the casino to get to the pool. Won't stay again."
50,I had an amazing time at Park MGM. The staff was great and the accommodations were spectacular. Several team members left an impression  Den - Security 9/13 11am  Jeff B - Primrose 9/13 9:30am  Patricia - Concierge 3:20pm  Sylvia - Side Betty Grill  Samait - Buffet MGM Grand  DonNiko - Sports Grill  Warren - Bell Desk  Pino - Transportation
10,I pre-checked in using the web and was assured I would receive a QR code to make check-in a breeze. Systems did not work empty concierge bell and guest service stations. Staff was downright rude and would not even make eye contact. If you don't mind being treated like a piece of gum on the bottom of someone's shoe go ahead and give it a try. Otherwise avoid this hotel until they rethink and revamp the whole check-in process!
50,Business Stay at Park MGM Las Vegas was awesome loved the staff and the restaurants. The location is also ideal. There is a tram in the back of the hotel that takes you to the mall and other great locations. This was an awesome say. Just across the street from the MGM Grand also. I would recommend this hotel if you are staying in Vegas.
50,We enjoyed our stay at Park MGM very much. This was our daughters’ first time in LV as adults. They felt very comfortable in the hotel and casino even when venturing out by themselves. We appreciated the atmosphere and friendly service. We will definitely stay at Park MGM again.
30,Nice lobby but the guest floors are remodeled but dated. Low ceiling and dark hallways. No fridge in room and room service is served in takeout boxes. A Pepsi hotel and Coke is hard to find and you can’t keep it cold. Water pressure was awesome but no refills on body wash.
10,No one knew basic info. From check in to redeeming the offerings in room packages and even the concierge didn’t know and didn’t offer or try to help or find out... very time consuming and frustrating.
40,We have stayed previously at at the Signature MGM Suites but this time wanted somewhere closer to the strip.    The Park MGM is really well located between New York New York and Aria and Waldorf Astoria. The casino is one of the smaller hotel casinos so getting to the strip takes only 5 mins once down the elevators from your room.    The offering of places to eat and drink are great from the deli style Eataly with small wine bars and great offerings of freshly prepared pizza sandwiches pasta fish and tapas. For restaurants there is a great Noodle bar.    The rooms are well equipped but you don’t have anything to make hot drinks with or a fridge but there are ice stations and vending machines on each floor.    The offering of a gym which is adequate to get a decent workout with weights or the treadmill. There are also three outdoor swimming pools providing towels and sun lounger bar service.    We had a great stay here and would definitely stay again and recommend to other travellers.
40,Hotel was great. Good gambling great location. Not too busy for a weekend. Food sucks. You are better off leaving the hotel to eat. The eatealy sucks and I would not waste your money eating there . Food is not tasty it’s over priced  menus in Italian not English staff tries to speak in Italian and it’s frustrating; explain the dish in English! I speak English!!
10,For over $300 night I got a spacious yet empty motel room at a hotel price. The walls were so thin I could hear casual conversations next door and even the sound of the curtain chain drawing.    Despite the price there was no in-room amenities like coffee maker or even a dresser to put our clothes. Just single shelf in the closet to be shared between to people.  Despite downloading the MGM app to my phone in order to (as advertised) skip the check in line the app failed to deliver and I had to wait in a long line to get checked in and another line to get the room I reserved (which I never actually got).  When you book expect to pay a deposit of 1/3 your total stay price upon check in expect to then pay the full amount of the stay plus another $200 deposit for incidentals.    I have stayed several places in Las Vegas and Park MGM has so far been the costliest disappointment.
50,Thank you for your kindness helpfulness and overall demeanor. The hotel is amazing affordable and very boutique feel even though it is massive. Overall great experience - And not to mention it is very affordable.
10,Checkin is self-serve and exposes other customer data. Plus you get to wait 25 minutes for a bar code to arrive on your phone then wait in line again then use non-intuitive kiosk again. After a flight this is the last thing you want to be doing.
30,It was small and dark. I was in the King Deluxe. It wasn't big enough for 2 people. The hall to the room was dark and didn't feel secure. If the purpose of the decor of the room was to keep you out of the room and in the casino - it works. The bed also was quite low. Good point to room was because it was small the bathroom was convient.
20,The staff was great the facility and amenities are lacking. I've stayed in much nicer hotels for much less. Spartan rooms and kind of college dormish in feel. Cheap decor and did not live up to expectations.
10,Just spent three days here - walls were so thin I thought someone was in my room when I heard the next door room talking on the phone at 5am. Also heard the curtains going up and down.    Trash bin full in room when I got there - empty coffee cups.
40,This is the little brother to the Grand - no coffee in room no desk small bathroom. Great bed and good service just not as big. Really like the MGM Grand but this one is not as nice. And everything was a long walk to get to.
20,The pool water was too cold to even enjoy and nothing for the kids to do not enough storage for clothing in the room and there is NO POKER ROOM!!! Will not be returning to this hotel poker room is very important for my husband in Vegas. Decided to give the hotel a try since our nights were free but not anymore.
30,1st time at PARK MGM did not care for the 1st impression of the associate at the check in kiosk.  Did not care for the sliding door shared between the closet and the bathroom very dangerous if someone is standing a the closet and someone else is exiting the bathroom.
40,I would like to cancel one of the days. I was unable to because It was not in time. I called 1 hr and 50 minutes too late. I was confused and did not read this. I had an important matter to take care of so I missed Thursday night
40,Rooms are very clean beds are very comfortable I was a little thrown off that we didn't have a fridge in our room. Staff was very friendly. There wasn't much to do or places to eat in the hotel. Overall a good stay.
50,I went on a solo trip to Las Vegas to see Bruno Mars who was performing at MGM Park Theater. Everything was very convenient for me. The room was nice the view was awesome and the hot tub and pools were quite relaxing.
30,Don’t get me wrong there is nothing wrong with this hotel it just didn’t bring any qualities which drew us back to this hotel. It is fresh and new the casino is average and it is frustrating walking through the ‘Eataly’ section to get inside. The best thing about this hotel is the location but there are many other hotels in this area to choose from
50,It's super clean very friendly starbucks right at the base of the elevators to get to your room..... But it's a bit too expensive (atm) for what you get. (psa: no drawers in the room for your cloths!)
20,"We upgraded to a slightly better room so with $37 day resort fee you're looking at $200 per day. We had a 4th floor room and long hallway was dark as if night time in middle of the day. Room was a bit stark with views of the roof and pipes mostly. No robo-bar or mini-fridge or in room coffee maker. Now here's a first - no dresser drawers or anything to put your cloths other than small closet with some hangers - so plan on leaving everything in your suitcase during your stay. A couple bottles of non-refrigerated water and a couple pricey snacks in room at prices few would want to pay. We were there for Bruno Mars show and planned on hanging out at pool and relaxing the rest of the time. The pool area is among the worst I've encountered and again this is what you get with a less expensive ""entry-level"" hotel. There are 3 small pools: one is 3'6"" deep small & was packed with kids and adults/parents. 2nd off to side was about same and 3rd was a long canal type pool that was 4' deep. These pools are really for sitting on the edge or standing in and forget about swimming due to how shallow and number of people. Now for the worst part that ruins any thought of relaxing - the MUSIC! There are speakers at all 3 pools with loud rock music with a heavy bass beat in the background [THUMP THUMP THUMP!]. This is non-stop all day long. We rented a cabana day bed the 2nd day and when we finally fell asleep we were both jolted awake as the music volume was somehow turned up - HUh? What?? Are you kidding me?? This was about the least relaxing atmosphere you could imagine. As to the ""entry-level"" remark it also showed in the pool area: plastic food trays left poolside at edge of pool by people beer cans and plastic drink cups lying on the ground and in general some really messy and inconsiderate guests were staying here [I felt bad for the server girls who were hustling and picking up people's trash but due to large number of people the few servers were fighting a losing battle. Also they have a security check-point at pool area to check purses & other & no alcohol can be brought in [yes they even check water bottles for content by shaking them].That way you can pay the premium prices for the hotel drinks at the 2 poolside bars. As for the poolside bars they have bench cushions to sit that have stains all over them and many of the lounge chairs were the same so not sure if they ever clean them - you'll def want to lay on your towels. Also keep all your receipts from the poolside bars as there were some discrepancies on our room charges. We had a couple drinks the 2 days at pool and burgers/sandwiches each day and somehow had over $300 in charges [and I charged one of the lunches on my credit card?].We saw the charges when completing the automated check-out in lobby the next morning & just did not want to deal with the issue as leaving for airport & we were done for good with the MGM Park. I would not return to this hotel regardless of the price and next time will stay at the Bellagio or other higher end hotels - Yes they are more expensive but you certainly get what you pay for."
40,Great hotel! Conveniently located affordable. The eating experience is amazing since they have Eataly on their casino floor! Our overall experience was very good and we definitely will stay there again!
50,Self Check in was very easy and quick. Room was comfortable and clean.  Pool area was great! Staff friendly and helpful. Perfectly located to the Strip with easy access. Will definitely stay here again next visit!
30,People this is Vegas - choose another hotel!    First Time at PARK MGM LAS VEGAS. Bottom line - disappointing. Maybe this is all deliberate so no one stays in the room & gambles downstairs instead    THE POSITIVE  Sure - let's Start with Two Positives    1 - Staff: Friendly & helpful.  2 - Restaurants Onsite: Starbucks but the winner here is Eataly - Awesome!!    THE NEGATIVE: DISAPPOINTING GUEST ROOM  Guest Room: Mediocre to Lousy.  Bed is comfortable but the bedding feels cheap & scratchy  Bathroom really small this is more like NYC then Vegas; cheap sink fixtures  A/C not powerful enough. I have this room pushed down to 60 and it's still hot - calibration is way way off  Lighting is poor & insufficient  Furniture is ugly & oversized for room - making it feel cramped.  Awkward to get past a huge red couch to close window shades Can't get past an oversized table to get to a trash can  No coffee maker in room  Room is dark & depressing.
20,Comedy of errors. Upon arriving i requested a refrigerator for my medication and an additional luggage rack. I received the fridge 6 hours later the luggage rack the next day. Room service was delivered in a paper shopping bag.  The water was off for several hours beginning at 11p.m. I spent the night with friend. While I was provided with adjustments This trip was stressful as opposed to the retirement celebration I was anticipating. Very disappointed!
50,A great place to stay. Very clean environment and the staff where all so pleasant. I love the space in the rooms and love the shower which was very spacious. Easy access to everything. I would recommend this place to everyone if they wish to have a comfortable stay at a great hotel.
30,Park MGM is just an average place charging high prices because they are close to T/Mobile and Park Theater. Save the money stay elsewhere and Uber to events there. The breakfast options are limited to one place and Starbucks which is always crazy busy. Bavett’s is awesome as us Eataly and there is no buffet
50,Loved staying at the MGM park the hotel rooms was very nice the bed was a little hard but rooms very clean ate at Lala noodles and that pace was so good and all the workers went out of there way to help in any way would eat there again and I am telling friends about that place
40,The Park MGM formally the Monte Carlo is one of our go to hotels in Vegas. The price is right and newly remodeled. Staff has always been very friendly and helpful. Very affordable stay on the strip close to M&M world and the Hershey Store along with other souvenir shops.
50,Our Stay was Wonderful! Check in was effortless threw the Kiosk section. Our room was clean and had a nice view of the pools. Eatly was amazing the food was fresh and tasty. Will defiantly visit the resort again!
20,Many better hotels on the strip to choose from. This is a new and clean hotel however with no coffee maker in the room it is not as well appointed as a Holiday Inn Express. Underwhelming experience.
50,I’m writing this review a year after I originally stayed here. The hotel was undergoing some renovations and was already looking pretty good at the time. Fast forward a year later and they have done an outstanding job to the property. I can see myself staying here again in the future.
40,Very convenient and nice upgrades from Monte Carlo. Impressive theater nice rooms and the staff was helpful. Great location with access to our favorite hotels and casinos. Definitely enjoyed the Bruno Mars concert.
50,Mobile app made checking in and out easy. Friendly service with everyone we interacted with. Paid a little extra to try the Wellness room. For my family it was worth it. Room seemed cleaner with the air purifier and hypoallergenic sheets.
30,The room was very basic and very small. I could hear the music and conversations from the rooms on each side of me and loud music from the strip. The steakhouse was absolutely one of the best I've been to though and I would definitely make a return visit there.
50,We have stayed at several hotels over the years and was very pleased with Park MGM. Location loved the room! The room was efficient eye pleasing quiet the bed was comfortable. The staff was great and friendly. And we never had to wait for the elevator ever no matter what time of day. We enjoyed the convenience of going to shows at both the Park MGM theater and the T Mobile Arena.
50,Ive been to Vegas about 6 times in the past 4 yrs and this by far has been my most enjoyable stay. I loved the vibe of this hotel. The Staff were friendly and i liked the check in/check out experience MGM offers through mobile. It worked very well. I will recommend this hotel to family and friends
10,I booked a Bruno Mars concert rooms at Park MGM and dinner at Bavette's to celebrate my wife's birthday. When we arrived the Bell desk receptionist was not very receptive to our questions as to where the guest elevators were which was a start to bad weekend. Our room A/C was not running properly and there were no shampoo/body wash/lotion in the bathroom. The call to the front desk took over 10 minutes to reach an operator. But the worst offender was Bavette's. We had 7:45pm rsvp and when checked in they told us they were running a little behind. We checked back at 8:15 and was told another 30 minutes while holding concert tickets for 9:00pm show. Ended up having to celebrate my wife's birthday dinner with fast food. Only one who didn't disappoint was Bruno Mars!! Go see Bruno Mars but think twice about Park MGM and avoid Bavettes like the plague.
20,The MGM Park is really the old Monte Carlo hotel. Not much was upgraded or improved the rooms are still tired musty and the beds definitely are old.  And who stays in hotels where all the restaurants close at 11pm?
30,We were at the Park MGM to see Bruno Mars. After the concert we were hungry. EVERYTHING was either closing or already closed. Well except for LaLa Noodle but please! VERY disappointing. We had our taste buds set on EATALY but nope. We tried all the other places nope everything was closed. It's VEGAS on a Saturday night!
50,Without exception the staff is first rate they are helpful knowledgeable and courteous. The hotel/casino is centrally located with easy access to other casinos either by walking to those in the immediate vicinity (MGM Grand & New York New York) or by the tramway shuttle to the Bellagio and casinos further north.
20,Hotel rooms are not well kept. Spotty sheets and towels and I didn't feel that the room had been thoroughly cleaned. The hallways are very dark and I didn't feel safe walking to my room by myself at night.
10,The room was very old and dated. There were electrical wires on the wall. The bed was was very near to the floor and the mattress was very uncomoftable. The lighting in the room was not appealing to the eye. The hallways were very dark and dimly lit.
50,Wonderful place to stay. Great Italian eateries. The slots where lose and craps was fun. Rooms are very comfortable and spacious. Customer service was very accommodating. Only issue was the water being turned off while I was there during the night for one night.
40,Loved location. Hotel was nice. Liked room decor which was different. Staff all very nice. Didn’t use any amenities. Originally thought was part of MGM grand but us separate hotel across the street. Casino is small but nice. Won couple hundred on slots.
40,From the moment you enter the resort you get the feeling of safety and comfort. Every member of staff was welcoming and helpful. The room was clean and very comfortable. I'll be returning in the very near future.
50,This was my first time in Las Vegas and I enjoyed it a lot. The Park MGM’s location is key since everything is extremely close. Eataly was amazing and had great restaurants. I would definitely go back to this hotel.
30,Poor value for the price of the room good location on the strip with easy access lots of parking room but expensive room quality was terrible with stained carpets dirty mirrors and fixtures. Check in process was easy and quick
10,Upon check in to the Park MGM the check was extremely confusing with no assistance. Once arriving to our room we noticed trash was not emptied dirty linen was left on the chair hand prints all over the windows
50,My stay at Park MGM was wonderful. I would recommend this hotel to other family and friends. Rooms were clean staff was helpful had a great pool area and the casino was great. It is also close to other attractions.
20,Park MGM start using Self Check-in system which looks new and cool. However the screen of the self check-in is so big and it will show my personal information on the screen such as my full name phone number personal address etc. That means whoever line up at my back or any customer(s) pass by can easily get my personal information (using cellphone to take picture). This is against PIPEDA.
50,I got 7 of my close friends to come to the Park MGM for a 3 night stay it was 3 couples and 1 person to celebrate the end of summer. So we needed 4 rooms and I knew this place would not disappoint since I have stayed her before while it was under construction. They loved this place as much as I do the food options are amazing and reasonably priced compared to most others on the strip. The rooms were clean modern and tastefully done. The decor is simply amazing and we loved the casino floor to do some gambling between shows and cabana in the 3 nights we stayed! The staff was a huge part in this success from the bell hops to the housekeeping and even a painter was so nice and made us feel vip status. Thank you Park Mgm we will be back shortly!! This place does not disappoint in any area of the resort! Keep it up you guys have truly scored a goal/touchdown with this property!!
20,If you’re staying at PARK MGM in Las Vegas don’t expect good service. We are members of Mlife and the treatment was not good two nights we did not have a land line we decided to stay another night and we had no Housekeeping. It’s very sad because we’re platinum members. Room service doesn’t have much options. Food from Lala noodles is that good
50,Our stay at Park MGM was a stand-out experience! Very professional and responsive staff centrally located on the strip across the street from T-Mobile (we chose this hotel since we came in for a concert) and tram to Bellagio/Caesars/Aria walking distance to Planet Hollywood etc..) great contemporary atmosphere excellent dining options (we chose La La Noodles for a bite prior to the concert and their pad thai was a revelation - just be sure to make a reservation) well-appointed room (only criticism is there wasn't a coffee maker but room spacious quiet and beds super-comfortable) and the hotel is pet-friendly. Our old pup (15 years old) traveled with us and collapsed in the late afternoon heat when we arrived - scary! The bell staff and security staff was right on it with cool water shade and a ride on the bell cart up to our room. Within minutes we received a call to check to see how she was doing and the staff was helpful and solicitous with her and us for the rest of our stay.
50,Park MGM is located mid strip and is close to T-Mobile. The new etaly restaurant area is great. Plenty of food shops across the street restaurant s too. Coming soon Target. Casino is midsize but has all you need
20,Not overly impressed. The rooms were recently renovated however still not up to par with the other resorts on the strip. They basically painted the old Monte Carlo and redid the bathrooms which were decent.
50,Stayed at Park MGM for a business conference. As an event professional I literally live in hotels. Park MGM was easy to check in to appropriately priced demonstrated exceptional service and had wonderful meeting space that I'm now considering bringing a group back to and I usually try to avoid Vegas as a destination unless I have too. Well done!
50,Love the Park MGM  Great Location  Nice Remodel Job  Well Trained Staff  Park Theatre is A Great. Venue  The Rooms need to be Sound Proof  Steak House was Wonderful  Early is now Open Great Places to Select Wine & Excellent Food
30,First the good. The bed was one of the most comfortable I’ve ever slept on. The room was clean and good sized. This was a MyVegas comp so I wasn’t surprised to have a view of rooftop vents.  I was initially charged the full amount of the room plus the incidental hold. It took about a dozen phone calls to guest services and transfers to the “cashier” to get things fixed. I never got to speak to a person face to face.  Each day they tried to charge me for valet parking too. It was just my husband and me and we didn’t have a car. We flew in from Wisconsin took a cab to the resort and got a bus pass. When I called about it the guy actually said “Well maybe you have a friend who has a car because I have the valet ticket.” Somehow after speaking with him for several minutes he finally believed me and removed the charge. But when I went to check out the next day there was another charge for valet parking. I called guest services again and the woman fixed things right away this time. How do they let anyone charge valet to rooms that aren’t theirs??  Our second two nights my husband’s MyVegas comp were even better. Our room wasn’t ready when we checked in at 7:30 pm so we were sent to the VIP desk where a nice lady named Alexus switched us from a king room to one with two queen beds. It was on a higher floor with a view of the pool area and a walk in shower. Because our room wasn’t ready she comped us $100 for food. She explained that we just needed to charge it to our room. When we checked out the comp wasn’t there. So we went back to the VIP desk and explained. The lady fixed it right away.  So the bad is keep an eye on your room charges because of you don’t pay attention you’re likely to pay for anything.
10,One of the worst hotels to stay in on the strip. Came for the Bruno Mars concert and chose this hotel because the concert is at the same location. Self check in kiosks do not work. Maybe half of the kiosks were online? Tried two different ones. You need to scan your ID  enter your own credit card information and you’re supposed to get the keys. The scanner did not work in the first kiosk. In the second one we got credit card approval and the system kicked us out —twice. You can call for help but with everyone needing help it takes a while. Finally the person helping us said it happens because connection gets lost. He had to check us in manually. Then we get a room facing a cement wall. You’d expect something better with a hotel and the name MGM attached. I would recommend improving the number of working kiosks and get more help or give jobs back to people so the check in process and your first impression of your hotel is a good one.
40,Did a quick two night stay because I had the rooms comped. I loved the ease of checkin with the mLife app. Not much drawer space I’d you are going to be there for a bit or with two people. Took advantage of the late checkout option which I highly recommend if you aren’t flying out until later in the day.
20,We were checked into a dirty room from hand prints on the windows to linen on the chair trash in the bins dirty-stained sheets an inch of dust surrounding the bed and food particles on the floor. Moving rooms was an inconvenience no one followed up after to see if our second room was to our satisfaction or apologize for the dirty room. On the positive side the bell staff were phenomenal exceptionally welcoming courteous and helpful.
40,The park has lots of options dining and entertainment either in the hotel or steps away! Recommend this MGM property for Access to the arena.... easy in and our ride sharing and great for walking to other venues!
50,Great place to stay for Business and Pleasure. The Automated check in counter makes it very convenient and fast. The Staff of the Hotel and M life were very supportive and corteous. The EATALY was the one I really like Best having to experience great authentic and variety of Italian food.
10,Definitely upgraded from the old Monte Carlo and good location...but the fees have gotten out of hand in Las Vegas and the Park MGM is leading the charge with drink fees on top of resort fees parking fees etc.
50,Best on the strip the dedicated staff was very nice and helpful I will be back for an upgraded room if possible. I would love to experience what else park MGM has to graciously offer I barely could stay for 10hr checked in at 5 pm and my direct flight left at 4 am precisely so we typically left at 3 am so couldn't enjoy our room sad face.
50,I enjoy my stay on with u guys. The gaming just happy. I was able too come out to Las Vegas. I been over the road for three month's. So with ability to come off the road to the park MGM was great so thank u guys for the experience
40,Although we got a good price online I wasn’t prepared for the extra $54 a night for spa/resort fees and taxes that was due when I checked in. Next time I will stay at a regular hotel for the price we paid in fees and taxes.
50,The park MGM was very friendly and clean. The staff were great. The location was one of the best on the strip. They had a great selection of slot machines. Looking forward to staying there again. Great job.
50,We had some reservations about staying here after reading some of the reviews about the property. I made the reservation thru the My Las Vegas game as this was the only MGM property with rooms available. Since we were only paying resort fees and taxes/fees we weren't expecting much and were just hoping that the room would be clean. What a pleasant surprise the room was immaculate and well equipped/supplied! Although we did have a problem of lack of running water for a few hours we still have a lovely stay. I spoke with the front desk staff a couple of times and had contact with numerous housekeeping staff in the hallways. Everyone was incredibly friendly helpful always smiling. The bed reminded me of the Westin's Heavenly Bed it was so comfortable. We would not hesitate staying there again and I hope others will have the same experience!
40,"Very nice venue for Cher concert!  Did not stay in this hotel but enjoyed ""visiting"" with a walk through going to the Cher concert.  Nice looking restaurants but too expensive for me. I would attend another show here for sure!"
30,"Room was not cleaned for a whole day. Front desk told me that Housekeeping ""cleans all day"" after I asked her why my room wasn't cleaned by 4:30pm when we left at 10am. Left again to attend a Bruno Mars show around 7pm got back at 2am to the same dirty room. No accomodations were made so I guess this is how they typically treat guests. Unacceptable"
20,Got into the hotel from about 10am  ok system was down  we was ask to come back in one hour  did that oh its still down we can check you in aftee 1pm for sure ! Now its after 2pm we have to met a wedding party at 3pm was traveling from 4 : 30am Atlanta time  went back to tey check in now its a line wraped near the casino area and We have to get ready to head out ! Didn't get into my room until after 7pm.
50,Park MGM has become my favourite resort on the strip. I used to like the Cosmo due to its views of the fountains but I much much prefer the vibe and style at Park MGM. It is great to see the resort finally hitting completion and the new bars and restaurants including Eataly are great.    The location is great. It's next to NYNY the T-Mobile area connected to the aria by walkway and to Bellagio and Crystals by Tram. There's a CVS next door on the strip for any essentials and once the new footbridge opens (it looked almost complete) there is a Walgreens right across the street tii.    We stayed in a queen and found it to be a good size with very comfortable beds. Bathrooms are spacious modern and clean too.    The only thing I'd like is a fridge as standard and more hanging space but these things didn't bother me too much.    The pool complex is large with 3 pools to choose from and we found it laid back which is exactly what we wanted.    We ate in La La Noodle Mama Rabbit Primrose (3 times) The NoMad restaurant and Eataly many times and we enjoyed every meal I think La La Noodle was my favourite though it's chilled and pretty reasonably priced too.    Can't wait for the next visit already.
50,Great updates to the former Monte Carlo Hotel. Love the new pub and the multiple restaurants in the front.    Parking was easy to get into and leave. The Park Theater is a great venue. The Bruno Mars Concert was awesome.
40,Had a very good time with a group of friends got a hotel and rental car driving around and went to China town a few miles away from my hotel and shopped at the Fashion Mall had buffet at Wynn good food and services but a bit of pricy.
50,I loved this hotel so much. Great location great amenities and the pool 🏊‍♀️ is outstanding. You pay 💰 $30 for sauna/ steam-room and hot tub a day and complementary with any spa package. My room was perfect. Just nice a simple. I liked the pictures and paintings 🖼 on the wall. My room had a t mobile arena view I so wish there was a balcony 👀 Well I know that’s quite a premium in Las Vegas    I will come back to this place
40,It was a second trip for us for Las Vegas and we decided to stay at Park MGM. A big place with large Casino and many bar & restaurant. The park is situated just 5-10 minutes walk to The Strip.    Our choice was Eataly Primose & Juniper Lounge for cocktails. No doubt for coffee and quick bite Starbucks and The Shoppe was the choice.    Rooms are good with 2 queen size bed and limited facility. There is a locker in room but no kettle for tea or coffee. The service was good.    A good memorable experience at Park.
40,I was happy and content from start to finish. Overall the service I received in every department was excellent. The Nightengail suite was nice but the shower needs a lip to prevent the water leaking to the floor
30,"""My unbelievable Bad experiences at Park MGM Las Vegas"" were with the grandios rude inconsiderate discriminatory unprofessional hospitality staff  members on both occassions that I stayed there handpicking the customers they choose to assist and even then their assistance is poor to mediocre at best. The only thing they're good at is pointing you in the direction of a kiosk so that don't have to be bothered in answer your questions etc. and can continue to stand around with their clipboards in hand proecting the illusion of importance."
50,I have stayed here several times even when it was the Monte Carlo.  It is much better now! The location on the strip is great. It is close to public transportation and also in walking distance to lots of places.
40,We went to Vegas for the Bruno Mars Concert. We arrived on Monday the concert was Tuesday and we left on Wednesday morning. The Park MGM appeared to be an older hotel that's been refurbished. Perfect location for walking the strip where shops and a mall are nearby...many places to eat...many street salesmen(ugh); a short but enjoyable trip -- will plan on going back again.
50,The Custer services was amazing! Every person who worked there made us feel important. We had the best steak ever at their Steakhouse resturant. Loved our time here. I would recommend this place to anyone.
10,I was appalled at the hotel condition considering it was recently renovated. Granted the price was extremely reasonable but I did not expect shoe prints or red stains on pillows as part of the package.
40,The Park MGM is a nice place to stay the staff is friendly & helpful and is a great location in conjunction with the other casino/hotels. There are great shows/concerts at the Park MGM. The MGM is across the street and you can catch a tram to the Aria/Cosmopolitan and Bellagio.
10,Over priced over rated Over priced Over Rated Check in took 1 1/2 hours For the money the quanity and the quality of the food was just not there. I found the casino staff not to be friendly. Over all experience for our 40th wedding was not what we thought it would be. Will not return.
40,Resort fees and taxes on resort fees were a surprize to me. Food and Drink was very high priced. There was no coffee or fridge in my room.  A valet fee was charged to my room ( removed after I reported it at check out) and I had no car.
50,Very calming nature like vibe great location with tram access. Updated rooms super comfy beds and pleasant staff Eataly is a must for any Foody endless options of locally made food. Miss the lazy river new pool area ok not great
10,The exposed wiring for the overhead light fixture is the focal point for these rooms. The halls are dark and depressing. Nothing fun beautiful or romantic about these rooms. Public areas are nice but you need a pleasing room too. Stay anywhere else I know I will not be returning.
50,We will definitely be back to Park MGM. Pool was great and the rooms were better than I had expected. We didn’t get to try any of the restaurants in the hotel. Excellent price and location for anyone looking to hang out on the strip.
10,I have been to this casino many times. On my most recent visit my love of this casino ended. I can’t imagine why The management decided to have music blasting continuously throughout every part of the casino. The gaming tables were empty. I won’t return for a long while.
30,The room and bathroom was very spacious we had 7332. Great view of the strip. A/C never cooled. I didn't care for self check-in. I paid prior to arriving & the system tried to charge me again. I had to search for assistance.
10,"The rooms are just decorated in a way that you have to talk about it --One ply toilet paper. Water turned off during the night with no explanation. ""Upselling"" in bars and restaurant (Primrose). A simple margarita became expensive even for Vegas with a ""bump up"" on the liquor used!!!! Check-in at VIP desk a complete disaster. I would never go back to this place again...."
40,The check in process was great very good idea didn’t have to wait for a long line our request was granted ( room close to elevator ) we just have a challenge with the shower floor the drain was clog did not have a chance to call housekeeping about it
50,The room itself was perfect and clean. Bathroom was very modern and clean. Had a perfect view of the city. Everything was walking to restaurants and hotels. The pool area was well kept and spacious. I enjoyed my stay wish I could've stayed longer
50,Such a calm atmosphere. From the pool to the parking lot you feel secure peaceful and happy that you took time off to relax. The beds are super comfy and no noise from neighbors. I think I made the most noise with my snoring haha I will be back in NOV for more peace and relaxation.
50,In an area that is straight up hustle-and-bustle the Park MGM is a welcome low-key addition to the Strip! It's location is great next to the T-Mobile stadium so it is easy to catch a Golden Nights game or a Lady Gaga concert. The restaurants are beautifully designed and all the food we've had has been delicious. I've heard many people talk about the pool being boring but we found it relaxing. I say that if you are looking for something chill something that isn't a stimulus overload stay here and enjoy!
10,Dusty noisy rooms rude staff. House keeping notified room never was dusted crumbs on sofa at check in and hair in sink and bed. This was not addressed. Eatery s tee aff was rude. Discounts never applied
50,First things first... MGM Tip: If you are Active Duty Military or a Vet sign up for Mlife. It costs nothing but it SAVES you. Military and Vets with the Pearl Mlife (which is what you get when you sign up) card gets free parking at all MGM resorts (11-15 dollar fee PER day and varying from hotel to hotel) REGARDLESS if you are a guest at the hotel or just there for the day. FREE PARKING!  We use the MYVegas app to accumulate reward points for various things in Vegas from buffets to shows to comp rooms. This is the second time I've used comp rooms for The Park. I've stayed in a few of the famous strip hotels and this seems to be the best. It's newer so it's a little nicer rooms and overall hotel to begin with ZERO smoke smell which is a HUGE plus with my kids and I. Check in and check out can be done with either the front desk or the various kiosks they have. They have THREE pools (one is 21 and older) and a hot tub the area is kept clean. The rooms are a bit small but a family of 4 can easily function And the employees are VERY ACCOMMODATING! We asked for extra pillows and blankets and they sent them up super fast. If you go out the front door it's right next to a bridge to walk across the street (it's still in construction but just below the bridge is the crosswalk being used for now) and it's in a great location for shops and local restaurants. Where as NyNY and further down to Excalibur and Mandalay Bay You'd have to drive or walk far to get to the happenings.  The one minor issue we had was The water got shut off right at 11 and we were told that it wouldn't be back on until 5am. They provided us with some water to use to put in the toilets to flush or to drink whichever and we could get as many as we needed. They even comped our comped room for that night! Meaning when our room is comped we still had to pay the resort fee of 41.95 PER night that you stay. It was a minor inconvenience but we had left and came back at 245 and The water was turned back on at 3. So in short for a 2 day stay and it only costing us 41.95 and no parking fees thanks to the Mlife card. You can't beat that. We will definitely be back.
30,The concert venue that we had was great… It was awesome to see Bruno Mars there. But the room smell foul and a dog kept barking in the next room over and over. We paid the extra $30 a day for a relaxing package and it was anything but.
30,Rooms are not insulated good could hear next room person talk on her phone open/close blinds and even the TV. Friendly service at front desk and at tables. Sports bar is small could be bigger and food selection is okay.
10,These Rooms have been remodeled on a small budget. If you’re looking for a nice hotel try another. By Vegas standards it should be on Fremont street. Entrance and exits from park theatre and a complete Laos
50,My friend and I stay at the Park MGM every year in September right before the NFL season starts so we can drink smoke gamble and make our yearly bets on football. This year the renovations were completed and the place was beautiful. In my humble opinion they have outdone themselves and turned this into a very luxurious casino and hotel. The new restaurants were classy as well as the French bistro that faces the New York New York. This is also a great place to stay to see top tier entertainment which is what we did seeing Queen in September 2018. This place also takes care of disabled veterans with a special parking pass. We will be back next year!!
40,Great location! Good casino check in is by computer so it takes time and help. Good restaurants! Rooms are very small. The best part is being so close to other casinos. They have an Eataly. which is fabulous! Perfect size for the casino. I have been to the Ealaly in New York and Chicago and this food is just as superb!!
30,Not a good start to our trip and to our first stay at Park MGM. All the check-in kiosks were down all day and into the evening! Long lines and long waits. And when we finally got to a kiosk the kiosk didn't even work. It took 4 people to assist with the kiosk check-in process with multiple computer delays as we weren't recognized in the system. Mind you I had a reservation.  We wanted to love this hotel but it was so disappointing. No TV remote in the room when we arrived and the second one didn't work either. I hope they can resolve there issues! Eataly is a big plus the locations great.
10,The park is a nice place but the staff is out of line the housekeepers will accuse you of using drugs claim that they're going to charge you for things that they should not in fact housekeeper should not speak to you in this manner at all the security is extremely rough and will discriminate against you don't accept there food vouchers as compensation because the moment you try to use it you will be treated as though you stole them and they will call management to verify that they are legit it was one of the most humiliating horrible experiences of my life I completely regret spending my birthday here with 14 of my family and friends the only thing that was great about this entire experience was the fact that we saw Bruno Mars and thank God that we bought those tickets from ticket master and not through the park otherwise that may have been horrible too when I talk to the staff and to the management about the issues that I had I was always treated as complainer or a whiner  When I politely asked to speak to a manager I was told she's asleep she worked all night it's not fair to wake her. Stay away from the park
10,We were excited for our first stay at the Park. We were there for a show at the Park MGM theatre and thought it would be great if we stayed in the hotel. What a mistake. As it was our 40th wedding anniversary prior to our stay I e-mailed the concierge asking if he could make any special arrangements. All I received was a form letter congratulating me on our wedding and offering to sell me some expensive add-ons. I declined. When I used advance check-in I asked that flowers be delivered to our room. No flowers. Rooms were sub-standard casino was small and smoke filled and there were not enough dining options. We had to eat dinner at the bar at one place and we tried to eat breakfast both mornings at Primrose but even though we could see available tables we were told the wait would be 15-30 minutes. The only other choice was to stand in a 30 minute line at Starbucks. My wife's comment when we left was that we would have had better service at a Hilton. Never again will we stay at the Park MGM.
50,Came to see Bruno mars with my wife. Very good location from the airport. Having the concert at the hotel was great . We ate at the hotel before the show didn’t have to get a cab anywhere. Had a very good time.
10,Never again will I stay at Park MGM horrible rooms way to small no drawers to unpack had to live out of a suitcase the entire week horrible drink service horrible MLife desk experience horrible eatery options.
50,The food court at the front was fabulous great gourmet stations fresh mozzarella fresh gelato! The fresh pasta was so delicious! I would eat there again and again. The wait was not long and everything was very efficiently done.
40,We chose the hotel because of its price range location and the fact that Eataly was on the ground floor of the hotel. It did not disappoint. Though the music at the pool was annoyingly loud. But because of the reciprocity with the other MGM properties we had a very nice time at the pool at the Bellagio. We chose a wellness room and it was extremely comfortable. We will definitely come back.
50,Friendly staff rooms are beautiful and beds and pillows extremely comfy! Beds and pillows are usually the thing I look forward to most. The bathrooms were lovely and the shower was amazing! Soooo worth it! Can’t wait to go back!
40,"1st came across Park MGM in Feb. 2019 when we stayed at MGM & walked by & found Eataly on our way to Cosmo for a Duran Duran concert. Saw DD was going back in Sept. 2019 & I started looking for rooms in May. Found a sweet promo on Facebook where rates averaged $45. Sold. As time approached I read reviews that spoke of kiosks. Working in a hotel myself I was concerned. I do have the MGM app. & saw that I could check in online & use a digital room key. I preferred a physical key which was easy to get. When we arrived I was concerned as there is no typical ""front desk"" but rather 18 kiosks for self check in. There were a few associates available to answer questions/help w/ check in. Once we found out our room # went up & immediately noticed the hallway was a dark navy blue. Seemed very depressing. I was happy w/ the room though rather than a bathroom door there is a common sliding door that either slides over the bathroom or the adjoining closet. We stayed in a QQ room (13-116) overlooking the pools & no there is no standard dresser - there are 2 drawers in the closet along w/ the luggage rack safe & glassware. There was a lounging day bed of sorts overlooking the pool. 1 chair & 1 table. We did have issues w/ the remote control not able to change channels by typing the #. We accessed by the ""Guide"" button. Forgot to mention in my hotel survey our room didn't seem to cool off as much as we wanted. My friend set it for 62 & no way did it get that low maybe 70?    For myself Eataly was a must. I've been to 1 in Chicago & Vegas was more spacious & not as cramped.    For those curious as of Sept. 2019 overnight parking is $15/car & resort fee is $37 plus tax."
40,Nice experience check in was a bit cumbersome need attendants assisting primarily first time guests other than that that the over all experience nice. Hotel was nice casino was what I expected and food was good in the few outlets i dined in
30,We cannot believe you are once again trying to reach into our pockets and take more money with service fees on food and drinks. This is causing us to seriously consider whether coming to Vegas is even worth our effort any longer. Resort fees which give nothing for the money parking fees which are a joke considering how much we spend on room food and gambling and now this insult. I hippie you are listening to my feelings on the fees but I also know you don't care and will sucker mostof your guests with these fees. MGM properties have always been our favorites...looks like we will start to consider Caesars properties now.
10,I’ve already provided my experience and disappointment in my original survey at the beginning.. I don’t want to reiterate it all over again.. I am the most disappointed with the bartender Ronnie B’s service at Bavette’s Restaurant.
50,Love The Park. This was my 3rd stay. Excellent service variety of resturants clean rooms. Since I am a senior citizen I am able to walk to other casinos shopping and Shows. The pool area has something for everyone.
10,Worst customer service. Do not bother trying to pay for early check in Because they do not guarantee that you’ll be checked in early. Front staff do not help you and just state that there is nothing that they could do for you.
50,Arrived at the Park MGM with an early Check-In. Check-In process was easy with the do it yourself computer terminals. Employees were very pleasant and helpful. Room was clean but could use some more hangars. After Check-Out in the early AM had to wait for a Taxi no one was present to call for one. Those are the only issues I expierienced. Will definitely stay ther on my next trip.
30,Rooms and hallways are way too hot. No AC in any of the room hallways waiting for elevators. Since I was there on business I was already sweating before I got to my meeting.    Mattress was horrible old and worn out could feel the wooden frame. Worst night sleep ever
20,My wife and I stayed here because it’s right across the street from T-mobile arena. We got a room on the 22nd floor and we were terribly disappointed. The room was outdated old smelly and just about everything in between bad and terrible.
50,Absolutely great hotel. Wonderful rooms pleasant staff great service. Near T mobile center. Two pools had plenty of towels there. Near Tram. Loved the decor. The have self check in which needs a little work but staff there to help. Only complaint was bell desk needed more help on the weekends as they were swamped and an hour weight.
40,We stayed at Park MGM for my sister’s bachelorette party. The rooms were good sized and comfortable. You absolutely cannot beat the location. Easy access to anywhere on the strip although there’s no need to leave the hotel for much at all. There are tons of restaurants we loooooved Lala Noodle and NoMad Bar. Casse at the BlackJack table and Victoria at Roulette were the best dealers ever. They kept us entertained all night! We had a couple issues with the phone in the room and getting house keeping to our room but the hotel staff was very helpful and made up for it. Definitely recommend Park MGM!
20,Walls are so thin that I could hear the guest in the room next to me snoring at night. Room itself is nice but I prefer to have some quietness and privacy when I am in a hotel room. Was told the rooms were renovated recently but seems that work was made very poorly.
50,This was a fun trip with friends over Labor Day weekend. As usual it was a great time. Everything you need in one location ... sleeping restaurants shows casino and sports book. All employees were courteous and very helpful when needed. Would never hesitate to recommend Park MGM Las Vegas for anyone's place to stay!!
30,There was an obvious blood stain  still smeared red and other washed stains on the sheets on one of the beds in my room. My wife and I were quite disgusted but luckily there were two beds in my room so we were able to sleep.
30,I was very excited to visit the hotel and appreciated all the pre-visit emails providing lots of good information about what to expect and what to do while visiting the property. Unfortunately I experienced one letdown after another. When we arrived on a Wednesday afternoon the check in system was broken and had not been working since 8pm the previous evening. There was a HUGE line for check in and it took us over an hour. They did give us a voucher for free cocktails but that did not come close to making up for this unacceptable inconvenience.We asked for a free night and they laughed at us. Everyone in the line was extremely upset they could have turned this into a positive with an appropriate comp for all but chose not to. Second problem: I had pre-ordered birthday balloons and flowers to be in the room when we arrived and even with the huge delay they were not there. When I checked with the concierge the person I had spoken with (Joseph) was not there and they told me there was no record of the order. However the items ended up arriving late that evening while we were at a show and I was actually charged TWICE on my credit card for the same items. Even though I emailed Joseph I have received no apology and so far no credit on my card.    The room was adequate but had a strange design with a sliding door that either closed the bathroom or the closet but not both at once. It was inconvenient to be getting something out of the drawers in the closet and have someone be trapped in the bathroom until you were out of the way. Also it didn't have automated blinds like most other comparable priced properties. The shower was beautiful and great water pressure - definitely our favorite thing in the room. Housekeeping did a nice job other than knocking on our door early in the morning on checkout day. Usually housekeeping waits to clean the room until after you are checked out so not sure what happened there.    Overall for the price paid and the pre-visit hype through emails I was expecting more and was disappointed. I do not plan to visit this property again.
10,Precheckin didn’t work on 2 keyhosk staff can up then walked away. Rooms are small and no water in the room. There were hair everywhere. Discussing! Casino staff were very unfriendly. Restaurants were too expensive
30,The guest rooms are kind of small. We were supposed to have a strip view however we were on the 5th floor and could barely see the strip because of the visual of the roof that was either on the 3rd or 4th floors. So the strip view was seen partially behind a low roof. The beds were comfortable and the bathrooms were nice. No refrigerators. Rooms were pretty sound proof.
50,Place is awesome and will stay there again. You need to go to the Crack Shack great food and service. Rooms were very nice and nicely appointed. Everyone we dealt with make us feel very welcome. We are planning another trip in 3 weeks.
30,I would like to start with the positive since I see many reviewers enjoyed their experience! I am not sure if I am a little jaded with Vegas or my taste is a simply different. Our bed was exceptionally comfortable - I have to say it was the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in in Vegas (and I have stayed at many of the hotels). I enjoyed the feeling I was not actually staying on the strip and the space had a calmness about it. This is wonderful when you are attending Vegas for a conference and just want to escape the noise and hectic revelry!    I am not a fan of the automated check-in - especially when it is hard to find someone to talk to if you have an issue. That could also be down to my age but I much prefer human interaction. The lobby area is clean and fun (with branches of a 'tree' hanging from the ceiling). Everything is easily accessible with a quick exit to ride-share or taxis. The bar and restaurant off the lobby area are tastefully decorated and the bar staff are friendly and helpful.    Now to the subjective negative. The following statements are a reflection of my personal taste. I was not a fan of the decor. When you have the opportunity to re-decorate a hotel I am not sure why dull green is the color of choice. The restaurant and common areas are far more palatable than the rooms. My first room was extremely red and not in a good way! The windows were filthy and the whole place felt dingy. I am not sure why the wire to the overhead light is threaded up the wall (seems a little dated). I switched to a green room which was much more pleasant with an upgraded shower (but still the same overhead light situation). I was comfortable (did I mention the bed!) I was also surprised at the decor of the hallway - tiny tiny hummingbirds and other flying things completely out of proportion with the tall grass - and the neon images in the hallway hub were not in keeping with the theme. Also the room had a vague smell of straw while the hallways smelled a little like an institution at meal time. I did request an upgrade but sadly none were available.    We had a wonderful experience at the bar. Again I must stress if you are looking for Vegas feel without the buzz this hotel and restaurant may well be a wonderful choice. I shall certainly come back and try one of the suites.
50,It was nice but unfortunately the check-in was a mess ! Our room was not ready and we had to wait 5 hours before have our room ! During this wait it was not possible to receive a SMS or email to notice us about our room !
40,"It was overall nice. I just think that all the table operators at the casino should observe the same house rules and be consistent such that table players can keep betting even while a roulette ball is in motion and stop betting when and only when the operator says and signals ""No more bets!"""
50,Everything was GREAT location amenties staff room  only thing my room view was not great only could see roof top & a/c unit outside but I actually asked for another room& was told they would find another room for me which please mealso so much to do on site will definitely stay again my family and I where there to celebrate my 60th birthday Thanks Park MGM
50,We loved this Hotel clean comfortable quiet and huge room brought my whole family and stayed in the suite huge rooms great place. Definitely coming back here. Casino and restaurants were great as well. Middle of strip location easy access to other casinos.
50,Great stay at Park MGM the hotel location is perfect on the strip the rooms are spacious clean and nicely decorated. They tought of everything with the room design..they have many outlets with usb ports and they are motivated by wellness with airpurifiers and tranquilizing scents. You can change the room lighting to either relax or energize. We will definitely stay at Park MGM again.
20,This used to be the Monte Carlo and has recently been refurbished. The changes are mostly an improvement although the loss of the restaurants and stores in the walkway to the Aria is an inexplicable loss.    The public areas are generally good. They’ve been cleaned up and been given a fresh lick of (mostly green) paint. The escalators and lifts badly need servicing or replacing though. They are creaky and rusty with many broken parts.    The rooms are OK but weird. They’re mostly empty space. A big table but only one chair and a couch-like-thing on the window. No drawers by the bed. The blinds are functional (blackout during the day) but old they’re rusty and creaky to move. The pull chain on mine was inexplicably covered in a gross oil-like substance.    The room thermostat lies. Whatever we set ours to the room would end up 5-10 degrees hotter. (!)    Restaurants are good. Though the best restaurant nearby isn’t in the hotel at all - take the tram to the Bellagio and eat at Sadelle’s. It’s amazing!    By FAR the worst thing: Self check-in using a tablet-like device. It’s not optional it’s mandatory. There’s no check-in or registration desks. There is a “concierge” desk and a “VIPs” desk but I never saw any staff behind them any time I walked by.    The check-in tablet things do not allow you to add additional people to the room. So if someone loses their key there is literally nothing they can do about it until the person paying for the room shows up to solve the problem. And even then finding someone to help is really difficult.    On top of all that the (optional) “use your phone as your room key” thing did not work at all.    It’s hard to overstate how terrible this whole self check-in system is I hate it.
10,Problem checking in the system was down more than an hour line. Arrived early with no line and been told to come back later when we came back line was crazy long. At check out being charged twice for late check out and had to confirm it online and three times in the hotel
10,Thought we try something new.. that was a mistake! Online advertising had attracted me to this property. Our room was filthy! Bed sheets had not been changed dirty glasses in our closet bathroom not clean. Terrible experience!
30,This was my first anniversary trip. I called to confirm and was told my reservation was all set. When I arrived my room was changed from King to Queen. A manager told me rooms are not guaranteed. I booked this 6 months before my trip.
50,"This was my 2nd stay at Park MGM. I attended the Janet Jackson concert in May 2019 and Bruno Mars in September 2019. These were both girls trips with 6 of my college friends. Both stays were exceptional. We were able to get rooms on the same floor as requested. I really liked the ""food court"" concept of Eataly. There was something for everyone. The beds are very comfortable and the bathroom is spacious especially the over-sized shower. I will definitely continue to stay at the Park MGM and will continue to recommend it to all my friends!!"
30,I liked part of the hotel room was small I normally stay at the MGM. I will be staying at the Park MGM. Didn't get a chance to test the other amenities. Didn't have the full MGM fill that I grown accustom too.
20,Wish more was done. Nice hotel but not 3 or 4 star. Air and lighting quality is not all that great. Walls are thin and bed is not very comfy. Quick in and out hotel. Spa was not that big either. Dry sauna was not working.
50,Hotel is clean and does offer some value in having the park theater nearby if someone is holding a concert close by. Casino is a little pricey does offer some reasonable slots and tables but not as much as the classic casinos such as mgm. Locations is good too though not better than mgm due to monorail.
50,This was our first time staying here and will be back. The pools are great. The hotel is easy to navigate and closer to mid strip. Our room was typical. No dresser but we never use it anyway. Our room had a couch with a ledge that you could use to spread out what you needed to. Kiosk check in was a bit awkward but there was an attendant to help. Happy with our stay.
50,Had a great time staff were nice and check in process even better! Ladies from housekeeping were nice the pool was nice. Drinks were good! The only thing I didn’t like was that the elevators and lobby by elevator was so hot
30,I stayed at Park MGM for Labor Day weekend. It wasn’t overly crowded which I like. The room was decent just wish the rooms would have more amenities. The bathroom was clean. I would probably stay again in the near future.
30,We were very dissapointed with the small room and no refrigerator or coffee maker. Casino slots were very tight and casino very smokey. It would be nice to have more signs as to where things are. Construction around the property made it difficult to navigate.
50,Wanted to have a small staycation with the wife. Location was perfect! Next to everything! So much do to. Room itself was comfy and really nice. We had a nice view of the pool. Wasn't a fan of self check in. But overall we enjoyed staying there and are considering staying again.
50,Check-in took longer then expected but we were compensated for the inconvenience. Room was clean and had a great view. Stayed only for one night. Brought my son to see Bruno Mars and we had a great time!
50,This is our 6th time to stay at this resort and we really have no desire to stay anywhere else. They have the best rates and perfect accessibility to other hotels. We have already booked our trip for April to stay here.
10,Did not like paying reset fee of $125 nonrefundable fee along having my credit logged on the book for $300 for unforseen charges. No complementary water or coffee provided. One table chair provided for a double occupancy.
10,First impression of the hotel when you walk in was awful. It reeked of a old musty smell. With the cost of the room you have to pay taxes on room and resort fees which was already $37. Rooms had no iron no refrigerator which seem pretty basic
10,The Park MGM was advertised as a new great MGM property. This place was all about something other than their customers. No one offered to help had to ask for info and the employees acted annoyed. What a bummer. Stay somewhere else. This place was really a bummer. We won’t be back. Bruno was awesome and that’s why we were there but won’t get fooled again by the MGM folks. Bye bye
40,Rooms are clean and modern. Staff is extremely helpful. The location and tram service are great. Restaurant choices are limited and price especially Eataly. We walked next door to NYNY where there is a better selection for quality food at reasonable prices.
10,This place is not great. I would not recommend it. Hotel rooms are old and feel dirty. I also would encourage you to look at different hotels within Mgm group before picking this one. Casino is old. Hotel room is old.
50,It was an awesome stay. Very accessible to all the mgm properties such as Bellagio and Aria. What I like the most is Eatalythis place is like you are in Italy. All Italian foods are there from meat to cheese to mini groceries. Most recommendable to everyone
40,"Second stay at Park MGM. Love the location. Staff very friendly and helpful. Attended Cher concert and dueling pianos at another MGM property. We were assigned a connecting room walls/doors are PAPER thin (were told only 20% of rooms aren't connecting)! Could hold a conversation with the next door neighbors. No dresser drawers room to hang 4 items in tiny ""armoire"". Reassigned to non-connecting king room with slightly better closet space. For 4 days we like to unpack and still had suitcases sitting around. Bathrooms are beautiful beds very comfortable. Food was excellent at sports book and pool. Rented a cabana well worth the money for me to stay out of the sun but misters are turned off after Labor Day and it was literally 110 degrees!"
40,Room was very comfortable and spacious for a mid-priced room in LV. The smaller property made for shorter walks to the amenities (unlike MGM Grand where everything is a long walk) The casino floor is not insanely busy like Aria Bellagio or MGM Grand. The pool area was smaller than the big properties but the three pools were adequate and relatively quiet compared to the big hotels (fewer kids screaming). Overall we enjoyed the hotel especially if we are seeing a concert at the Park Theater (love the theater).
40,I decided to stay at the Park MGM after I received an offer for 2 nights stay along with a $50 food and beverage credit. I checked in online and provided our time of arrival. We got to the check-in area which had multiple check-in screens. The line moved pretty fast and I was happy to see that our room was ready even though we arrived earlier than expected.    Our room on the 12th floor faced the Nomad pool party and we could definitely hear the music loud and clear in the room. Thankfully there were no nighttime parties so it was quiet at night. The room itself had an odd layout with the bed facing the window. Typically hotel beds are parallel to the window. There were unusual art and photographs displayed in a gallery style on the wall. As others have noted there is a lack of storage space in the wardrobe and there were no dressers. Half of the space was taken up by an ironing board. It would've been helpful if there was a luggage stand for my suitcase. There were plenty of outlets and USB outlets for charging.    The bathroom only came with a tube of lotion. I tried calling the service line to ask about shampoo/conditioner and was on hold for a long time. I gave up and ended up finding a maid on the way out and she gave me the shampoo & conditioner. It looks like an oversight on housekeeping's part since the next day they also provided shower gel. There were plenty of towels and a standard hairdryer.    The hotel itself was great. I enjoyed the pool and there were plenty of chairs and there were 3 pools. The gym had plenty of equipment towels and water. It was pretty busy around 10AM but I was able to find a spin bike in the corner.    I loved that Eataly is attached to the hotel and the $50 food and beverage credit was valid there (but not at the store). There were plenty of food options and I was glad to have another coffee option other than Starbucks. We also went to On the Record and the entry fee was free for MGM Park guests.    The location was great with the tram and there were so many food options in the area. It would be great if the room had more attention from housekeeping and if there was more storage for clothes. Overall I enjoyed our stay.
50,Great trip to Las Vegas to try Park MGM and see Cher in Concert at the new Park Theatre. Hotel was very good the concert was super..Cher is still the best!  Easy to get around hotel and great auditorium for the concert.
50,I honestly was a little worried when I made my reservations. I initially thought I was staying at MGM Grande and didn’t realize Park MGM was a thing until a few weeks after when I was googling the property. I’m glad I stuck with the reservation. This hotel is very clean modernized and has an adorable eatery area off the strip. Reminds me of San Francisco. Overall friendly staff clean spacious rooms and the easiest check in/out procedure I have encountered in Vegas. I will be staying here again.
50,Loved staying in this new fresh and trendy hotel. I think Eataly is the genius option for an incredible qualitative food court. I would definitely stay there again also I do love the art and the fact that it’s connected to The Nomad!
20,My stay at park mgm came after much anticipation of my first trip to Vegas. I was met with disappointment. This hotel seems nice in the lobby and other areas. The rooms however were like a upgraded motel 6. No beautiful floors or properly functioning air conditioning could be found. THE AC TURNS OFF WHILE YOU SLEEP AND YOU WAKE UP IN SWEATS !! Over and over again. Changed rooms even nope same AC issue. My first given given room was the worst room in the hotel. Picture of the view will be included. I did change rooms however. With a better view but still horrid A/C. It was 110 outside. A/C units can not be green in this area. It’s called cheap ! suffering for the northerners !! The FRONT DESK INFORMED ME THAT THE SYSTEM SHUTS OFF WITH NO MOVEMENT. SO IF YOU SLEEP SOUNDLY don’t expect to wake up in any temp lower that 87 degrees! TERRIBLE. Do yourself a favor stay somewhere else!!
30,The Park MGM used to be the Monte Carlo. Check in and Out is all self done. It can be kind of confusing. Fortunately there are employees there to help. We paid for an upgrade and our room was very spacious. The sheets were stained on one of the beds but they quickly sent someone up to change them.    The restaurants in the lobby close early so if you want to eat later you will have to go out of this hotel.    The Park Theater in the hotel is great! We saw Aerosmith and it was amazing. Will definitely be returning to that venue!    There is a little park across from the Park Theater where bands play and it’s a fun vibe. No cost which in Vegas is rare.
40,We stayed four nights and it was a beautiful hotel. Recently remodeled and super lean. Only complaint is that there is no dressers in the room. We had the equivalent of a small night stand in a closet. With two adults this was not adequate space for our clothes. The staff was absolutely fantastic!
50,Every time we come to Vegas we stay at Trump International because it’s the only hotel we know we can trust in Vegas to be top notch in every way. We decided to stay here at Park MGM because Bruno Mars was playing and we didn’t want to Uber. This hotel is great. The beds are so comfortable pillows are perfect bathroom was spotless overall room we had no issues with either. Whenever we decided to stay on the strip again we will definitely come here. They also have great Italian food options at the hotel and the Casino is smaller and not as crazy as other hotels on the strip so would definitely recommend for families!
50,We stayed at Monte Carlo previously I'm assuming this is the new version of that. We loved it! Excellent location beautiful hotel. Very friendly staff . Had room number before arrival  so check in was a breeze . Loved the early check in option  although it costs  it was well worth it. Would definitely stay again and again !
30,"Ok resort for reasonable price.  Usually not my 1st choice when visiting Vegas.  Ok rooms and casino for reasonable rate.  Missing ""food court"" with fast and simple options.  Location is ok and within walking distance."
50,I had a nice room friendly staff I was very happy with the food location and cleanliness of the property the gelato was the best the selection of food it’s amazing the pool area was clean staff was friendly
50,Hubby loves Cher ‘s music and I wanted him to see her live (I have) great seats and show she doesn’t disappoint. I preferred to stay at same hotel as her show and Park MGM was a good choice. Close enough to shop and try other food venues
10,The entire trip was very disappointing regarding everything at the hotel. We are used to a first class hotel and this was anything but that.We were looking for a new hotel to try but unfortunately we will never be returning to the park MGM
20,There is no Buffett which was disappointing. Plus the parking fee is ridiculous on top of the resort fee and taxes. Lastly the strip view room felt congested and smaller than expected. I wouldn’t recommend.
20,I would not stay here again. The room I paid for with the strip view wasn’t unavailable. I was then told that my 3 pm check in time does guarantee my room will be available but that early check in does guarantee my room would be available in a timely manner by the self- check in attendant Jonathan. I spoke to three different representatives regarding being transferred to the correct room and was promised that my request would be fulfilled. On the second day of my stay I was informed that my room would not be available until Tuesday. Too bad my checkout was Monday. Overall the hotel needs a lot of work in regards to the check- in process as well as coaching the staff in the difference between hospitality and customer service.
50,The main n entrance is just off the strip facing the side of New York New York. It's a little inconvenient but a quieter entrance. The rooms are large and completely renovated. They are eclectic with a vintage feel. I loved everything about my room.
30,I chose this hotel since this was where the Janet Jackson Metamorphosis show was being held. On the surface this hotel is newly renovated & the energy was high. Once we arrived to our room disappointment set in. I need to unpack & hang up my clothes & put the other things in the drawers. There was no drawer space or closet space. The MGM Park is for those that intend to live out of their suitcase. The room safe was inadequate for the 2 of us. I was quite disappointed with this hotel.
50,This was our very first time to Las Vegas and we came to see Lady Gaga. The resort was very friendly and had a relaxed feel to it. I nice retreat from the hectic vibes from the strip! We will be back again and we will stay at Park MGM
10,Having just completed a multi million dollar renovation it seems that no one thought out the design of an actual hotel room. No dressers no work table and chair almost zero closet space. No counter space in the bathroom for toiletries and if you made space it meant the clean towels have to go on the bathroom floor. Public space and casino area the music is so loud that you can't carry on any type of conversation. The designer should pick another career field quickly and the casino manager should be fired as people were leaving his/her casino in droves over the music. I'll never go back
40,Eataly Eataly Eataly. so many choices to eat Italian in one place. Nice renovations from the prior Monte Carlo. Love the new pool area. The pool DJ was actually pretty good. Although 4 stars cuz the room decor was a bit bland.
40,The view of the hotel from the outside is deceiving. Once you step inside it's a very nice hotel. The only unfortunate part was that there was some remnants of previous hotel guest trash in our bathroom that grossed us out. But overall the room had a very nice rustic feel to it and had really good restaurants inside.
40,Wow was this great. I was killing time while my husband was playing blackjack and I stumbled upon this exhibit.  No charge just off to the side in the casino. All the outfits gowns shoes headdress and more. Videos playing so you can see the outfits she was wearing in them. I always wondered what that outfit called the meat dress was now I know it is there. If you are a fan of Lady GaGa you have to see this. They also sell T-shirts.
20,Despite being new remodeled the rooms are dirty. I stayed in a stay well room (floor 23 room 219). Every surface in the room was dirty. The remote had a wrapping around it saying it was just cleaned yet there was something all over it. A brown stain on the toilet seat faucet in bathroom was dirty the vent were full of dust night stand had a layer of dust and so did the lamp shades. Floor was not vacuumed. I did speak to someone and they waived the resort fees and sent someone to come clean. The only thing they did was wipe down the nightstand. Check in and check out was awful. It’s a computer with one person helping. The pools were not heated. The only thing I liked was the location on the strip. Stay at mgm grand. Much better experience.
50,The rooms were so clean and comfortable (wish they had mini fridge's in the room). The pool's were great staff everyone made sure you were taken care of! I took my 24 yr old daughter (her first visit since she was 7) to see Cher and we just had a wonderful girls weekend!!! And Cher was amazing!!!!!
40,Fantastic location. Direct access to Bellagio tram and close access to Mandalay Bay tram makes it very convenient since you can access almost any part of the Strip for free within half an hour. Common areas (lobby casino Eataly etc) were nice our room was fine but overall Park MGM provides great value compared to some of its neighbors.
40,The overall experience was great. We stayed in a Nightingale Suite which was a good size and very comfortable. The shower was great. The room keys became disabled during our stay but a quick stop at the Concierge desk and that was corrected. The staff is friendly and helpful. The hotel also has a tram to the center strip which was very useful.
20,I’m here on a comped stay with mlife. So all I am paying for is resort fees. I was given a nicer room a Night Hawk suite. Not really a suite just a larger room with a makeshift living area. Bed was very low and mattress wasn’t that good mediocre at best. My biggest disappointment is that all day and night I could hear the room occupants next door. Not sure if it’s because there was an adjoining door but it was as if they were partying directly in my room. I understand people like to have fun in Vegas but everyone should also be able to relax and not hear everything being said by your neighbors. 2 stars just for the size of the room. I would never stay here again.
50,We throughly enjoyed our stay at the Park MGM. Recently remodeled rooms are beautifully done. The location is perfect on the strip. Additionally the services we received were impeccable from the Valet to housekeeping and our fabulous waitress at the pool. It was a perfect stress free vacation.
50,The rooms were ok not really fancy the food was expensive but not worth that much  the check in and out was easy but left my ID on scanner . Need at a fridge in room for my meds . Need more disability access
40,Not too bad; great location; I would recommend the Park MGM; convenient to key attractions; friendly staff. Shower leaked onto bathroom floor each time I showered; maintenance attempted to repair but repair was not sufficient.
30,The room provided an excellent view.  Nice room layout loved the pictures. However the housekeeping was well below standard. The inner blinds was  broken. I had to request for new towels  towels. During my stay the room was never cleaned nor was the bedding changed.
20,Look elsewhere that has nicer room amenities especially bath towels and clean smelling rooms. Won't be back here no way. Phillip in Mlife rewards is FABULOUS. Food court has an amazing collections of fine wines.
50,Great stay!! Super clean!! Nice job with renovations!!! Food was great!! Love the wine selection!! Staff very friendly!! The casino is intimate and great dealers. Best view of the Raiders stadium!! A must stay for the money!!!
30,One of the reasons I return to this property year after year is the location particularly now with the addition of T-Mobile Arena and the surrounding park.  Since the remodel from Monte Carlo to Park MGM the property has lost its charm in what appears to be an attempt to lure the middle-class millennial crowd. Minimalist has replaced form and function in the rooms common areas and casino. This place is a great option for 2-3 days particularly if you are in LV for a concert or event at TMobile or the Park MGM Theater but longer stays not so much.
50,Nicely remodeled great food and staff. Location cannot be beat. Not too big staff is helpful and friendly. Eataly was great along with Best Friend. Didn’t have a chance to try Bavettes but will next time.
10,People warned me about the paper thin walls. Well they were not kidding. Had a bunch of drunk people running up and down the halls shouting throughout the night. Couldnt sleep a wink. It was labor day weekend so I get there was a larger crowd than usual but the restaurant choices were limited and what was available was extremely overcrowded and expensive. It felt like disneyland during a major holiday where you pay a fortune and wait an hour for each ride. And no late checkout option not even for loyal m life members. Will not be coming back again.
50,The Park has made a lot of significant changes to the resort for the better. I will be staying here again given the great service  location of the hotel and the competitive room rates. Looking forward to possibly seeing Lady Gaga show next visit.
40,Perfect place to stay and see awesome music! Great location to explore minutes to airport staff is awesome easy transport to wherever you want to explore and the best food surrounding you in all sides!
40,Great place and great service!! Although it needs a bit of redecorating and the carpets need to be replaced!! The casino was great and the dining choices were varied!! I especially love Eataly!! I will be back!!
50,I am 78 and traveled to Las Vegas by myself to see Cher. The hotel was exemplary. The service was good. The seats on the floor at the concert were uncomfortable. Packed us in like sardines. Miserable.
10,Took about 30 minutes to check in with the kios..then check out early was charged 30$ on the card for parking. Ended up pay 30$ at the exit..room key wasnt working.  Not recommended. Bad experience here.
50,If you will be in your room during the day request a room on the side away from the pool-music bass is loud. Rooms are spacious with a couch all along the window. Beds are a bit low to the ground-makes for a bit of entertainment getting up if you are older and creaky!
20,The remodel looks great and there was no issues until checkout. A watch was left in room and unfortunately house keeping decided to keep it instead of turn in. While my fault definately hoped for more from a higher class hotel.
30,I don’t think the price was too bad for a Vegas hotel but there’s room for lots of improvement. Pros: I was able to check in the day before arrival and my room was ready when I got there the next day. A very nice young lady helped me get my room key from the kiosk. The room was immaculate. I thought the room was unusual but cute. It was white beige and red. The hotel is in a good location to walk to other locations. Cons: Most of the decor in the hotel is very drab and there are way too many strange shades of green. The hallway on the floor to our room is extremely dark with shades of green gray and black. Almost scary. There is no guard at the elevators. Anyone can get up to the rooms. We were on the 19th floor and could hear loud bass from the casino or wherever until 2:00 am. Very disturbing when we were flying out the next day. We had breakfast at the Primrose. We had an excellent server named Shelley and the food was very good. However the restaurant was playing loud French music and the casino was playing loud rock music at 7:00 am. We had to listen to both at the same time. Don’t people have any sense there! The casino was a pain. For awhile the machines would not take anyone’s card or tickets. We had to get in a long line to get cash to play the machines. When we left we were charged $24 for parking. My husband had a military ID and I had a Pearl card and we got no break. We will not stay there again.
30,Check in/check out process very easy and staff very helpful during the process. Rooms were average. Disappointed that there was not a coffee maker in the room. Bartender at main casino bar in the AM reluctant to give coffee and water free of charge even though we spent a lot of $$ in the casino. We were told we had to wait for waitress in slot area although the service took awhile. On one occasion was charged $13.25 for a Pepsi and water when going up to the bar from the slots because there wasn’t a waitress. Pool area was very nice and staff there were very friendly. Overall we had a good time with little hiccups from the coffee/beverage service.
30,Read the reviews and was somewhat apprehensive about my stay.  The rooms are small and beds uncomfortable. No problem with noise in  Adjacent rooms although maybe they were empty.  Everyone very helpful onsite.  Doubt I will go back. I normally stay at Mandalay or Planet Hollywood for the location
30,"Booked 2 rooms the weekend of Aug 23 2019. I felt finding the self parking for this casino was a bit confusing. The parking is a bit of a distance but there is a walkway to get to the casino entrance. The biggest disappointment was the check in process. No front desk with a personal one on one contact. Everything is all by kiosk. There were like 15 people checking in and 1 available customer service rep to help everyone. I felt the whole on-line registration/check in was not very user friendly. I miss the old days of having a person to ask questions and just having the whole process run much smoother. The parking fee is rather expensive just as with some of the other casinos apparently. Keep in mind the parking fee is a whole separate fee than the resort fee. But we were able to sign up for the MGM ""M Life rewards"" as a retired member of the armed forces and that gets you ""pearl status=free parking"". The room was very nicely decorated and had a nice couch next to this huge panoramic window to look out over the city. The bathroom was updated and big. Beds were comfy. The noise level was awful though. We could hear the neighbors come in at 4a.m and were loud for hours. We could practically hear their entire conversation. We did eat at the Eatery. I thought this place was too small and so congested with people. It was hard to find tables and to find out what each little section offered for their menu. We stayed here for the comforts of going to a concert at this casino. I don't think I would stay again though. It was just too crowded for my liking. Again I hated the check in process with just a kiosk."
20,Very disappointed in the Room. It smelled like sewer. Also there were no coffee coffee cups creamers in The Room. I understand you would like to keep the guests all in the casinos spending money But coffee tea and water should be available in the guest rooms complimentary.
10,They took short cuts to redesign this place from the rooms to the hall ways to the carpet all over the hotel. The pictures in the room look like a collection of pictures pulled together from a swap meet.
40,This is a very nice hotel and I see that they've added a few restaurants. I've stayed at this hotel before and the customer service is always nice and helpful. But on each occasion that I have stayed there I have had to have my room changed for various reasons. I don't appreciate having to be moved in the middle of my stay. Outside of that it has been pretty enjoyable.
10,The rooms look nice but it’s all lipstick on a pig. The mattress was lumpy and I could feel the bar from the bed frame (like it was a seedy motel in downtown). I had a business meeting the next morning and I could hear the clubs music in my room 10 stories up. My choice was to switch rooms at 1am or they would give me earplugs. How about sound proofing!?! Their response? “The music will be lowered at 2am”. Cool…. Moral of the story DO NOT STAY HERE!!! Unless you enjoy being sleep deprived with a stiff neck and back
50,This hotel is one of my favorites. It's located right on the Strip close to everything as you can imagine the surrounding area is beautiful and very alive at nights. The rooms are very unique with accent walls in red very clean and nicely furnished. The views from the rooms are beautiful. There is a casino on the first floor among many stores and restaurants. There are 3 pools which is amazing. Personnel is very professional and kind. Really nice hotel to stay in while you are in Las Vegas. There is a shuttle service to and from the airport. I definitely recommended.
10,While this is an MGM property it is well below the standards of their other Vegas hotels. The cleanliness leaves something to be desired. Dark dingy hallways and dead bugs in almost every light fixture walking to my room. Once in the room I would equate it to a quality inn type of room very outdated and not very clean. I will say the bed was comfortable.  Unfortunately I was assigned this hotel while staying in Vegas for a convention. I was originally excited to stay here because MGM took over the old Monte Carlo hotel and supposedly spent millions updating the hotel. Next time I will stay somewhere else. Very disappointing. I even took pictures and plan on sending them to the ceo of mgm to show him.  I must compliment the hotel and casino staff. They were fantastic friendly and representative of the MGM brand.
50,We had such a fun experience! We traveled from Park MGM to the ARIA to New York New York New York playing craps from hotel to hotel and we had a blast! Love the vibe throughout each of these casinos with loud music playing throughout to keep you excited and in a happy mood! It really set the stage for an amazing weekend
30,Bavette steakhouse was great. Rooms are basic and a bit dated. Self check in process doesn’t work well. Juniper bar was fun but they told us On the Record was casual but when we got there they wouldn’t let men in wearing shorts.
40,The renovated Park MGM has many things going for it. it is clean innovative and full of friendly staff. The room was minimalist and could use some more amenities. The sportsbook wasn't open yet so hard to review but it looked nice. Pools were very nice. Overall an improvement from Monte Carlo.
20,Did not blow me away. Extremely expensive for what it is. The corridors and elevator areas are soulless and drab. I had a 14th floor room over looking the pools. Really noisy from the nomad pool. No great choice of food in the hotel. No cheaper food court no hotel buffet breakfast. Eataly overpriced and not much choice. Stayed to see Cher and the show is great. Park Theater is a great venue. I won't stay at Park MGM again. Staff were really nice. Though the casino waitresses took ages to serve while gambling. The casino part is OK. One shop there called Best Friend was never open. Park MGM is just not special enough to return to. I've previously stayed in Caesars and The Flamingo much better area of the strip
10,Room i reserved wasn't available so I was given a worse room for the same price. Was told I would have to talk to someone the next day as I arrived at night if a food and beverage certificate wasn't enough. Will tell everyone I know what a nightmare this hotel is although by the looks of it people already know.
20,The colour scheme of the hotel was atrocious. Faded olive green? I mean really?!. The casino floor was being ripped apart for fixing something. The slots malfunctioned and every machine required a hand pay when cashing out even if it was $2.00.
50,The park is always our go to for comfort location but sure wish parking was included. We love the decor and being able to walk everywhere. The check in is easy and always friendly people. We will always make the park our first choice!
10,"Stayed to see cher concert. Show was great - stay somewhere else. Nonstop noise all day from nomad pool area ""day club."" never again. Room was sparsely furnished dirty frayed carpet was surprised to hear they redecorated a year ago.. my guess would have been 15 years ago. I'd look for some place nicer for the price paid."
40,I use to stay in Aria but since last year or reopening I stayed at Park MgM 3tines and I am going to stay in Sep again.    1) parking access is so easy and you don’t have to drive in Strip ( less traffic ) for access to parking.  If you are a member of Mlife use your membership card for inter and exit ( parking ).  2) I had mix experiences for check in-  Staffs are really trying hard to help you out but sometimes it get crazy and checking time goes over the time ( I generally not fan of self check machine ).  And first time I had to wait 45 min because they didn’t have room ( check in by midnight and I email and called them to let them knows what’s my arrival ).  3) there is Starbucks in lobby and Italian market food court which food are really great  Seafood meat chicken  cheese and ........  There is access passage to Aria hotel and tram by swimming pool area  4) room: bed are comfy enough but anytime I compare it with Aria it make me sad but I am much less than A hotel. Shower and toilet area is good size too and generally is better than it use too.  No fridge or kettle in the room  5) I have used  It’s gym and it was enough machine for everyone since not many people use gym in Vegas  Pool can be Busy especially in this season.  6) casino area: you have enough table games to play and don’t forget if you are pro poker or blackjack play that won’t be your casino type.  7) DOES NOT WORK ANYMORE IN VEGAS :  If you heard story about upgrading for free i should say : don’t try it and offer them $20 trick or similar    I am just using my own experience: on my birthday they upgrade me at check in point but during check out they charge for it !!!!  And I been told by front desk: we don’t have any free upgrade policy anymore ( good luck to you guys. Just ask you never know:).  8) there is no buffet restaurant in Park MGM anymore  And finally : yes I would choose Park MGM again see you guys soon :)  Feel free if you have any questions  Good luck
50,From the moment I walked into the door I was met with friendly faces. Everyone was so helpful getting me checked in and on my way. The casino is very clean and not a lot of smoke. Rooms were clean and bed was very comfortable.
30,Hotel is nice the problem is the rooms are too noisy with horrible thumping loud music from the NoMad and Park MGM hotels. There is absolutely no logical reason to have it blasting so loud. I even asked if they could at least turn down the bass. The music shuts at 6pm so we were able to sleep fine but we were not able to relax in the room during the day.
50,Nicely renovated quieter hotel. 3 cool water pools plus party pool lots of lounges and umbrellas lacks fast food locations but might be available in sports bar which was closed. special thanks to Toni for assistance in check in and room selection. would definitely return.
50,Spent 4 days in Vegas was very hot 100 + degrees. Stayed at the Park MGM. Many years of renovation and a greatly renovated Casino/hotel . Congratulations on a marvellous property. We will definitely recommend and return again. La La Noodle is a must try oriental cuisine. Their General Tao chicken is the best.
20,The rooms are tiny and old. They have been poorly renovated. They are very dark and mine smelled of cigarette smoke. From the second I checked in at the automated machine I was disappointed with this hotel. It’s not you would expect from MGM
50,The renovation is nice. I loved the new furniture bed was comfy! Loved EatalyBest friends and LaLa Noodle. Bloody Mary's were delicious . I highly recommend Park MGM. It was great to be right across the street from T-Mobile arena attended a concert!
40,Hotel was average. Has pretty much everything else other hotels on the strip provide. You won't be wowed by Vegas excess like the Wynn but you won't pay an arm and a leg either. Nice and clean and small enough to easily go from hotel room to casino without wasting 20 minutes and a lot of walking. My wife like that it's close to cheaper shopping experience (Ross Marshalls souvenir shops etc. right across the street).
40,We stayed here 4 nights comped in August.    I was already weary of the hotel solely based on location. I wasn't excited about it but when it's comped I guess you can't complain!    Check in was quick easy and efficient. I was worried about this because of the kiosks and needing to link 2 reservations. There was attendants around to help and it went quite quickly.    I really wanted to love the room but I couldn't. I think they missed the mark here on the renovations. I don't get the theme or the cheap small random picture frames! Our room was dusty and the carpets quite stained but we did enjoy the bed and the lovely pillows. We had a view of the Aria and the pool area. We didn't have a room with a sliding bathroom door so had a vanity type closet and a door on the bathroom. I really enjoyed the bathroom. Was nicely done. Not a lot of counter space but you make do with the shelving unit. We had a bathtub and not a walk-in shower as you see in some.    We had minimal noise issues. More from the hallways (thru the door) then thru the walls. We were about halfway down the hallway. Yes it's painted dark but that was fine. Didn't bother me.    What really sold me on this hotel was the casino. I loved the vibe! I thought I would spend all my time at NYNY but I didn't I spent it here. The selection of slots is good easy to get around the casino and the drink service was great.    We didn't really eat anywhere inside Park MGM to comment on. We did check out Haus of Gaga on another trip and it's worth a quick peak.    Access to the strip is obviously getting easier with Eataly open.    Would I stay here again? I am not sure I would rush back as I prefer other areas of the strip but if the price/comps were right I would consider it. The casino won me over here not the rooms!
50,What an amazing stay! The hotel was gorgeous and so clean there were plenty of dining options with lots of variety. The rooms were so clean. There were lots of amenities for all different types of guests.
50,Good experience. Room was nice was given a suite. A bit worn but still nice. Staff was excellent. There to help you with a quick check in. Food was delicious. Slot machines were somewhat boring. Wandered to the other properties looking for variety. Easy access to the arena.
30,I hace be in many of the MGM properties but the hotel and what they offer is great.  We were disappointed with the room  It was old and tired.  Carpet dirty  Bathroom was odd. Not enough towels and no bath mat  The safe would not operate.
50,I treated very well room was awesome people were friendly drink delivery was fast and accurate. Mlife rewards personnel were extremely helpful. The mattress and pillows were the best of any hotel I have ever stayed. I would recommend the Park MGM to anybody looking for a fantastic place to stay in Lass Vegas.
40,The mobile check in was great. Quite simple and easy. The kiosk check in must work. Because we walked over to New York NweYork and the check in line was about 109 people deep. The rooms are very unique and European feeling. The shower is great. If going to a concert at the Park theater you should stay here.
50,I have been to Vegas 5 times stayed at Luxor and Tropicana before so I'm not a big time Charlie I just like value for money. Having read loads of reviews myself and 2 friends were a bit wary of the tiny rooms and bad check in and that you never saw any humans etc but the location newish decoration and cleanliness in other reviews outweighed the negatives. We had e mailed the hotel before and asked for 3 rooms on high floors with doubles not twins the response from the hotel was hours not days so all seemed good.    We arrived last Sunday 25th August about 1.15pm. Straight to the machines and not all terminals were working and we had to endure a 30 second wait for a terminal so all well. Checking in was a 3 minute affair as we had a question and one of the half dozen check in staff helped straight away. We got our tickets and all of us on the 4th floor with twin beds. A quick call back to the young lady ( I forget her name but it began with C and she was from the Philippines) and her colleague who had helped my friend to check in sorted it out straight away with 2 rooms on the 18th and mine on the 25th all with double beds a bigger room with a settee big table and chair and $75 room credit for the inconvenience.    Rooms are spotless service has been excellent and although only 3 days into my weeks stay I cant see any reason why I won't be back
50,The hotel is one of the first on the strip. It fits familyfa because it's entrance is very fancy but yet quite and worming. The rooms are big and beautiful there is everything you need but a minibar. The etaly food sector is excellent .
50,Service pool food rooms were all outstanding- I can't wait for my next trip to Park MGM. My Nighthawk suite was roomy but definitely missing a fridge. My husband said a fridge and a small microwave would have made stay 2 weeks instead of one! Pool wasn't crowded or full of obnoxious drunks. Had an adult only pool for the weekend with a DJ- nice and relaxed fun!
30,Our biggest disappointment was that there was no coffee maker in the room. The bed was not as comfortable as expected. The hallways are dark and dingy. The front desk staff was pleasant and quick. Absolutely no frills that we are accustomed to in most Vegas rooms.
50,I would stay at the Park MGM again in a hearbeat! It was clean updated very friendly and helpful staff convenient location comfy beds check in and check out was a breeze and if you're attending a concert at the Park MGM... the theater does not have a bad seat in the house!
50,Good concerts good food good sleep and plenty of gambling. Went to the Cher concert ate at the on site restaurants shopped in stores and we never even went on the strip this time stayed right on the property.
40,Excellent Service. The rooms were nicely kept and fairly clean. The casino is small but the gaming is varied enough to enjoy lengthy gambling. The restaurants vary as well with Eately being the most popular. I would definitely stay here again in the future for concerts at the Park Theater. Its a great smaller sized venue not a bad seat in the place. Also the proximity to the T Mobile Arena and other MGM owned casinos is an added bonus for other events and casino hopping too.
50,Just returned from a weekend at the Park MGM. I really enjoy the refresh. The casino and rooms have a fresh updated look. The new restaurants are excellent (especially Eataly).  Do yourself a favor and take the free craps lesson. The instructor Sean is friendly and has a genuine interest in seeing customers have a good time.  The Park Theater is clean and well organized. Every seat is a great view and the entertainment is top notch.
30,Seemed really pricey for being like a glorified super 8 hotel room. Pretty small. Had to use kiosk to check in and out and it the kiosk didnt work most of the time. All ten of us thought our rooms were hot.
10,Automated check in is HORRIBLE. No one there to greet you. No personal contact. No one to welcome you to the hotel. As if they don't really care about you. They just want your money. Don't know what to d or how to do it. Doesn't make me feel safe when you have to scan your own ID. After the Vegas shooting Doesn't make me feel safe that everyone is scanning their own ID's. This automated check in HORRIBLE. THe slot machines are dirty and overflowing ashtrays and ashes everywhere. No cocktail service to speak of. Just try to order a drink. But its exactly what they want. Your MONEY - Have to order a drink from the bar and pay for it. Its not enough to lose money gambling anymore they want more money. I did an experment with my Mlife card. Mlife card in the slot machine Lose lose lose. Pull it out Win Win Win - did it for three days and the same results no matter what casino. But PARK MGM Dirty Machines No Service Automated Check your self in HORIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE !!!! Went to Caesar's got plenty of service Clean casino and won a few dollars. WHAT HAPPENED to MGM !!!!
30,Chose hotel on location next to concert venue. Very convenient. Eataly food court was fun lots of choices. Only 1 real breakfast place in the building (at least that I could find). Overall it was a good stay.
30,I would not suggest this hotel because I visit other ones and they appeared nicer but I will do a though job next time. The room service was not that great at all. I would not suggest it for breakfast
40,Beautiful quiet. Great location 👍. Friendly and helpful staff. Spa staff wonderful. Lala Noodles restaurant had great food! I'll consider it highly when I return. It's impressively simplistic. Slept well room was comfy.
50,Park MGM was an awesome hotel to stay at. Service was quick and the hotel was clean. Easy and minimal effort for trash pickup. In-room dining services was fast and food quality was exceptional.(Missing the cheesecake cup already). Staff was also very friendly and could answer most questions without issue and addressing any issues quickly. Definitely a hotel to book a room for if in the area.
30,Basic and Clean with the bare necessities. No fridge or coffee maker. Cups in the closet. Nothing spectacular abt hotel but not disappointing. Good spot on the strip. Was just looking for a couples getaway but I’m over Vegas. Gonna go out the country next time or to HNL... Vegas takes all my coin relentlessly
40,Great location ! If you are attending an event at the T-Mobile arena it is right next door. There are many amazing restaurants to choose from and you can charge purchases items from all MGM resort properties to your room at the park MGM which is extremely convenient
30,If you were up late or all nightyou are not gonna get to sleep in .Maid service starts and doors are very loud all the way down the hall.AC worked half way.Loved the Location it was great.Within walking distance .
50,Had awesome trip thanks to the park MGM STAFF. Very attentive and very knowledgeable about different experiences that suit certain peoples lifestyles from the lying low Lifestyle of the more laid-back to the recently 21-year-old lifestyle that just wants to party and doesn’t care about sightseeing
40,The beds and sleep we got was great. It was almost like sleeping in your own bed. Room service was fast and delicious. The pool side bar awesome. I recommend the Miami vice drink. The check in check out has been the best. It was fast and convenient.
20,Our room appeared to have been very poorly remodeled. The headboard was situated where a closet used to be and the feeling of it was of a murphy bed. No real flow to the design of the room and the TV is placed horribly to the side of the bed. No vent in the bathroom.
50,I was there over the weekend and check in was so simple I was able to do it from my phone upon arrival my keys where ready. Loved the pool area it was so relaxing and great options for food and beverages also!!!
50,I don’t usually write reviews but I was really that impressed with this place I had to! The rooms are very well done the sage/gold/beige Art Deco vibe in this hotel is stunning and my friend and I loved the pool areas and slept soundly every night.
40,Good centrally located on the the strip hotel. Effficient check in. Nice room Though rooms were a little thin. Very comfy bed. Great swimming pool. Everywhere was spotlessly cleaned and maintained.Would stay here again.
30,rooms are average nothing to brag about.. comfort inn was more nicer than this. we had a strip view room unless you like a lot of roof tops dont waste money your further back from strip than you think. we was going to check out and no one was at the desk till 8a we had to leave prior so we had to hunt someone down to give our keys to at self check--it doesnt take your keys. i wouldnt not stay here again.
40,This was our first time in Vegas we had fun but at times it was hard to get drinks. The majority of the hotel staff was amazing. Some of the dealers were a little rude. But all in all if was a very nice stay
30,Room cleanliness was an issue. Eataly and Best Friends were great if I never stay here again I’d go back for these restaurants. Very minimal to no interaction with hotel staff. Great venue for concerts and events.
10,Waited an hour past check in for room. Finally get to room and room is dirty food and crumbs on floor snot in sink hairs all over bathroom floor. Manager switched us rooms and gave us dinner credit. Get to second room and there is a knife left on shelf in closet/ safe area. Very disappointed with this MGM property. Will not be back.
30,The staff and the housekeeping are great The rooms were not so much. We had three rooms one room we had to change immediately because of horrible sewage smell the other room the sink would not drain and the third room the air conditioner would not work. Regarding the smell they did give a new room immediately quickly repaired the drain in the sink and the room with the air conditioner we just lived with. I just expected a little nicer and cleaner accommodations that only received.
50,Excellent location. Good food and entertainment. Would stay here again and again. Can't wait to return. Always exceeds my expectations. Within walking distance to other MGM properties. Easy access to public transportation.
50,We stayed at the MGM park and the location was perfect next to T-Mobile rooms were clean customer service was wonderful. Would definitely recommend this hotel. Can’t wait to come back and stay again.
40,I was a good experience except when we were gambling we couldn’t get service the one time we were able to get a free drink we were at the bar playing video poker. You would think you could get a drink or 2 when putting money in to the machines.
50,Great Hotel starting with check in! Used app and basically had room before arrival. Took less than 5 min to get room keys. Food was wonderful and drinks were LARGE! The dining experiences they have to offer was large. Would love to go back.
10,Our room smelt bad like marijuana and smoke. The bathroom also smelt like sewage. Bell desk was rude and didn’t want to help assist. I liked that they have a lot of pillows but the bed was uncomfortable. The best thing was the parking $24/day but you can park at any MGM resort for no additional cost
50,Stayed in April 2019 and it wasn't our best stay at Park. Had 2 comp nights this trip so we tried again. This trip was better. The room was good. Overlooking TMobile and the noise level was better than last trip where pool music was sooooo loud. Asked for room not overlooking pool and was given a good one. Only trouble had was finding a medical sharps container. Inquired with security and was told supposed to be in restrooms (but they weren't in ones I checked). Security guard who was helping me said they did have one in their dispatch and he could dispose of them for me. He was very helpful and courteous. Really appreciate it!!
50,Our new favorite hotel Park MGM. Cher’s show was awesome awesome. Ambiance of hotel was different and really inviting. Staff servicerooms and amenities (Eataly) were really great. We will be back in September
30,My husband and I stayed at Park MGM for 2 nights here is the quick review.    Self check-in and out which was fine with us but when I checked in the system couldn’t locate my comp nights reservation. Had to ask someone for help. She was so helpful and friendly.    I love the walkway to Aria. It’s covered and convenient.    Eataly is good but a bit pricy. Best Friends by Roy Choi bar area’s interior decoration seems messy. Didn’t have any food or drinks there.    Slot machines are good well maintained. Payout rate is not as good as I had hoped for.    The standard king room is spacious and has a safe inside the closet.    I wish the housekeeping staff would give us an extra set of shampoo/conditioner. We showered about 2-3 times per day per person because of the cigarettes smell in all casinos but they just offered one set. I have long hair so I used most of it. And I wish the resort fee included 2 bottled water per day.    I would stay here again if the room rate is cheap.
50,The Staff provbided excellent service and help from Check in/out to Concierge and others. The general lobby area was very clean. Our room was very nice and clean. Check in/out kiosks worked fine. Staff on hand to help and answer questions.
40,First stay at Park MGM great location. Pool area is small. Nice if pools were larger. Breakfast at Primrose was good and loved LaLa Noodle. Rooms and casino are clean. Staff is friendly and helpful. Bar tenders impatient with explaining how credits work when playing games at the bar. We don't expect free drinks but when we play money it's nice if the bartenders are helpful in explaining how the comp drink system works.
50,Great place great location! Right on the Strip with access to everything. The suite was comfortable clean and had a great view. The casino was clean and well managed. The show venue was large enough but not too large. All the seats had excellent views to the stage. You don't feel separated from the experience you fell a part of it.
10,Not what i expected from a las vegas casino. There was no security guard by the entrance at least some of the hotel has a restriction on what floor you can be in based on your room key. Basically if you are a woman someone can just follow you since you don't need a room key to activate the elevator. There is no security guard. The room was not available as promised and some of the staff was nice but majority of them just didn't seem like they care. They charge for a fridge and my sink was clogged.
30,Idk what they upgraded seriously! The pictures in the room layout remind me of an older person home where they have pictures from the 1930’s 1960’s and current… was weird!    The baseboards were NASTY!! (See pics) there was hair attached to them dust built up on the carpet line.    In the bathroom there was something stuck on the inside the sink upon check in. 🤢🤢🤢
30,Overall the resort is not relaxing. It is incredibly smoky with poor ventilation. I entered at least 6 other casinos and did not think they were as smoky as the Park. On a positive note all of the staff was wonderful!
50,Great place to visit great view staff was amazing I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a great hotel in Vegas casino was cool needs more 3 card poker tables other then that perfect
50,I would highly recommend and will stay in the future. The service was extremely friendly and courteous. The rooms were very nice and mine looked like it had recently been renovated. Casino was nice and the location on the strip was convenient.
50,The location is perfect easy to walk everywhere. The rooms were great and you didn't have to walk for to get to the elevators. And what can I say about EATALY! Food was the best I've had. The theater is also great and so convenient when staying there.
50,Rates top for proximity to stadium and other venues...staff veryprofessional from the time you drive to the time you depart....  Check in and check out are made so easy that anyone can do it.....with assistance when required
20,Depressing room and dark hallways. The windows were so dirty we could barely see out of them. The carpet in our room was stained. We only stayed there for the Cher concert we will not be staying there again.
40,My daughter and I had three comp nights at the Park MGM (from myvegas games). The check in was easy enough as we had to merge our reservations to avoid changing rooms. We had to get our cards reset later but it was quick. Staff at check in were pleasant. The room was clean and the beds were okay. I didn’t mind that there wasn’t a dresser (there is a small stand w drawers in the closet area but I didn’t use it). There is a safe and a closet area with a door that slides to cover either closet or bathroom (a lil more closet area would be nice). There was a long couch at the window which was nice to look at the view. We had a room on the 27th floor somewhat on the side and back but the view at night was still very nice. We didn’t eat on the property at all but we really didn’t stay on the property much except for the pool and we used the casino one night. The casino wasn’t my favorite as I didn’t like the selection of slots. The pool was good as there are three choices we went early (9am) and used the farthest pool where there were no kiddos. We were able to get two chairs w umbrella each day (first come). They have cabanas and rented chairs or daybeds but we only stay for about two hours to wake up. I also loved the Lade Gaga exhibit with costumes! We saw Cher at the Park Theater and she was AMAZING! The only negative was that the doorman damaged my luggage upon arrival but the manager reimbursed me for the replacement value so I won’t ding them. All in all the location of course is good we took the tram a couple of times (to Bellagio) and you can walk to Aria via connecting hallway or take tram. I wasn’t fond of “The Park” there as it’s too much green but that’s just my opinion. Almost forgot to mention that our room was way too far from the elevator so it felt like “The Shining” while walking to the room especially at night as the dark green carpet and darker colors in general make it feel overall dark. Overall it was a good stay and I’d consider them again.
30,We stayed 2 nights because we were attending a concert in the hotel venue. The staff was very nice. The room was quite basic and did not have a coffee maker. There was 1 bar of soap which we used in the shower and housekeeping did not put another by the sink. The hotel restaurants were very expensive even for morning coffee. For the money spent i would stay somewhere else.
50,Excellent hotel will come back and stay again. Room is nice and clean the view is excellent and pool is great! I wish they can have buffet restaurant inside the facility. Overall experience is great!
50,Loved the Eataly experience. The food atmosphere and bar tenders were great! Didn’t go off property to eat it was that good! The rooms are nicely decorated. My only complaint was the carpets on the common areas seemed a bit worn.
50,This was my first time staying at this hotel i have visited almost every hotel here in vegas because of my job working with the airlines i must say i would recommend all my co workers to check this hotel out at some point and yes i would stay here over and over again thank you
40,First time at this hotel and theater but definitely not the last. Hotel was very nice theater was amazing great sound system and terrific show. Pools were great and not crowded which was a real plus.  Rooms were large and bathrooms had great showers.
50,This was our second stay at the Park MGM and enjoyed our 4 day stay. Previously we had a view room but this time had a double queen over looking TMobile arena. The majority of our time was spent at one of the three pools that Park MGM has. We highly recommend having the chicken fajita nachos when at the pool. Portion size is incredible to say the least.    We were disappointed to find that housekeeping attended to our room cleaned whatever trash there was in the trash cans & gave us clean towels but neglected to make our beds. We informed housekeeping not once but twice asking them to please re-attend to our room and make our beds. Each time we were advised that they would. After the first time they left a message saying our room had been serviced when in actuality it had not. We contacted housekeeping upon hearing the message they apologized & said they would return within the hour. Upon returning to our room later that evening our room was still not made up. Couldn't understand why housekeeping would give us clean towels empty the small amount of trash we had in trash can and clearly could not take the 5 minutes to make up our two beds. Needless to say we were disappointed with the lack of service provided by housekeeping.    Also beware of your room keys. If they are in close proximity to your cell phone they become demagnetized very easily which after awhile can become frustrating. Thankfully concierge was a great help with our key dilemma & provided us with complimentary drink tickets while using the pool.    ParkMGM has a great location on the Vegas strip casino is smaller restaurants we found a little pricey.
50,Super convenient great staff nice rooms and updated bathrooms. The hotel restaurants were great! Loved Pre-show Best Friend and post show Eatily! Fast elevators the only thing missing was a coffeemaker in the room- but Starbucks was right by the elevator.
40,Great location friendly knowledgeable Clean and helpful. Pool was great. Food and drinks where good. Casino was good clean good drinks. The concert was superb. Great seats Cher was fabulous. Need to work on better restaurants. Better cost and normal restaurants. Love ones at new York.
40,Nice Place to visit Food was Great Great Staff Cleanliness Comfortable Bed Eatily has some Amazing food- Great Variety Staff was Very pleasent and Helpful Check in and Check out was easy and Simple
30,Noisy halls. People next door scratching adjoining room door. Not too much on service here as most is automated. Not to many budget friendly places to eat in this hotel as there is in others. Room was soooo hot. Treadmill I ran was broken.    Overall though the hotel is beautiful and overall clean.
50,The location is perfect! It is next to T Mobile Arena and close to everything and airport ($11.44 UBER fare) you check in and make your own hotel keys nice employees clean and modern rooms! Easy check out. Will recommend it to friends and families.
30,Had trouble with keys failing to open room door everyday we were there. We were told it was do to the amount of keys we had for the room 4. We have never had had this problem at any of the other casinos we stayed at.
40,I know I'm being picky but with the money that was paid I should not have to manually raise and Lower the blind and shades myself.  Staff were very professional and kind.  Check out the bartenders at Prima they're very good looking.
40,We were at the Nightingale suite.. on third day the room next to us was occupied by a group of ladies and they were busy. The walls was thin and their voices came through the attached door loud and clear.
50,Love the new Park! A great location next to the Arena. Clean casino with new slot games and plenty of table action. Eataly is fabulous as is Bavettes restaurant. Also the Park theater has some great performers.
30,Walls were thin .could hear everything in the next rooms. Had a noise one night that keep up awake. No storage in rooms or frig. Beds where not made 1 night or trash emptied. Casio is average. No stores to amount to much. Pools where good. Drinks where high priced. TV worked half the time.
50,Very nice but my room was far away from elevator I have knee problems can not walk to far but generally was very nice room and good service about casino I wish you are have poker room but I didn't see one I have go to aria for that.
20,Check in at Park MGM Las Vegas is a new hotel in the MGM chain with self check in. Very frustrating with unprofessional check in support. If this was my first experience in Vegas I would never go back. This hotel does not meet the high standards evident at MGM’s Bellagio Mandalay Bay or MGM Grand. It does not have coffee makers in the room or a fridge. Very disappointing given the room rates. The room walls are thin and at night you can hear all the noise. I would not recommend this hotel given the many other choices in Las Vegas where you would be treated better.
50,I got 2 complimentary rooms at Park MGM from a casino game Pop Slots which can be downloaded on your phone. It is free and in the game you ear MyVegas Gold Coins. At first I thought this was fishy but once you redeem the reward (mine was 2 complimentary nights) it takes you to the actual mlife website. The hotel has a self check-in and check-out which is very convenient if you dont like waiting long lines for someone to attend you. Takes no longer than 5-10 minutes and your on your way. The rooms was much better than I expected especially because I saw a recent video review of it on Youtube and the beds were so comfortable. The only issue I had was that I got sick after eating nachos from the bar down at the north pool and I ended up throwing up on the bed floor and night stand. We had to call house cleaning 3 times to have someone come up and we waited an hour which we werent happy until they came because the smell was growing stronger. Other than that the best experience Ive had.
30,Decent location on the strip. Room was clean but missing a refrigerator which to me is a basic hotel ammenity (no coffee machine or microwave either). Bathroom was nicely renovated. Hallways and elevators were very dark and uninviting reminicent of something out of a horror movie. Carpets looked old and dirty. I guess they were left over from when the hotel was the Monte Carlo. Primrose Cafe had great bartenders and the concert venue was fantastic (came to Vegas to see Janet Jackson). Eataly had some interesting food selections. The self check kiosk was problematic and we were told they frequently freeze up when a lot of people are checking in at once. This is intersting as I checked out of the hotel at 3;30AM my husband is Joe 'Techno' yet I still had an issue using the kiosk to leave. The only reason I stayed here was for the concert. I don't agree with the resort fees these hotels charge in general and to make it worse this fee excludes parking (an additional $15 a day) so ....all the other times I've been to Vegas (and the next time) I will stay off-strip. I noticed there are a bunch of brand new hotels on Dean Martin Drive which is very close to the strip. That's where I will probably stay next time since I always rent a car to get around.
10,This hotel was advertised as a 4 star hotel. It's a 1 at best. It's old. Substandard. Check in is a chaotic self check in process. Rooms are almost like a motel. Complaints are not addressed. It's over priced and over inflated rating. I felt bamboozled and stuck at this establishment since a refund would take 7 days. I wouldn't stay here for free.
50,I stayed here because I was going to the Janet Jackson concert which was awesome. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay. I spent every day at the hotel's main pool. The music was great and the attendants around the pool gave great service. They were very attentive. My room was nice I absolutely LOVED the pillows. I never figured out the Bluetooth situation to play music but overall I enjoyed my stay. The location on the strip was great. I took the tram to other resorts and walked to the stores across the street for wine and other things.
50,Our room was very spacious it was called the Nighthawke the shower was huge and very friendly dealers. We had an awesome time playing blackjack where the whole table was having a blast. We tasted some awesome wine at their eatery place
10,Room didn’t provide any tea/coffee or even hot water machine. Bed sheet had stain and water has chlorine smell. No fridge in room. Casino service is really bad dealers make mistakes and don’t provide full detail of game to me when I sit down to play.
40,Overall it’s a great vacation. We’ll surely come back again if there is perks given by hotel. Definitely we’ll recommend it to our friends and family to stay at Park MGM. The shows are spectacular and make your trip more exciting.
40,Great value depending how you book. I found a great deal on my mlife account so my overall stay and quality is worth the money spent. Beware of the daily resort fee it keep on going up every year from all Mgm properties but the services stay the same. Just something to think about when staying at these properties.
50,We stayed at MGM Park for 2 nights. Our bed was so comfortable! Our room was super modern and updated with sliding barn door. The bathroom was super fancy with all new upgraded tile and fixtures. It is a perfect location to walk the Las Vegas strip. We had a great time!
50,We really liked the vibe. It was calming and relaxed. Our kids loved it. Some of the casinos feel like your in a mall but Park Mgm didn’t feel like that at all. The steakhouse was delicious. Breakfast at Primrose was very good. Great coffee.
30,Rooms are great . Gaming floor is small not much of a selection. Eataly is a joke and extremely overpriced for a “food court” not much of a selection of restaurants that are not expensive. Not sure I’d stay there again.
30,Overall trip was fun. My husband and I were more here to experience off strip plans but while here it was as expected. Costs for MLife Resorts are on the rise with parking and resort fees. With that said this may be our last stay at a MLife Resort until awhile.
50,Great location with lots to do.  This was a really a great staycation.  Comfortable RoomsNuce and Quite in the halls.Smells good abd staff is the best and friendly .I was able to be a tourist in my own town.I enjoyed seeing all the new sight that's been happening since my last staycation.
40,Property location is perfect! Great restaurants within walking distance and on property and T mobile next door..Ceasar's is a $10 Uber away. Hyatt Globalist receive Gold M Status! gives you free parking!
10,There are only kiosks for check in and I see why. The customer service is non-existant. No one will help unless you walk over and ask for it. They must not pay the employees well and it shows. It is worse than the airport! Eataly is overpriced and confusing to navigate through. Parking is $15 overnight. The casino is basic. No fridge or microwave in the room. Just a run-of the mill room. Nice mirror for makeup. Bed was comfortable. Bathroom was decent. Toiletries are a step up from a motel on I-95. Found a long blonde hair on the couch...our hair is jet black. Most of the workers could care less if you are there. Very much a free for all type hotel. We had floor seats for Janet Jackson and that is the only reason we stayed there.
40,We recently stayed at this hotel in Las Vegas for three nights with a group of friends celebrate a friends milestone birthday.    Pros:  - A little quieter than some of the other hotels  - Lots of fantastic ($$) places to eat. `Eataly` is a great food market with tons of quality options including wine tasting (located at front of hotel). If you are looking for a quality place to eat this is a great option.  - rooms overall were clean standard style room.    Cons:  - It frustrated us a lot that they charged us 42USD extra per day on checkout for a `resort service fee`. You are forced to pay this resort fee yet in our opinion there is no `service`. The rooms have no coffee machine no fridge the ice machines don't work on most floors and there isn't even a clock in the room. In addition to that you can't even speak with someone at check-in. They make you use a machine for check in. We were a group of 9 people and most of us had issues with the machines for check in. The lobby was full of people trying to use the machines and there was only one person around to help.It took a really long time for people to check in as a result. So I really don't understand how this resort can justify a `service fee` when they really don't provide any service.  - they tried to convince us to go to the Nomad pool party we went and when we arrived two drinks cost over 50USD. As a result we ended up leaving shortly after arriving.  - I have been to Vegas several times before (staying at other hotels) and I found that the lobby of the hotels would bring you directly to the strip. This hotel lobby seemed really far from everything you had to walk a long time through the casino or around the side of the hotel to get anywhere on the strip.    if you are looking for a hotel that's clean and has several great options to eat than I would say this hotel is worth a try. Its a nice hotel overall and our group had a fun time in Vegas.
30,Checking in was difficult the maid service was lacking a large portion of the hotel smelled of smoke a bottle of water cost $6 (and it wasn't Fiji) and my check out payment was screwed up. The security deposit was split between people (on separate cards) but the full refund was placed on one card.
40,The hotel was nice. The check in was impersonal because of the kiosks. In the theater watch out for Stacy who decided she was there to monitor movement. Don't go to the bathroom you may get fussed at by Stacy.
50,Park MGM is close to many areas of Vegas that are family friendly!! We loved the pool area and Eataly is a must visit!!! Eataly was a true Italy experience. If you haven't been there I strongly recommend stopping in to try the specialty pastas and wine!!
50,We enjoyed our brief stay in Park MGM Las Vegas. We enjoyed our breakfast in one of their restaurants. Nice ambiance with plenty of trees. We had to leave earlier by one day than originally scheduled and they did not charge us for the cancellation which was very considerate. We would stay there again when we come back in the future.
50,I had an excellent stay at park MGM it was our first time staying there. Everything was convient even the tram. Great view of the strip from our room. Wish our had a mini fridge but other than that I loved the size of room and restroom.
50,The hotel to stay at because of it's location to everything not to mention the quality of service. The pool parties at their Nomad pool are a must. Anything you may need is easy to walk to. CVS/Ross/Shows.etc
20,Would not stay at Par MGM again. Have stayed many times in the past but the all the check-in kiosks were not functional with no staff to handle numerous folks checking in. The hotel was extremely noisy with people running up and down the halls late into the night. Staff was unconcerned or did not answer the phone when noise was reported. Basically did nothing. Just not the right environment for a good nights sleep and unconcerned staff. Numerous stays in the past were good but I will never stay at the hotel again.
40,The park MGM of Las Vegas what ze very clean facility To staff from top to bottom was very courteous Would love to have seen a coffee maker in the Room A better breakfast option would have been very nice but over all a great place to stay
50,Perfect location on the strip and accessible to all! Lots of great eating and entertainment on property and so easy to hop over to the Aria Cosmopolitan and Bellagio! The rooms are simple but comfortable. The staff are accommodating and friendly. I’ll definitely be staying here again!
50,This place is phenomenal! I would definitely stay here again. Can’t wait to come back. Will use this hotel for all my stays in the future in Las Vegas. Clean fun and overall just a nice hotel/casino!
50,I loved that this property had literally everything you could want or need inside or directly outside the doors! We didn't have to leave for anything. Very cool pool party at NoMad with a great DJ. Eataly was amazing to grab food from. The Janet Jackson show at the property's in house theater was TOP NOTCH and as busy as the place was the floors were very quiet and peaceful and I had no trouble relaxing and falling asleep. I'd definitely stay here again.
50,Loved my stay here the location is great didn’t get stuck on trying to get out off on to the strip the music 🎶 played in the casino vibes all made me enjoy it even more tge cleanest room ever it does not disappoint the park thetre is a great venue to see your favorite acts oh and lady gaga haus display is incredible to see
20,Had trouble finding my reservation at the self check-in. customer service agents were not willing to help without attitude. felt like pulling teeth trying to get a clear answer from anybody. I did not feel welcome here
40,Went to see a concert at the Park MGM and also stayed there. Very convenient rooms were clean spacious and the beds were very comfortable. Great location on the strip. Easy to get to from the freeway. I would definitely stay here everytime I come to Vegas.
50,quick stay at park mgm the rooms are new a nice and clean the bed is so comfortable just stay for 1 night but is worthy the pool area nice and clean . play at the casino great service the eatitaly is great food and a lot of Italian choices I recomend the park mgm you gona have a lot of fun
50,Friendly staff clean and comfortable rooms amazing view and great pool parties. This hotel includes every Las Vegas pillar and leaves you with a wonderful experience. Other bonuses include great spa salon extraordinary location and casino.
30,Rooms decor is not great.. picture frames are crooked .. color scheme is what Planet hollywood did years ago when they first opened .. greenish color throughout the Property is not ummm pleasant looking .. Art pieces here and there are great
40,Great value with extremely great customer service. I would definitely recommend staying here for your next stay Vegas. The only real complaint I would have us there rooms should have a small fridge. Other then that I had a blast and like this hotel/casino
20,If you enjoy hearing your neighbors screaming and partying all night long slamming doors while security does nothing this is s great place to stay. Everything is overpriced and totally not worth it.
50,Enjoyed me stay. Very convenient for attending the Janet Jackson concert. The property is within close proximity to other venues. It was very easy to get a Lyft when I traveled away from the hotel. Highly Recommended.
50,Park MGM was wondering. I most definitely will be back staying here. Beds slept great. Very clean. Housekeeper was so helpful and nice. Front desk was also helpful and nice. Very reasonable to be on the strip.
40,Was in Vegas for several days and was staying elsewhere. Heard about this place and want to check it out. Stayed for a nite and went to see Janet concert great venue and great Italian market place (a must checkout great foods (plenty to choose from) great bars and great services). The hotel is good. The hallway of each floor was abit odd and cool but the room is nice and clean. Overall I like it.
40,Great location on the Strip near T-Mobile the Park Vegas and NY NY Casino. First visit after conversion from Monte Carlo to Park MGM. Decor yells English summer cottage with varying shades of green throughout. Check-in was easy with self check-in kiosks in what would be reception area. Had attendants ready to help. We quickly were checked in and headed up to our room. We entered a dark evergreen colored room decorated like what I envision an English country cottage to look like with gold lamps and framed personal pics throughout; I think they could've done better. The bathroom was basic modern and good-sized. I did like the toiletry items which were a refreshing eucalyptus and mint scent. Large TV could be angled toward one of the most comfortable beds I have slept on. I really enjoyed the king sized dimensions. The view looked out to the top of the casino portionof the building and beyond it you have the Strip. Enjoyed plentiful outlets on sidetables and throughout; it's not necessary to take turns charging your electronics. I know it's a scorcher outside but the main hotel casino areas were cooled so much I was actually cold. We enjoyed having Eataly a few feet away at the hotel's entrance and it really brings some action into the casino. Every evening we would see concert goers exiting Park Theater and entering clubs along casino walls. Good party vibe throughout. Love seeing Lady Gaga's costumes on display in a store/museum promoting her residency at the Park Theater. Janet Jackson's residency brought a lot of business to the hotel as noted by the merch being worn all around. Our first morning we ate at Primrose which carries that English cottage theme as well which I really enjoyed. The service was excellent and through MyVegas we were able to enjoy a BOGO on the bottomless mimosas which I anticipated indulging in but after two large ones I was satisfied. We also were able to redeem a free pastry: the butter croissant was flaky goodness.The waiter recommended the Eggs Benedict which I tried and I'm so happy I did. I requested the egg overhard and thoroughly enjoyed it. The cream the entire order was so buttery delicious from the sauce to the smashed fingerlings. Yum! My husband enjoyed his garden omelette. This is a beautiful place to eat with beauty throughout and not a bad seat in the place. At the reward center I was informed that the $50 FreePlay I bought with MyVegas points was being upped by $40 because we paid for didn't comp our room which meant I now had $90!!! of FreePlay PLUS we had a $50 food and beverage comp which we used at Primrose as long as we paid through our room!!! I'm a gambler but under my husband's watchful eye I was able to play all weekend with a $20 loss!!! Now the casino medium-sized with table bets a min of $10 but truly loose machines so I was able to play all weekend with my FreePlay and $20 which is a rarity because it seems most freeplay is programmed to be tight and wipe you out mercilessly but not here. Casino has my faves but didn't have my Invaders from Planet Moolah😕. Casino lighting was okay as was decor. Visited pool which had so many lounge chairs available and in-pool lounge chairs great touch. Get there early to get shade in area nearest Primrose. Enjoyed a deliciously sweet strawberry frozen daiquiri near adult pool. We really enjoyed our 2Oth Anniversary weekend at Park MGM.
50,I had a great experience at Park MGM. Was there for the Janet Jackson concert. I was surprised by the level of service provided at Bavette’s the spa and show. Everyone was warm and inviting. Spa facilities most comparable to Burke Williams if familiar. I read so many reviews from complainers before going and was a bit nervous. However my experience was quite opposite. Better than most four and five star hotels on the strip. I appreciated the size and traffic being less busy as other hotels.
30,Enjoyed the trip. Hotel is centrally located to where we needed to be. Hotel room could have been cleaner. But overall the stay was good. We went to see Janet Jackson and she was awesome. Eataly was fabulous.
50,Enjoyed my stay here. While a group of my friends decided to stay at the Linq because of its location I chose to stay at the Park MGM and glad I did. Excellent rooms and very friendly staff. Yes I do miss the old Monte Carlo however this a great upgrade.
20,We arrived after 9:45PM on 08/08/19. Was told our room wasn't ready year. Really! After 7 hours of traveling we had to wait to check into our SUITE. The first night was quiet because it was a Thursday. They next two nights a group of LOUD women checked into the room next to ours. They yelled laughed screamed at each other until 4:30AM both nights. Security walked down the hall one night but didn't do a thing except stop to listen to where the noise was coming from.
50,The rooms are hip clean and have windows you can open. The Italian food court is fun affordable and tasty. The staff is friendly and helpful. The layout of Park is easy to get around and the location to everything on the strip is the best. If your are looking for causal fun and affordable check in out...you won't be disappointed!!
30,The hotel is standard typical rooms nothing to write home about.    I had issues that when I checked in there was vomet still running down the walls and no shadower Matt for when you step out of the shower.    The hotel and pool are nice but for Vegas I would say it’s not the Vegas experience one may be after limited food selections and little to no shopping.    NYNY being right next door definitely helps offset this however.
20,For the price this room simply wasn't worth it. From the moment we walked in we were disappointed. It was small no mini bar and no place to put your luggage. For the same price we could've stayed somewhere a lot nicer. This used to be the Monte Carlo hotel.
50,"I stayed for 8 nights. The price was very reasonable due to a special offer for M Life members. Some of the resort fees were subtracted as well due to my casino play. I absolutely love the pools and casino. The staff were friendly and helpful and the room was clean. Some members of my family enjoyed the club ""On the Record"". There are several restaurants with various menus and prices. The location is amazing with many other major hotels/casinos (and buffets) within a short walking distance. CVS and Marshalls are next door and across the street. I stayed here one year ago as well and plan to come every August from now on. I can't say enough good things. The hotel is a wonderful place to stay and and my overall vacation was fantastic!"
50,This was a business trip therefore the price point was great. The hotel is clean and staff friendly. Also it was conveniently located to has access to lots of food and shopping along the strip. The Janet Jackson show was AMAZING! I really enjoyed this trip although it was for business.
50,Having arrived after a long flight from the UK we were pleased to be assisted at check-in by Elisabeth. Check-in although all electronic at a self-check-in kiosk was quick and simple there was no queuing and we were in our room in a few minutes.    The room was clean and comfortable. There were two Queen beds which were very comfortable. The air-conditioning was great (would tick over nicely at 60 degrees - which was welcomed as it was over 100 degrees outside). There was a 4 drawer cabinet in the wardrobe - where the safe was also located and only 6 hangers (we had read reviews about the lack of hangers so had taken a couple of packs of cheap ones from the UK).    The room had a table one armchair a centre bedside table and a long sofa unit against the window. The TV had plenty of channels - we even found UK Premier League on. The bathroom had a large double sized shower a single basin and a shelf unit - which proved ample for storing bathroom bits and pieces. There were plently of sockets along with several USB ports for charging devices. Wifi was great.    The casino was large enough with a good variety of slots and table games. The pool area was peaceful with plenty of loungers around the 3 pools (one of which was for adults only). There was a variety of restaurants and bars - we are in Eataly (fresh pasta which was $19) and also in Lala Noodle - both were really excellent and we would recommend.    When we checked out we were helped again by Elisabeth who is so very kind and helpful and had remembered helping check us in.    We found everyone really friendly and had no issues with any noise in the room or the quality of the house-keeping which was second to none.    The use of the free tram from the hotel which goes to Crystals mall and then to the Bellagio hotel was very useful to escape the heat and rest weary feet!    We would thoroughly recommend staying here.
50,It was a beautiful hotel with clean room and great Strip view after I got a high floor room.  Hotel has easy access to Aria and Bellagio hotels without even going out which is helpful in hot Vegas. They have a nice gym center and many restaurant options in the hotel.
30,The hotel was nice. The hotel had self checkin there was assistance but not really a fan of this option. Did not like the fact of no drawers in the roomcoffee potor refrigerator. Located close to a lot of food locations. The shower was awesome!
50,We stayed here 2 nights for a quick getaway. It's a beautiful hotel. I liked the elevators were close to the lobby and the rooms. Some hotels in Vegas you have a long walk to the elevators or have trouble finding the right tower! This was perfect. We also liked you could catch an Uber or Lyft closer to the outside door. Many of the hotels have their guests walk quite a distance to catch their ride. Only suggestion would be to put a microwave and mini fridge in the rooms
30,Our family (three rooms) stayed here for five nights (probably three nights too long for Vegas). As is the case with other similar casino/ hotels we have stayed in one tends to be just a number and personal service is distant. Our rooms were large clean and comfortable but lacking in some of the little touches one gets in most Asian hotels – things like coffee/ tea facilities toiletry accessories and mini bar. It was very hot outside during our stay and we found the interior temperature quite a contrast which made it a little uncomfortable at times especially in the main public areas. There are no dedicated meal (breakfast/ dinner buffet type) areas however there is a food court – Eataly where a variety of good food can be had. There is a nice bar lounge area off the lobby – Primrose. Service there is a little slap dash though. You can easily be forgotten we found. Overall it was a case of “ it is what it is”. A place to rest ones head!
30,Nice New Hotel Lot of places to eat we especially liked the Eataly which was like a public market. Don't book a strip view on the Weekend unless you want to be kept up all night by the loud vibrating music. Very impersonel had to wait in a long line to get any assistance from an actual person. There is a monorail that is free and goes the hotel to City Venter Aria and Bellagio pretty frequently but a long walk and lots of stairs to use it. Gym was nice
50,Loved our stay at Park MGM. From the dining choices to the friendly staff and everything in between. Went to Janet Jackson during our stay and really enjoyed the Park Theatre. Sound was amazing and was a great smaller venue! We'll be back
40,Newly updated with great places to eat in the hotel. In the middle of the strip is nice as well. Close to the stadium and theater. Price for stay has been fair with early booking. Overall you won't be disappointed staying here.
50,This was our 2nd visit to Park MGM and we're glad we started coming here. I feel it's got a boutique feel to it without the extra cost associated with it. We had a great time gambling the restaurants are terrific and even managed to see the Janet Jackson concert. Normally we've stayed at MGM Grand but this is now the place we'll stay for future visits.
50,Overall experience is goooood. The only problem is I booked two rooms but they were under different names so it took a while for us to check in. The room is good and transportation chain is also good.
50,Park MGM was a very nice place to visit. Our stay was very enjoyable nice pools great staff clean rooms. We did not like the beds were not comfortable to us. But overall very nive place to stay. Recommend
40,Decided to take a three day getaway from Los Angeles.The Hotel was the old Monte Carlo. I like the easy check in with no need to stop at the front desk. If one needs to there are various employees in eye shot to assist.. So the pros...kick ass music throughout the entire hotel. The pool areas were nice and well maintained. The food choices cesent also. We stayed in the middle of the week so some of the pool bars were closed. I recommend the Bloodie Mary's and the Nachos for a pool side snack. The service is excellent! Everyone was friendly and made the stay very comfortable. The rooms are dark we bad the green room. Very retro east cost clean vibe mid century with a touch of 20's. I liked our room very high up and the spa area was nice also. We had a non smoking floor and never a whiff. The beds we very cozy and the velvet sofas added a nice touch. My only cons would be one had to request a mini fridge or microwave if needed. Great location and a laid back atmosphere! Fun place to stay and will return.
40,Location was great choice of places to eat great disappointing not to have anywhere to keep water cold or a kettle for a cup of tea. America frustrating with so many hidden costs resort fees taxes mandatory tipping etc. having said this great place to stay.
40,Nice hotel. But the carpet on the hotel rooms is very dirty looks like its burnt. Also the hallway lighting is too dim. But other than that great hotel location and staff is very friendly! Pool area is nice and good slots. I like the walk way to the Aria very convenient.
30,Carpet dirty security breech no mini fridge no COFFEE  I have been planning this trip for a year love the Jackson 5 the Jackson and more specifically JANET JACKSON AKA DAMITA JO  I was so looking forward to this and thought why not stay where venue was WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT  The room was musty damp carpet dirty SECURITY BREECH no mini fridge no coffee just a HUGE HUGE LETDOWN but JANET WAS GREAT
50,Had an amazing time at the Park. I'm not one for drinking or casinos and the Park suited me well! There are great restaurants like Primrose. You don't have to walk through a casino to get to the guestrooms. The pool area is amazing! And there is quick access to other hotels via tram. Had a great time! Will stay again when I return to Vegas!
40,Great resort. Bathroom cleanliness was lacking. Hair everywhere. I had booked the wrong date and they accommodated us anyway so I didn't complain. NoMad pool is awesome but expect premium bar prices. Much better hotel than NyNy. However cheaper happy hour at NyNy.
20,Update: I reviewed this property when i stayed here in 2018. Trip advisor deleted my review per the hotel had finished renovations ????ugh ok . I included my previous review below.    I visited Las Vegas this past weekend. I was not staying at the Park MGM but i did make sure to stop by and check it out. The inside was absolutely beautiful. The remodel looks amazing and there are so many restaurants! We ended up stopping at the Nomad bar for a bite to eat and a couple of drinks before we went out for the night. The restaurant was beautiful and moderately busy and had live music ! The music was extremely too loud and we had to yell to speak to each other but we understood the vibe. Our server was nice but our food took forever to come out ! I only ordered fries and my friend ordered a burger (which didn’t even come with fries) the food took over 25 minutes to come out ! It was insane. I can only imagine the wait of the restaurant were actually busy. Overall beautiful place with great updates. Definitely catered to adults and not so kid friendly.    Previous review from June 2018 (Memorial Day weekend hotel stay)    Wow ! What a terrible experience. I guess this hotel used to be the Monte Carlo. They are still in progress with the remodeling but that does not really effect the casino or lobby area. I checked In alone on the first day! It was my birthday and i was tired from the long trip! There are self service kiosks in the lobby so i hopped on one and started the process. Once i was done the key did not come out. I walked up to the desk because the front desk agents on the floor were busy helping other guests and the front desk was EMPTY. I was told by the man at the desk that the front desk was only for premier guests and i would have to wait . ALL I NEEDED WAS MY KEY! I go back to the kiosk and wait and I’m completely ignored. I start crying hysterically and one of the agents comes over and tries to help . I told them the situation they upgrade my room to a suite but a $75 credit on my room and give me my key! The room was great. There were earplugs on the table to help you sleep when the construction was going on! My friends checked in the next day told valet to put the car on the room (19 301) .    Valet never charged the parking to the room  so after we checked out and went to get the car Sabrina  the rudest person i have ever met  told us that we never paid . I told her we put it on the room and she said they never charged us and it was too late to do it now ! So we paid cash and i asked to put the points on my mlife account. She said it wouldn’t make a different unless I’m a platinum or premier guest. Ok thanks. So the valet brought the car around and ran off. They did not help load our 643677 million bags . I got very upset and complained to the valet desk. Michael (who is the best part of the stay) loaded up all of our bags with a smile in the HEAT and apologized and asked if there was anything else he could do to help! AMAZING SERVICE MICHAEL!    Also there were multiple charges on my account that were not mine! Turns out there is the same EXACT room (19301) at the MGM and i was getting that persons charges (Darrien Hill) ! I went to dine at the cabana at the MGM Grand and i was given a receipt for my room but for a different name! I told them that it wasn’t my charges and i was going to close out in cash. They asked me if i knew that person i said no but that is my room number . We figured out that the rooms were the same just different hotels. The server said she would not charge my room for it but she ended up doing it anyways and it was on my bill! Not only was my stay horrible but your staff exposed Darrien Hills guest information to me. I work at a hotel in San Diego and i was expecting more from an MGM property.
50,I would recommend this facility easy check in and out great location easy access to public transportation also shuttles available for convention visitors very clean facility the staff was friendly & helpful and the vaule was great.
10,"I would never stay at the Park MGM again. My wife and I spent a week here and regret it. We love Las Vegas but not Park MGM and should have gone to another Hotel. Why you might ask ?    They only have an automated check in facilitated by a number of kiosks containing computer touch screens scanners and printers. There are no signs or clear instructions about how you need to check in. It took seven attempts to get the system to recognise our booking it didn't recognise our passports nor credit card etc - over 1 hour at the kiosk. Even worse the staff they have assisting at the check in were rude and if you had an issue (as everyone did) they said ""wait"" but did not return to assist. We had pre-paid but the Hotel said we owed for accomodation - more time spent on this BS process. You are offered room upgrade but are treated like crap if you reject it. Check out is also automated either via TV or a lovely little kiosk - ""sorry your name or booking is not on record"".    No refrigerators in room only a small ice bucket and ice dispenser on each floor. My tip is use one of the room bins for ice. There is also a drink vending machine in ice area that charges half the price than hotel store outlets. Room is not nicely appointed basic and eclectic. No compendium or usable TV based service info.    Starbucks on site is always flat out. Dont queue for an hour go elsewhere and not the Hotel breakfast restaurant unless you like paying triple. The Italian Eataly food court is one big joke. Too many vendors hardly any seating and very expensive. If you do eat there secure a table and chair before going off to order & good luck if you are solo. Better still walk across to New York New York and eat in their food area. More room better food variety and less expensive.    Still trying to work out what the USD$45 daily Resort charge was for - expensive ice ?    Best attribute but unadvertised is the free inter-hotel tram service. A monorail type system runs between Park MGM Aria & Bellagio. There is another that runs between New York New York Excalibur Luxor & Mandalay Bay.    If you want a nice Hotel in the centre of the action go for Mirage or Paris. Make sure it has a human check in presence. Best overall tip I can give is to not stay at Park MGM."
50,The new park MGM has eataly a new high end food court with so many choice to eat at. The beds in the room are the most comfortable ever. Safe walking around at all hours. Easy self check in with help around if needed.
40,Really cool Italian market with many different shops and eateries to choose from. A little pricey for what it is but it’s Vegas what isn’t. Had the very best chicken salad sandwich on a croissant there and was fun to look around as a a quick stop on our walk down the strip. Great stop for a quick bite to eat and a beer.
40,I’ll be back out sometime soon to play. I enjoyed myself and always have a great time on your property. I’ve been visiting MGM for the last 20 years and Look forward to many more. Please send my any promotion    Adam clay
30,IAug 14 2019  Compared to the other MGM owned properties this one fails to live up the MGM brand in terms of quality and amenities. The standard king room though bigger than the Grand does not meet the quality. The pool was basic and the onsite options were not what one would have expected from MGM.
50,Great place to stay and play had a great time n wonderful noodle at la la land plus the tram is in the back so very easy to go other casino save my a lots Uber ride the pool was a great place to relaxed
40,Have stayed here twice; both times for business. The location is fantastic and it has some of my favorite restaurants. We ate at Best Friend Lala Noodle and Eataly and all are amazing! The gym also was very good - better than expected for sure. The pool is adequate - not amazing but nothing wrong with it. It did take us a long time to order and get our drinks. The rooms are newly refurbished and very adequate. Again nothing amazing but nothing at all wrong with them *except I would have loved a mini-fridge and a few more drawers. Also easy in and out if you have and need a car.
10,"I have a business conference here in Las Vegas for 10 days and decided to stay at Park MGM for a try since the reviews seems good the hotel looks decent and the average pricing for my 10 days stay was around $150/night which was pretty good deal. I needed a credit card authorization form sent to my workplace for processing and everyday for the last 5 days I came down to talk to the front desk and all they could tell me is the head cashier is not here and"" there is nothing they can do even if they are managers"". I asked to forward the message to the Head Cashier but days after days nothing happened. I usually don't write reviews as I'm pretty patience with people and understand sometimes people forget things get dropped that's normal but if a hotel this size has to be reminded multiple times and still can't get the work done that's very frustrating. I want people to know if you stay here expect bad services from the front desk period. The hotel is decent and the cleaning staff is very nice (at least from my experience). There is one person from the front desk that's also very nice her name is Jess. Anyhow this is the first time I stayed at Park MGM Las Vegas and it will definitely be my last time."
40,Friendly staff. Easy check in and out. Affordable. Great location. We had a good time. Rooms are cosy and clean nothing fancy but overall nice Do not hesitate to make Park MGM your next destination! Above my expectations....
30,The only thing I did enjoy was the Janet Jackson concert. I requested a King Room ended up with two Queen bed. The Air Conditioner unit made a loud noise each time it cut off all night. There were loud noises all night coming from the room next door. I was moved to a different room the following day. The room was a King room and still the room next door was noisy. The day I checked out I was charged a resort fee I was never informed of this fee. I was told it was for internet pool usage and towels. I never used the pool so I didn’t feel I should have to pay this fee.
40,Love this hotel! I hate Vegas in the summer because it's too hot to go out and do anything. But they have Eataly in the hotel so I practically didn't have to leave. They have a wide variety of food I ate there 3 or 4 times and had 3 or 4 different things. The Pizza a la Palla was the best. Pizza by the slice not so good kind of stale.
40,Everything was previously explained. I would stay again but it will not be my 1st choice. Check in and check out was the best part of my stay. Extremely convenient to the exciting areas on the strip. :)
20,"Very odd room - no dresser... only 2 tiny drawers in the a tiny closet to store clothes. The door to the bathroom is also the door to the closet. I downloaded the app to check in and it acknowledged that I checked in but still said I had to go to the desk to pick up keys.... the ""use your phone as a room key"" thing didn't work at check-in. Staff wasn't very friendly especially in Eataly and when calling the front desk."
10,Wifes earings were stolen from her luggage in our hotel room. The bathroom had very long black hair on the floor when we arrived. The rooms feel small and dated but at least the did have plenty of outlets which was a plus. Eately was amazing but u dont need to stay in hotel for that.
50,Great location and close to everything. Awesome service. Staff very helpful and friendly. Pool and jacuzzi was great. New restaurants were great. Early was great. Tried La La Noodle was also great. Definitely comming back
50,Are room wasnt ready for us though we did have to wait on it but the staff everywhere we went in this casino was very helpful. Any questions we had seemed like everyone could answer from the maids to the checkout people. Definitely will be coming back!
10,Expect less and you'll be fine. Expect more Resort Fees yet get no unique services. Expect a unclean room with a mattress that needs to be replaced. Expect air so dry you'll get sick from your stay.
50,Outstanding! Did a cyber security work shop and pleasure with my family to include my grand kids. Probably the best location great entertainment ( Janet Jackson) was there. Across the street at the New York New York there were entertainment for my grandchildren and lots of restaurants to choose from.
40,we came to see Janet Jackson the show was awsome..the theater was right next to the hotel..the after party line was to long they werent letting people in we had a wrist band..we left to do something else..hotel had a FedEx ofc so we shipped all of our shopping items home to make our luggage lighter..the hotel rm had a slideing barn door i didnt like it ..couldnt close it completely and if someone was standing on the other side of the door we would get hit by the sliding door..i'd like to see more African Am.superstars on stage at the theater
40,Loved the hotel. Friendly staff clean hotel and comfortable rooms. I definitely recommend this hotel. The rooms are very modern and you do not hear the hustle and bustle of the busy Las Vegas strip or the casino and busy night life taking place downstairs.
20,Room and floor smelled like mildew. The carpet in our room was torn at the entrance of the bathroom. Everything was overpriced for example a Pepsi at the vending machine was charging $3.00 for a 20oz and the same drink at the gift shop was going for $4.75!
50,Excellent location at the foot steps of ARIA for a fraction of the price. Good restaurants love La La Noodle. Very very soft and comfortable beds and great showers. Clean rooms and friendly staff. I would stay here again.
10,WiFi didn’t work after spending over 30 min on phone with tech support had to use my cell phone hot spot. With AC on 60 still room wouldn’t cool maintenance came and changed air filter and said that was the problem. Room was so hot had to stay in my friends room at hotel next door.
50,We always stayed at the Monte Carlo and were looking forward to checking out the new hotel but I was concerned about staying here at the Park MGM after reading all these reviews. We’ve been here 3 days and have 2 to go and have not had to deal with one of the negative comments I read.  From the beginning it’s been fantastic. Check in was a breeze staff very friendly and helpful. Been up and down on the slots but have had plenty of bonuses which are always fun.Never a problem getting a free drink while playing but be sure to tip so you have the same experience. Pools are great and open til 8. As for the paper thin walls we haven’t heard a thing  it’s like we have the floor to ourselves. Room is clean and housekeeping has done great job. Love the remodeled rooms and bathroom(not a ton of drawer space but more than enough that we have made it work no problem)  Looking forward to another couple good days and will definitely be back.
50,great place to stay! I enjoyed my stay here at the park MGM. I would recommend this location for future stays.  cant wait to come back with my family on our next trip. Thank you Park MGM will see you soon
50,Majority of our stay went well. Checking in wasn’t as easy as I have experienced in the past. Rooms were of good size. Clean. Food/restaurant choices were plenty. A few pools to choose from. Overall awesome experience!
50,I was pleasantly surprised my by exceptional experience at Park MGM. The rooms were great beds extremely comfortable the dining options were wonderful and all of the food was delicious. The staff was very friendly and helpful. On the Record was a very nice club and I enjoyed the atmosphere. I highly recommend this hotel if you are planning to visit Vegas. It's located right in the heart of the strip so easy access to all sorts of activities.
30,As title says. Bed had no support and was uncomfortable; walls were paper-thin to where I literally heard neighbor convos; shower felt like someone spitting on me.    Casino and offerings were super nice though.
50,Our trip to Las Vegas was for pure pleasure Janet Jackson Residency was the main reason. We booked the to stay at the Park MGM because of the location of her Residency. This was my first trip to Las Vegas and I was truly amazed by the night life and the convenience of the taxi/Uber service. The Park MGM is wonderful place to stay everything we needed/wanted is right there.👏
50,newly renovated centrally located amidst all casinos awesome site when walking in the front door of the Eatalypool is second to none slots do pay has a variety of new games and denominationscheck in is a breeze with very helpful friendly staff.
50,The newly remodeled rooms were very good clean and may the stay one to remember! If you are looking for a clean contemporary room that is close to everything this is your place to stay. Parking is close and easy to access the casino.
40,The Park MGM was a great hotel to stay in. The staff was friendly and the service was prompt. Everything was extremely clean. The casino was spacious and lively. I would highly recommend to anyone thinking of going to Las Vegas.
40,If you are traveling to Las Vegas be aware that the sportsbook and restaurant at the Park MGM is under construction. They expect the sportsbook to be completed by the beginning of football season. Everything else about the hotel (other than resort and parking fees) was ideal.
50,We really enjoyed our stay. The self check in/check out was very innovative. The staff was nice. Biggest plus was location. It was extremely easy to hit the other hotels via walk or tram. I would stay there again. I never had a chance to try the restaurants in the hotel. Eataly was interesting.
40,Stayed there because we had tickets to see Janet Jackson at the Park Theater. Day before got an email that said I could pre-check in. It didn’t work. Called and was the system was having issues. Also couldn’t check out using the TV option in the room was told that feature wasn’t Available so guess system problems for 4 days. Kiosk check in was okay.    Room was nice walls are thin. Could use updates as the carpet was old and so was the furniture. Room was clean.    Location is nice and with Eataly attached to it you have great food choices really close.
40,47 years Steak house was excellant. Not busy and treated well. Menu fit our style. Eaterly are not very impressive. No early moning choices except starbucks. Gym was well equiped and open 24/7. Geting to be a lot less choices. hope stay in business.
30,For this hotel to be new it was not what was expecting. I was over charged twice and only compensated once with a free drink. The staff was not friendly at all and I only encountered only two that was helpful.
10,If you want to be treated like a low class unwanted vagabond off the street this is the hotel for you. Staff members acted like they could care less about your questions and needs. Lenny at Juniper lounge Took it to a new level with his condescending disrespectful rude behavior. For spending nearly $3000 at this hotel alone you would think that the hospitality would be above and beyond we were sorely mistaken.
10,Remodel what? Place is terrible remodeled they say....I think I’ve stayed in nicer mobel 8 the colors are horrible would never go back even given the free room on which I was given I’d rather stay on the streets than mgm park
20,I was here for the first time on a business stay. I have been going to vegas more than 25 years and have seen the vast changes in the hotel rooms prices and policies. This was a sparse basic guest room. Calling this hotel 4 star I can only say that the vast majority of Las Vegas hotels are way overrated in this regard. If they have a huge fountain outside its called a 5-star hotel. This class of room falls into the 75-80.00 a range if not less throughout most of the US. Except the rate was $300.00 with a 42.00 resort fee plus tax. The resort fees another fraud. This was a rebranded Monte Carlo hotel. I am reviewing the basic guest room. not an upgraded suite or anything. I can say most guest rooms in Las Vegas are nothing too exciting. They cut every corner possible.
50,Location is great and dining options can't be beat. Casino is average at best. No poker room or sports book. Rooms are adequate and the pool area is small but manageable and not a huge party. Would recomend for just about anyone.
30,We stayed for 5 days choosing this hotel for it’s location which is nice. This hotel has kiosk check in to save time. It does NOT save time because it doesn’t work and there is one employee to handle everyone at the kiosks as well as handle any concierge needs. The rooms are spacious clean and comfortable. The bed was really comfortable and we both slept well. There are also several place to charge phones iPads etc. The walls are paper thin! Pack ear plugs if you want to sleep through the night. You will hear EVERYTHING in the hallway as well as your neighboring rooms.  The casino has all of the usual games. Drink service was lacking but we found that to be true everywhere we went. There is a CVS next door and we would just buy water or beer there. We would go to the bar for an actual drink. If you like wine Eatily seemed like the place to go. Eatily also seemed like a place to grab dinner but not so much a late night snack (unless you want to pack $42 for a cheese and salami plate). There is a Starbucks but it’s severely short staffed. We went there once. It took an hour to get a coffee with one person on the register one person making drinks and one person cleaning and grabbing food orders. I grabbed a Cold brew at CVS next door. My biggest issue was the pools. There are 3 pools and one large hot tub. None of the pools are adult only. Children were using the loungers on the sun decks as slides. Every single sun deck lounger was part of their slide game. We got into the hot tub to avoid that only to have 12 unsupervised children end up jumping in the hot tub. I mean that literally they were treating it as a pool. One child jumped in as I was moving and grabbed my bathing suit bottoms to pull herself up. She said sorry and went back to jumping in again. There is a sign that says no unsupervised children under 12 but it’s not enforced. The other two pools were just as rowdy with children running on the sun decks. I wish that the hot tub and pool by it were adult only so child free adults could enjoy time at the pools as well. The location of this hotel is it’s only redeeming quality. It gives you quick access to several other casinos.
20,Location is good but the room sucks. It used to be Monte Carlos which I had stay in the past and overall it was good. Since they remodeled I decided to give it a try but to be honest I don't see much changes. The room had either blood or lipstick stain and the hallway is dirty leading to the room. I would not stay at Park MGM my first and my last.
40,Great stay at Park MGM Las Vegas. My sister was attending a conference at the MGM (which was sold out) so it was the perfect location right across the street from the Grand Garden Arena and lots of restaurants. The rooms are modern and the hotel is very clean.
20,"Since the hotel Monte Carlo became Park MGM it has lost a lot of its charm. It now completely lacks personality. Granted its location is great and there is a free tram that takes you to the Aria and Bellagio.  Families with young children are no longer welcome it seems since the food court and budget friendly buffet have disappeared. In its place is now Eataly set up like an Italian street market with different stores where you can buy all kinds of italian delicacies like wine coffee pastries breads foccacia pizza pasta icecream etc. Great quality but at very high prices. No wonder that the hallways are littered with take out pizza boxes that people leave outside their rooms. There is no reasonably priced food to be found in the hotel. Luckily right next door is the Aria hotel where they have a really nice buffet.  Park MGM wants to present itself as a higher end hotel but it doesn't offer the kind of service you would then expect. One night our room was not serviced (eventhough we had been out from 9 am till 4 pm. and left no sign on the door!)  The rooms are basic but quite OK. No fridge though because understandably they want you to get cold drinks from the bar or vending machine.  Las Vegas is constantly changing it seems that it is now more focused on getting revenue from food beverages and shows than from gambling. Prices have gone up considerably and it wants to attract more affluent people especially people with no children. (Which is a good thing because it really is not a good place to bring young children come to think of it.)  One cost saving measure the hotelmanagement might consider is to get rid off the so called ""life guards"" at the swimming pools! Just put up a sign ""Swimming at your own risk"". The demeanor of some was downright appalling! One girl was constantly yawning (apparently she had had a heavy night) swivelling her chair so that she had turned her back to the swimmingpool inspecting her nails plucking at her legs and looking like a spaced out zombie. The young guy that replaced her was hiding behind mirrored sunglasses. He didn't move the whole time that he was ""on watch"" but jumped when his replacement showed up: I suspect he was sleeping the whole time. Yes it is a very boring job but why sign up for it if you don't want to do it. (There were about 10 kids under the age of 12 or so swimming at that time.)"
50,Staying at the Park GM was great because walking through the casino was very great without so much smoke. Staying at other places in Las Vegas there casino was very smokey. The Restaurants in the Park was great and we enjoyed the Janet Jackson concert was off the chains at the Park Theater.
40,We liked the new appeal overall now they have added more and more restaurants which would be amazing. He green tile and red tile in competing rooms was a very cool motif. You are close to plenty of things on that end of the strip. If you want luxury but budget friendly this is the way to go.
30,Great stay! The room was clean. I mentioned before that we had a handicap room I was really looking forward to the walk-in shower. The bar where I watched sports games was under construction hopefully it’s ready for football season.
50,Clean and comfortable rooms great pools (one is adult only fri-sun) lots of good food options. Easy to get around the grounds. Little Eataly was super fun feels like you're in another country. No mini fridge in the room but otherwise fantastic.
10,The MGM is not one I would recommend. I am extremely disappointed with the services received. I receive better services during international travels. Our room was cleaned two days later and towels were delivered 2 hours after requested. Not only did this take time out of our day but it was extremely exhausting dealing with the staff.
30,The room was not spectacular. Did not like the pictures on the wall. The table was old and scratched up. The shade did not work so we couldn't see the view . The bathroom was spectacular!! It definitely made the room stay ok
50,Had a blast. Loved the new rooms and the style of the hotel. The location was perfect  we walked to Aria and New York New York. We are part of the M Life Rewards so we gambled most of the night away at our hotel.
50,Super clean rooms and casino and in a great location. Easy walk to multiple things to do and see and multiple shops. They have great restaurants too. I will stay here again. It is in the center of it all without the chaos.
50,Check in was super easy. The rooms were clean and big. Shower had great pressure. Variety of restaurants were awesome. Hotel staff was friendly and courteous. Pool was great. Good variety of slots and table play.
10,Hotel was very poor. Room was dirty and the bed was hard. No coffee maker was provided along with no refrigerated. This is one of the worst hotel stay I have been too. The rooms are not sound proof. We can heard our next door talking.
20,I was expecting and looking forward to trying is the Park MGM but as soon as I got there I really didn't like it. The Hotel was kind of old and it look cheap. The what they so called VIP check in was really bad. Right away you feel like this is not a 5 star hotel. The front desk staff dose not even small or say hi to you. And they only 4 counter for check in. You can do a self check in with but with the self ck in you can't request for any upgrade. Then when you get to dinner at Eataly in the MGM Park OMG all the staff there are just very un friendly. It just dosen't feel like Vegas verb at all
40,I really like the location and the friendly and helpful hotel staff. My only problem is the constant increases of the resort fees. Eataly is great and lots of fun. Loved the Lady Gaga showroom. I also feel that the express comps can be a little looser. The rooms are simp!e but clean and very comfortable
20,Many more much nicer accommodations through MGM that is so much better than the Park MGM. move on. Maid service was hit and miss. Hallways dark. The AC set to freeze your butt off. No place to unpack your bag unless for an overnight stay. Lights flashing all night in the room due to Bluetooth connect and no way to turn it off.
40,Formerly the Monte Carlo Park MGM is ideally located for much of what you may want to do in Vegas. Notable value-adds: lots of choice for food & drink in Eataly; a decent happy hour in Primrose and hassle-free check-in and check-out. Note that if you book through Expedia your check-in code is not what the hotel has - which explains many issues people have expressed in their reviews. CALL the hotel in advance to ensure your check-in code is correct for smoother sailing.
50,Nice hotel with some pretty neat amenities. The food court or Italian watery area is cool. You can eat all sorts of delicacies and drink some good wine. I'd recommend staying here for foodies and wine coneseuirs.
50,A excellent hotel on the strip. Reasonably priced and staff is great. Housekeeping was quick to respond to our many request. On the Record night club has great music and good drinks but their entrance process needs work
40,I decided to stay here so that I would not have to worry about getting a ride back after the concert.  Check-in was a breeze. I checked in online. When I got to the hotel went to a kiosk to finish check in. Scanned the code that was emailed to me and my ID and thats all. The kiosk printed my key and i was on my way.    I like my room away from the elevator but good God the hallways are long. “Walking the green mile boss” where the first words out of my mouth. Got to the room and I was pleasantly surprised with the room (see pictures). The remodeled room was great nothing like it used to look like. The walls are not paper thin so i didn’t hear my neighbors and they didn’t hear me. The only con I have is the bed was too soft. I woke up every day with a pain in my neck or back. I was really happy with the number of outlets and usb slots for charging things.    The gym was a nice size and I would compare it to Planet Fitness with regards to the type of equipment. The pools were nicely maintained with plenty of seating and towels . I just wish there was an adult only pool to just lounge in without kids jumping in and out. Hint: the south pool would be great. The con is the drinks are expensive $20 for a 32oz cup of beer c’mon.    I really didn’t have any interactions with the staff so I cannot comment on it. My biggest complaint is the hotel does not promote/advertise the Eataly there. Unless you walk out the doors to the Strip you would never know it was there. I didn’t know it was there until my last night at the hotel. So maybe target those of us who do not gamble.    All in all it was a good stay. Worth the money and in the middle of everything. 4.5 stars
10,At the beginning the check in was 2 hours late. When I asked an employee they told me to wait. I therefore asked to get an upgrade with the room and she refused. My room did not have a fridge. I was forced to a cooler because my daughter needed cold milk. I was also under the impression we had free parking because I was told that when I booked the trip. When I got there they charged me $60 for the 4 days. Overall not a good experience and I will probably to use my total rewards card at Ceasars instead of my M life card.
40,Our arrival at the park MGM in Las Vegas was a pleasant experience. Although traffic was making it difficult to enter the property.Once we arrived we were treated as one would expect to be treated. The staff was proficient professional and pleasant to deal with. The parking facility was tall enough to accommodate my full size SUV easily.  The facility itself was very clean and there seemed to be enough staff to accommodate questions and directions.  The gaming was fine. It wasn't very busy midweek and I could find a spot at the blackjack table roulette wheel or the dice table.    The Room was nice and fairly decent in size. It was quiet too. Unfortunately I had a view of the arena across the street which had a Billboard lit up in neon until midnight. I suppose I could have drawn the curtains but I like to wake up to natural light. Not that big a deal but…  The location was ideal. Very easy to get around. Although slightly difficult to enter the property off of the boulevard
10,Uncomfortable beds. Unfriendly staff. Aggressive security personnel treated us like burglars. I had my family with me and I will not stay there again ever. Uncomfortable beds. Unfriendly staff. Aggressive security personnel treated us like burglars.
10,1st stay in vegas and not impressed took hours and room tochange get strip view i paid for.. room very grungy and dated.. bathroom was nice and freshly remodeled that was the only brightside to the whole stay. I was extremely disappointed at the cleanliness of the room... Felt like i took a time machine back to the 70's.
50,"Nice rooms with cute decor. Liked the long couch by the window. Beds were soo comfortable I didn't want to get up. Huge shower with super strong water pressure. 3 nice pools with plenty of FREE lounge chairs & FREE in-pool ledge lounger chairs (in 4"" water) which were great for tanning while staying cool at the same time. Bathroom/closet barn slider door is a bit awkward because it is the bathroom door & closet door. But it looks cool.  Great location -- a quick cut thru Eataly takes you to NY NY and all kinds of souvenir shops cheap places to eat across the street. Free tram will take you to Aria then to Bellagio to save on walking. Loved the quick & easy kiosk check-in & check out from tv. Check out Eataly an Italian marketplace inside Park MGM with restaurants bakeries shops... very nice! Starbucks on main floor gets very crowded in the morning but a quick walk will get you to Denny's across the street. I would definitely stay here again & hope to be back soon! Would like to check out LaLa Noodle next time. Daughter liked the Hello Kitty cafe truck across the street."
50,I really love the MGM Park property because of the staff friendliness and welcoming attitude. The room were clean and the beds were super comfy.Checkin and check out was super easy. Staff were helpful and friendly
40,We went to this hotel to see Janet Jackson. It's super nice! I was bombed a little that you couldn't smoke in the rooms but you can in the casino so its was a small adjustment. Overall beautiful! Staff is extremely helpful & nice!
30,Kioks didn't work and told a lobby full of people to wait for help that never came so everyone had to goto vip check in and wait on the 2 staff who were htere to check-in more than 100 people! One cashier was nice but considering they initially couldn't find our reservation that was an issue at 2am! IF YOU BOOK THROUGH A 3RD PARTY SITE CALL 1-2 DAYS PRIOR because they were going to charge us to stay because they initially couldn't find our res even though we had confirmation emails and even though it showed up in the MGM app.  At restaurants/bars book seating ahead of time. 1 place charged $100 to sit down! Most places won't give you water unless you ask - even Starbucks charged for a courtesy cup of water!
50,Great hotel very welcoming staff nice pool area with a bar the rooms was lovely it also told you flight schedules on the TV it had multiple plugs you'd have to had USB plugs for your phone the shower was beautiful
50,This trip my husband and I took along two of our sons ages 14 and 17 for a mini vacation. We usually travel to Vegas twice a year and while we always stay at MGM properties this was our first stay since Monte Carlo was transitioned to Park MGM. What a pleasant surprise! The rooms were clean with the most comfortable hotel beds we have slept on! The pillows were amazing and the blackout curtain worked GREAT! The noise level was minimal and we enjoyed our three days immensely. Thank you for a great experience we will definitely be returning to this property. Also if you enjoy Italian dining Eaterly is a MUST! The meat and cheese board is amazing and the wine selection is great.
30,The hotel check in process was good and while the room was okay it suffered from no place to unpack to- there were no shelves no bureau and I lived out of my suitcase for 4 days. The TV had a small ledge underneath and panels to hide the electronic connections. The last panel at the right did not lie flat against the wall and was the same in all 5 of my friends rooms. The cabana was nice but in air conditioned as in other hotels. The pool was nice and service was good.  The casino itself has many new restaurants and a new theater venue for concerts. The restaurants were very good and there is not a bad seat in the theater. I would recommend Bavette Steak House and Eataly as my favorites. Many great choices to be had. If they could fix the rooms to be more accommodating it would be a great thing.
30,Not much dining on property. No dresser in room and bathroom door can be a nuisance. Ask for extra towels. Bed was extremely soft which I loved. Not many table games (opened at any one time) Close to New York New York so great food there just a little inconvient.
50,This was my first stay at this hotel/casino. I was comped 3 nights reason for making reservations. The check in/check out process is strictly via kiosk there are agents ready to assist. We upgraded to a suite which for a few dollars more was totally worth it since we stayed 5 nights. The Eataly area for Italian food is great! The casino is very enjoyable easy walking distance to New York New York which also has a very nice casino.
30,"The hotel is average. The rooms are decent: a bit dusty when we arrived even though they claimed the air quality would be great. Not much they offer other than the ""air quality"" and mood lighting option. they didn't even have a small fridge. But overall service was great."
50,Great location on strip easy access to everything Free tram every 3 minutes excellent restaurants my fav LALA Noodles great rooms and staff. Only wish would be mini frig microwave in room and a little better AC.
50,I had a great time at the Park MGM and would gladly go again. Nightingale Suite was a wonderful place to sleep. Comfortable beds nice space and neat style. Everyone was very friendly and helpful.  Self check in was a bit awkward having not gone thru the process before but I'm sure it will be better next time.
30,No drawers to put clothes in. You literally live out of your suitcase. Loud music every night to put you to sleep unless you go to bed at 5 a.m. Location is one of the better amenities as well as the staff. The staff was very helpful with check in etc. When I was younger this would have been the place for me. Drop the overnight bag start drinking and go home in three or four days.
30,My husband and I stayed at the new MGM Park replacing the Monte Carlo. We were used to Aria and MGM Grand. Park does not hold up. The rooms are smaller ok for 1 person tight for 2. The bathroom had only 1 sink and was very small except for the shower which was great. A King room’s bed was set back in an alcove making it quite warm at night even with the AC on 60 degrees. The room was very new and stylish but cramped with a built in couch about 6 inches wide. Casino was great but could use more restaurants which didn’t cost 85.00 for 2 burgers at lunch. Dinner yes because we love a great dining experience and then a night at the tables.
20,Not for families.This hotel caters to young people who want to drink and party all night long. It is the old Monte Carlo which has been renovated and is now the park MGM. It’s a good location to go outside the hotel and do other things. The staff was rude when we asked directions at the concierge desk almost as if we were putting them out. The rap music was blaring early in the morning until late at night. We were told prior to booking our flight that we would be given a room upon our check in at about 6:30 AM. We sat in the lobby until after 12 o’clock only to be told that if we got a room it would be an upgrade and we had to pay an additional $40 per day. We finally got that room so my kids can get some sleep and our second room was not ready until after 3 o’clock. Although we had paid $40 extra per night for this sweet we were charged $16 a bottle for water that was in our room. My kids were in a separate room eight doors away from us because it was the only thing they had available for us to stay in. Their room did not have water or a mini bar at all. There was a rowdy group of women there who were at a convention who played their music at 6 AM and woke my boys up who had to call security as soon as security left they would turn it back up again and then were screaming at them through the walls about calling the security guards. The pools were small and super crowded and not catered to families at all. They look nothing like any of the pictures that they show on the website or from the travel guy that does reviews of hotels.  The only redeeming quality is that it is ashort walk to the aria or to the Bellagio which is where we spent most of our time. This is not a cheap hotel so we really feel like we were ripped off.  We would never stay at this hotel again or anything mid range like this.
30,As far as Las Vegas casinos go it was average. My king room with a view of the strip was cool. It was comfortable. Although in exchange for the view I did hear very loud music from the strip until about 2 AM. There are only a couple of restaurants to choose from onsight. Check-in was easy. First time I'd done done self check-in in LV but outside of my room not being ready the process was easy. The VIP counter helped take care of the problem with my room not being ready. Unfortunately none of the three times we waited by the Concierge desk was there ever actually a body behind it to help. Each time I ended up simply turning around and walking to the staff who assist at the check in stands for help. It is pretty conviently located next to Aria and on the little tram line that includes the Bellagio.
50,Hotel is in a great location m great check in system the rooms were nice but the ac didn't work too well but it was comfortable. I would stay again for right price. The staff was very attentive. The pools were nice and the service was fast
50,Great new renovated property. Great location to stores and restaurants on the strip. Enjoyed walking to NY NY and MGM Grand casino for all their different 24/7 restaurants. Staff was vet pleasant and helpful. Upgrade to a suite was very nice.
40,Nomad bar is awesome. Not a huge number of offerings at brunch but the steak and eggs was great. Very cool lounge type vibe with live jazz music. On the Record night club is very cool with multiple different sections to explore. Eatly is great! Fresh pasta meat and cheese boards and wine.
40,This was nice hotel but the casino experience was bad. I needed a refrigerator for medication and one was provided for free of charge. However the casino experience was not good. The slot machines were not paying even small amount.
40,The open dining area was fresh and had a variety of Italian based food and drink options that are reasonably priced. Rooms were clean and casino has all the games you would need. The only drawback is that some of the rooms don't have dressers to put clothes.
30,We stayed here because we were going to see Aerosmith.    Check in is at kiosks and is confusing. It looks like you go straight to the kiosk but you actually give the person at the podium your info and they take you to a kiosk but 1/2 of them were down creating more confusion. Once we got checked in we took our luggage to the room. The hallways are dark but the room was decent. There is a fabric sofa which is kinda gross since you are in Vegas and well you know.... we were tired from our travels and wanted to nap but our room was directly above the Nomad adult party pool in the afternoon. The music was loud but the bass from the music was terrible so we didn’t get much rest. Thankfully that pool closes at 6 and is only open Fri-Sun. The location of the hotel is decent and there is a free tram to the Aria and Bellagio and that was good. The pools are really nice and clean. We were there Saturday thru Tuesday and did not get our room cleaned once. Not one time! Thankfully we didn’t throw our towels on the floor so we could keep using them but we did run out of toilet paper.    I would stay there again but would probably try somewhere else first if I could.
50,Great property for eating gambling and swimming and lounging at one of the 3 pools on site. Eataly is amazing with plenty of great authentic Italian dishes to choose from. Excellent location and close to the tram to quickly take you other casinos on the strip.
20,Two sleepless nights… I was on the 18th floor and heard the club subwoofer pounding in my room till the early morning hours. Next the egregious rip off of regular items… I paid $4.75 for a regular bottle of soda in the convenience store in the hotel. Five dollars for a drip coffee… I don’t think so. I have a car so this is on top of the $52 charge for resort fees and parking. Next the hotel… Every single area… Is unconscionable loud. I guess you’re trying to be the hard rock… Newsflash there already is one of those. Even the elevator at 7 o’clock in the morning… Ridiculous. That’s just for starters. I will not be staying at this or any other MGM property again. FYI I was here for business and this is the third stay in an MGM property in as many months. I am requesting our travel department to not book MGM properties again. On a positive note… The rooms were nice enough and the staff did a fine job.
50,The hotel is very nicely remodeled from what used to be Montecarlo. Love the art!! Staff is amazing and very friendly! Primrose has amazing eggs Benedict!! The rooms are clean the beds are comfy and it’s a warm and inviting environment. What’s even better is how close you get to the center of the strip! And then you can jump into the tram from the hotel! It’s the second time I stay at Park and will continue to do so!
10,Horrible feng shui in the rooms. No clock in the rooms. All of our neighbors were loud and I’m a mother of two boys so I’m used to loud but you don’t expect noise from adults all hours of the night. For being open only a few months there quite a lot of stains on the carpet throughout the hallways leading to the rooms. Disappointing.
10,Bathroom were dirty the customer service was not existing expensive just to park no coffee maker in room no refrigerator in room ice maker not working on floor had to check in yourself over would not come back
10,I would never stay here again. The room had no refrigerator or dressers. The elevators and hallways were always hot and dark. Check-in sucked! VIP front desk were not friendly. Kiosks did not work. Again never will I stay here again.
30,The room was just ok some places were dirty and the very dirty window. The pools are small and the personnel there unfriendly. Plus the plastic cups were swimming in the pool no employee bothered to clean the pool from that mess. The employee at m rewards desk didn't helped me at all just as the employees at the check in were unprofessional and unhappy. Would probably not comeback again.
40,It was a good location but lacked a lot of perks that may be in other hotels. Not much entertain apart from the casino. Not many restaurants no buffet no club. Don't think there was room service. Missing room amenities such as: bathtub mini fridge coffee maker etc. Didn't speak to an actual human staff member the whole time as I did mobile check in and out.
30,My stay was great except you have to pay for resort fees and to self park. Bigger hotels like Wynn don't charge neither.    Other than that I have no complains. The location is great! A lot of eating places around it.    I would definitely comeback if not for resort fees.
50,The Park MGM was in a fantastic spot right on the strip close to heaps of restaurants and shopping.  The rooms were beautifully appointed and very clean. All of the staff at the hotel were extremely helpful and friendly.  The pools were great with multiple lifeguards on duty and even a massage therapist if you wanted to relax even more.  The hotel was connected to other hotels by way of a tram which was really convenient if you wanted to explore without having to brave the heat outside.  I would highly recommend staying here!
50,I stayed in the the Park MGM hotel in Las Vegas recently and it was very nice. I was able to get a good deal that included a food advance beverage credit. I was also able to see Janet Jackson concert at the Park Theater and it was great. I was good to walk downstairs to the concert and go back to the room without a big hassle.
50,Welcoming and helpful staff comfortable and awesome acoustics plenty of vendors all around a great experience! Aerosmith was awesome as well! Great location all around a wonderful experience. We will go back!
40,The MGM Park turned out to be a wonderful place to stay in Vegas. The rooms were large and decorated with homey amenities that makes you feel like you are in your own apartment! The room had a wall-length sofa with mismatched throw pillows random framed pictures on the walls and a table and chairs. Felt like home.  The T Mobile arena is right beside the hotel making it perfect for catching a hockey game!  The only things missing were a coffee maker and a fridge. Otherwise a wonderful experience.
20,We've have been long time MLife holders and we try and support all the MGM property's to we decided to give the The Park and chance. It was horrible from the get go check is in a complete mess with people fighting for different kiosks to check in limited to no support from the staff and it's very chaotic. After the check in it does get a little better. The rooms are nice spacious and nicely upgraded. The casino floor is nice with great ventilation and it is real close to TMobile Arena and ll the restaurants outside but check-in makes you crazy and sets a bad tone from the get go.
40,The Park MGM used to be the Monte Carlo but no remnants remain. It reminds me of a boutique hotel in NYC with cozy nooks dark colors natural themes and European style laid back photography on the walls. The place is huge but oddly envelopes you with a comfortable ambiance. Eataly - an Italian marketplace is amazing - full of coffees and rich meats and cheese and wines. Get a Lavazza coffee and sit and people watch. Best Friend is a great Korean BBQ place with a Mexican twist. Stop in Juniper and sample some of their gins. Park's location is convenient to New York New York MGM Grand Aria and has transit to the Bellagio. The rooms are a bit smaller than some hotels here but are trendy clean and very comfortable. Warm hues or greens and reds decorate the hallways and rooms. You really can't go wrong with this hotel.
20,Even though the room was clean there was only 2 very small drawers for clothes no coffee maker and no mini fridge no clock/alarm. When using the remote for the TV it was difficult to turn off the TV and to lower the volume. The blinds to open for a view out the window had to be fixed. We were disappointed that there weren't better choices for a quick snack. Eataly was nice but all Italian food and difficult for a quick bite. Starbucks was the only place to get coffee/tea in the morning which we do not care for. The music in the elevator was so loud that you couldn't hear each talking. The pools were nice and staff was helpful.
50,My first time in Vegas & for business. I didn't know what to expect but I was quite pleased with the room. The hotel is well located on the strip and loved the food market on casino level. The view from the room was ok.  I'll go back.
30,Nice room but no fridge or electric jug. Very disappointed as first thing in the morning you actually have to go down to lobby to access Starbucks or similar a coffee. The heat in Las Vegas has been around 40^ so to have no fridge in the room seems to be a bit ridiculous once again if you want a cold drink you have to go down to the lobby. Otherwise it is a central location
50,Newly refurbished with all new restaurants and casino. Eataly Italian marketplace is awesome. Two sit down restaurants within Eataly. The pizza is as close to Rome as I've found in the US. Rooms are small but very nice and great views. Service was very good.
30,I will start with the positive. The hotel is centrally located on the strip. The staff is friendly the rooms are clean. If you are just looking for a bed and no fru fru well here you are. An over priced bed. The inside is dark the rooms are dull no fridge no coffee maker  nothing and for the price you pay you'd think there would be more. So if all you need is a bed stay somewhere else. The dining options Meh. they have a steak house we did not eat there so I can not review it but I am guessing it was way over priced. They dont have a breakfast area at all. A starbucks that gets jammed pack with a long line by about 8 am. The food they offer is Italian bistro type. with very very limited choices. Even the pizza is not pizza it is more of a flatbread with toppings. Delicious mind you but over priced for what it is. I recommend going next door to the New york new york and the crepe place -to die for. They also had a buffet and several other options . The Casino was ok I am not a big gambler so I guess for being a casino it was fine. I stayed here to see Aerosmith the theater was nice the show amazing. If it weren't for the show I definitely would stay somewhere else. I think next time I am trying new york new york its just next door but more offerings at basically the same price.
30,Cons  - $37 daily resort fee  - $4 daily resort fee tax  - $15 daily parking fee  - $12 inner tube rental for their lazy river  - no fridge  - no microwave    Pros  - self check in kiosks  - self check out kiosks  - self print room key kiosks  - best friend (Korean fusion food)  - Haus of Gaga mini museum & merchandise store 😍😍😍  - Eataly (gelato fromager pizza Italian sodas)
50,Park has done done an excellent job with their upgrade. Loved our room. Well laid out and clean. Loved the bathroom. Casino floor is nice.  We come out to Vegas often and this will be our new “go to”. Very friendly.
50,Love staying here. Newly decorated rooms. great food and atmosphere. Conviently located. Staff is very friendly. Great players club. Fun Fun Fun Will stay here many more times. Highly Recommended AAA++++
30,Smokey casino ventilation not good. Stayed four nights and housekeeping kept servicing us as if it was one person either 1 washcloth or no mat for floor. The shower doors did not keep water from floor. No-alarm clock; table and one chair I front of a long window sofa. SmallTwo draw nightstand in the closet. So two adults with 2-4 bags to share a small two draw nightstand tucked away in closet. I’ve had better amenities and room at a Choice property.
10,First time in Las Vegas and very underwhelming it’s a shame was looking forward to being greeted and suggested where to go out etc    Person to greet you to check in would have been a plus instead of machines
40,We stayed here for 4 nights over the July 4th weekend. We were very excited to stay here as we had visited this casino before and found it to be lovely. The room was nice but was missing a place to put our clothing. We lived out of suitcases for 5 days. It made the experience some what uncomfortable. The room was modern and the beds were comfortable. There was no refrigerator. I feel like Park MGM could have done better.
40,Pros:    - modern clean room with comfortable beds  - Eataly was delicious and is a cool idea! I'd love to see other cuisines (Chinese French etc) done this way  - Pool was great to relax and hang out by  - Excellent maintenance service when our AC was broken engineer was to our room and had it fixed within a half hour!  - I personally like and prefer the self check-in    Cons:    - poolside service was erratic at best and nonexistent at worst server would come by once an hour to take a drink/food order. It's not like we didn't tip and they didn't appear overly busy! Ended up just going to the bar for most drinks (bar staff were excellent!)
40,Overall nice property and nice atmosphere. Need more ventilation for smoke and the rooms should be fully stock with common amenities such as ironing boards. My family said they will not return to this hotel.
10,I did not like the fact that there was no refrigerator in room or even oce bucket. I dont feel that we should have to go to casino for a cold drink. Would like to enjoy stat in room without havimg to leave room for outrageous price of drinks in casino.
30,Overall The experience was OK. Keep in mind if you have a casino host they are only willing to do the bare minimum when it comes to additional freeplay services etc.... I normally stay at Mirage and the service they provide goes above and beyond what is expected. Recommend stay elsewhere and maybe walk-through just to check out park mgm.
10,We could hear everything in the rooms around us. And our neighbors were pretty quiet. We could hear them open their blinds heard their phone alarm talking sneezing and every door that closed in the corridor all night. Did not sleep at all. Not a fan of the self check in either. Interesting but I prefer a person.
30,Hotel is nice for the price staff friendly but not enough staff present when you need help at the self check-in. No staff present at concierge desk In the evening. Rooms are clean and the location is convenient.
10,The Park MGM is one of the worst hotels I have stayed in. The room was dirty with dust on the headboard and next to the bed. Dirty foot prints in the shower and bathroom. The room had just the basics to call it a hotel room. The tv had less than the basic channels you get with over the air tv. Very disappointed with this hotel!
40,Since eating at Primrose and seeing the Park MGM lobby I’ve wanted to stay. Valet was good ($24/day though) and bellhop friendly and efficient. I liked checking in at the kiosk and having room cards printed. It was easy and quick with plenty of kiosk availability and standby employees to assist. Accessing your floor is easy with different elevators for sets of floors. I liked how simple it was to navigate the hotel. The carpet in the room was worn and dirty. Beds were very comfortable and we liked the shower. The two queen room felt small and didn’t have much counter/table space to put belongings but makes up for it with a sofa that runs the entire width of the room. We heard many noises from the room next door so some soundproofing upgrades would be nice. Air duct in bathroom was incredibly dirty. The 3 pools were pretty crowded Friday 3-5pm but there was ample seating. It was nice to experience but not my favorite Vegas hotel in this price range.
50,Clean hotel. Great staff. The pool was amazing user friendly  Las Vegas is ready for you. Bring alot of money ... Las Vegas is family oriented .the shows are the most interesting things to see in Vegas
50,My Paparazzi Convention #one life stay was great. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Will come back to Las Vegas and hopefully will stay again hopefully next time will stay longer. The bed was very comfortable.
50,I will always consider Park MGM for any future trips to Vegas. The hospitality and marketing/entertainment staff was exceptional. My stay at the Park exceeded my expectations greatly!!!! Until next time Vegas
50,I enjoyed staying at the hotel. The location is not too bad but I prefer if it’s closed to the center of Strip Street. I’ll come next time for sure whenever I can. Finally I prefer if you add Poker Tables because it’s my favorite game.
40,We stayed in a room with 2 queen beds and a view of the strip.    Pro's:  Easy to navigate (not huge like some other casinos)  Comfy beds  Excellent location  Nice strip view  Plenty of available chairs available at any time at the pool (unlike other casinos)  Easy check in and out  If you choose to check out late (like 6pm instead of 11am like we did) you have to pay a fee but you do not have to pay the resort fee for that day    Con's:  Paper thin walls easy to hear neighbors' convoes  No refrigerator in room  Pools are kind of small. Wish they kept lazy river.
10,The automated teller and unexpected fees makes impossible to get a real sense of how much your hotel room actually costs. I booked my room through Expedia and I was lead to believe that was the final cost.    When I checked out I was surprised by the extra fees that I was being charged for. I looked around for someone to talk with and there was no one. I was standing in front of a computer and it is hard to have a conversation with a machine.    I would highly recommend you go to another hotel that will have a human check you in and out that way if you have any concerns there will be someone to help you out.    MGM has set it up so the personal interaction is gone. If you stay at MGM good luck trying to resolve any billing questions with a machine.    Just my 2 cents from a frustated customer.
20,OK. Nothing special. Needs improvement. Sparse room with no amenities. The mattress was lousy and the sheets were not changed nightly. Always wear dark and creepy and a friend found a bug in their room.
20,"Had to move 3 times due to unclean rooms. Finally settled in a room that was ok and was told I had to change rooms the following day again because it had to be ""serviced"". Customer service at the VIP counter tried to help the best they could but their management was not responsive at all and did not support their team! Not the ordeal I was wanting to go through while in Vegas for a trade show/work."
50,Cute Hotel in an overall good location. 24hour Eataly was charming and had the best cannoli 's . Staff was kind and helpful. Rooms were clean and pleasant. The 3 pools are nice but little smaller then expected and the rooms do need a fridge.
10,After leaving my iPad at the bar and tracking it back to the security office I was told my security multiple times over two days that they did not have it. After getting the manager involved it miraculously showed up but then I was told I couldn't have it back until I filled out and signed some forms. I couldn't have MY PROPERTY back. Its some kind of scam...
50,Convenient for us going to the Janet Jackson concert. Clean rooms and friendly staff and great location. The casino did not smell like a smoke farm. Great atmosphere for family dining. Cool place to stay.
40,The rooms were quiet and cutely decorated did not appreciate 15dollar parking daily and resort fees an extra expense but overall nice. Many restaraunts near by and nice walkway across the street. People were friendly
50,Very current fresh and exciting hotel experience. Love Eatly!!!! The staff is very courteous and helpful especially to first timers. The dollar value for room was comparable. My advice will be to pack what you need $16 for a 2pk razor or cigarettes is kind of ridiculous.
50,Clean simple rooms. Nicely done. Not stuffy but easy and simple. Staff friendly. Good size casino. Need more beverage staff or bars open during the day center bar gets a little boring. Spa was fabulous! Had a great massage with Kim.
50,Experienced great resort ! Check-in was easy and fast. Room was perfect with a very spacious restroom. Halls were roomy and dimmed lights help set the tone to restful night sleep. Overall exceptional resort!
40,Nice and cleana bit outdatedbut comfortable.Was hoping for a simple food selectionsnot the fancy choices alone.The pools were  shallowstanding only.Buffet choice would be nice.The hallways could  use a face lift.
10,Casino has VERY limited table games. Rooms are cramped and not well designed. Room service is delivered in a sack filled with paper cartons and plastic ware. Felt like a convience store with really bad food. Manager on duty was rude. Never go back
20,Only good thing was the pool. Rooms have no fridge or microwaves. hallways are very dark sad and gloomy. very limited choice of food to eat within the Park. Had to call room housekeeping to change sheets due to cleanliness.
50,Park MGM perfect size if you want a casino but don’t want to get lost. Only complaint was housekeeping knocking at 9am on our last day. It’s vegas so we stayed up until 5 planned on getting up around 11 since we had late checkout and to be woken up by a loud knock scared me because I thought we overslept. It startled me and I could relax but the hotel was great overall. Not letting a small negative ruin my trip to Vegas. The location is great less than 10 minutes from your room (walking) and you’re on the strip fantastic
40,LOCATION: Center of the strip. Whether you want to see Cirque du Soleil go clubbing or indulge in one of the best buffets in the world Park MGM is close to it all. Not many hotels can pride themselves of being directly in the center of all the hustle and bustle that makes Las Vegas so unique.  EAT: Park MGM has Eataly. Enough said. Eataly is probably one of my favorite places to eat when traveling to big cities because we are just such a huge fan of fresh steamed fish with a olive oil and a dash of lemon. That proscuitto bread and cheese is seriously all you need for a wonderful meal. Additionally Bavette steakhouse in Park MGM is definitely a must visit. You can call or email the Park MGM concierge to make reservations beforehand. The steak here is top notch and there's even a smaller cocktail lounge in the back that's open when there are afterparties from performances  DRINK: Drink at the Juniper bar if you like strong cocktails or if you want to stop by for a drink that is #instaworthy. Their cocktails are beautiful and the composition is spectacular. We love to drink lots of specialty cocktails so it was a huge plus for us to have a good cocktail lounge so easily accessible.  ROOMS: Don't expect the best resort rooms. It's remodeled inside but you can still tell that the decor and room layouts have carried over from Monte Carlo. The rooms are either painted ALL RED or ALL GREEN. The beds are still very comfortable so that's a huge plus.
20,The design for the rooms is terrible with ugly random artwork and oiled brass fixtures with visible cords. You cannot lock the bathroom door as it's a barn door that allows access to *either* the closet or the bathroom. There aren't any drawers. They disabled the TV's ability to receive streaming from a phone. There isn't a vent/fan in the bathroom. They hide the water fountains. Also the cell service is awful for at least three different carriers (Verizon T-Mobile AT&T).
20,This is the old Monte Carlo or they spent some money on trying to fix the hotel and branding is an MGM property. I guess they figured people would think it’s a higher end hotel than it is. Their check in procedure I believe is one of the worst on the strip. Won’t be coming back.
50,Loved the hotel & casino! Very nice & has an awesome location to eat “Eatly”. 10/10 recommend. They have great rates and it is on a perfect location to walk and see the rest of the strip. Checking in was soooo easy they have iPad stations to make it fast for everyone!
50,The location of the hotel is great. With the T Mobile out the door. The pool access via elevators are great. The casino was no huge easy to navigate.    Spend hours in Eatly from the cafepizza pasta bars. Great plave to eat and shop
30,Same as before curtain didn't work. I called the front desk to move rooms they said they didn't have any. An engineer was supposed to come fix it was never fixed during my 2 night stay. I had to stick my fingers up there to rotate to close it which was slightly painful but I need to sleep. It was too bright without a curtain from the light up billboards outside my room.
40,This place was pretty cool. I loved Eatly that was probably my favorite thing about the hotel... I ate there every day! Their prime rib panini is to die for. Beware of ordering pizza because they can’t extra cheese on it cause they don’t have a button so I pretty much felt like I ate bread with pizza sauce and a small piece of mozzarella. The rooms are kinda small but have a neat design.
40,Good place to stay while in Vegas.. good location.. the machine is not so good it’s my first time spending $400 on one machine without me getting a bonus spin .......4.5 stars for service and location
50,Decided to come to Vegas for long weekend (sat to tues). Stayed in standard king room which was slightly small but definitely adequate. Main problems with room is that the door to the bathroom is a sliding door so not much privacy and it shares the common door to the closet so you can not open the bathroom door without closing the closet and vice versa.    Casino was great and not too smokey. Eataly was very convenient and the food was good albeit slightly overpriced. Also the las vegas strip exit was conveniently close to an ABC store so you can get all your sundries(alcohol) easily and cheaply.    We ate at Bavettes which was really good. We shared a steak (22 oz dry aged bone-in-ribeye) which had great flavor. It was expensive at $91 but since we shared it it wasn't too bad.    Another great thing about the hotel was the fact that you could walk to Aria and Bellagio without really going outside (you have to take a free tram for Bellagio).
40,Perfect spot with great access to all the hotels and the strip. Nicely renovated since it was the Monte Carlo Hotel. MGM has done a good job. However I was not informed that the night club's music (open roof on the first floor) could be heard on the 26th floor until 3:00 am. Really ruined one day on my convention. I needed sleep. Would have been nice to know by staff that a room on the strip side would experience this issue. It appears they gave me a food credit (thanks) but I would have rather had sleep before a big meeting and lecture.
40,Had a great stay at Park MGM to see the Janet Jackson concert. This hotel is convienently located to the venue Park Theater is located inside the Park MGM and to other hotels on the strip. I especially love the tram that takes you from the Park MGM all the way to the Bellagio.
20,No front desk help (could not get an upgrade cause there was no one to talk to) our room did not have dresser drawers (had to live out of our suitcase and put the clothes on the floor) no fridge or microwave no food court for cheap eats. They have Eatly which is like a food court but EVERYTHING is Italian based pricey and you just can't have that everyday.
20,No fridge in the room at the Park MGM. Big problem as husband and I drink gallons of chilled water a day. Hotel is more mellow than other Vegas hotels but still a zoo. There's a nice free tram that goes from Park MGM to the Bellagio. The French garden bistro is good for Breakfast at MGM Park. We ate brunch in Mon Ami Gabi and watched the Bellagio fountains. Saw the canals at the Venetian. We came away from Vegas as a playground for adults. Only lost a little money playing slots. All in all worth a visit if only for the proximity to Hoover dam. Boulder City closest town to the dam is an interesting little town with a flea market at its center. Worth a wander through.
10,The online description of the King strip view room is so misleading. The room is so small ugly red curtains and bath tile no closet! I called room service for a corkscrew and 2 wine glasses. I was told the corkscrew and glasses were $2.00 each and there would be a $4.50 service charge. Ridiculous those items should be standard in a guest room.
40,Comfy beds and great customer service. The shower is amazing! One night our room wasn't cleaned but they send someone to clean it right away. They also took one night resort fee off our bill. We were very happy at first but the front desk did what they could to make us happy.
40,only stayed here one night for the Janet Jackson show. Made it very easy to get to the concert. Huge plus!! Usually stay at the Cosmopolitan the Wynn or the Encore. Sort of felt like I was in a cheap motel that recently got overhauled with a million dollar renovation. the bathroom was nice and modern but no ventilation. and be honest it wasn't very clean. The room was okay but the furniture felt old like they went to an old hotel that was getting rid of all their furniture. Loved the view of the NoMad pool party I usually have a view of the strip but this was a refreshing change. Nice touch having those heavy duty black out curtains greatly appreciated those!! LOL Finally it was very hard to keep the room cool. The vent is near the window in the corner which you can only feel if you were sitting near the window. All in all if I had to see another show at the Park MGM theatre I may stay here again. Although it was much more expensive than i usually pay at the Wynn.....so
40,What hotel does not come without a refrigerator. I'd like to purchase water outside the hotel or anything that needs to be refrigerated without being force to buy a cold expensive drink in the hotel!!!
20,I will never book at this hotel again. Checking in is a nightmare you have to use kiosks and do it all over again even after using the app. The gentleman who was supposed to be helping with check in was extremely rude. The room was never cleaned even though the do not disturb sign was never put up.
50,Park MGM was wonderful. Everyone I encountered was friendly helpful and professional from the assistants at check-in and check-out to the guys at the taxi stand to anyone I asked for directions. All areas were clean and well maintained. Checking in and out was a breeze.
10,Room was not available when we requested & paid for an early check-in. We waited 2 hours in the lobby for housekeeping to finish getting our room ready. We encountered 4 other parties that had the same issue.
20,"Although reasonably priced they rid of a ""front desk"" and replaced with machines there was no one to contact in the middle of the night when we had severe issues with the room next door AC worked very poorly and Vegas is extremely hot during the summer months! We waited to check bags in at the bell desk. Three people were behind the desk literally doing nothing (two sitting one standing leaning against the wall they were just talking to each other nothing urgent). We stood there staring at them until someone else came to take our bags. At the Primrose Restaurant we experienced the same laziness with the host staff while waiting for a table in a half empty restaurant."
40,It is a pleasant stay and the location is central to everything but it isn't the most kid friendly and there was no sports book. But all-in-all a good place to stay and play. Just take the kids across the street to New York New York.
40,Clean not smoky friendly staff. Eataly is a fantastic food experience. Casino room temperature is nice and cool. Staff is friendly and helpful. Easy walk to other casinos and big parking garage. Spacious rooms.
40,The hotel was easy to check in great customer service. We mainly stayed here because we saw Janet Jackson and it was convenient. I would stay here again if I watch another concert at this hotel. I just hope they can add mini refrigerators in the rooms.
40,Nice rooms just not enough storage if you are sharing a room and/or staying multiple days. Staff was very friendly and kind I did not encounter any issues during this stay. Location is conveniently close to shopping and entertainment. Right on the STRIP!
50,Great place! The Park is centrally located with easy access to the New York/New York and other casinos. I specially liked having the theater within the hotel. For elderly customers this is a plus. The variety of slot machines is adequate. The carpet and hard flooring is well maintained.
50,First time to Park MGM since they completed it. Sports book was not available...this is my biggest complaint. Walking to other properties to place wagers was an option though so that's what we did...just not very convenient. Room was nice enough. Solid shower. Don't opt for the strip view room because its essentially the same as the non-strip view rooms. Do yourself a favor and go to Bavette's (steakhouse inside Park MGM). Best steak I've had in Vegas so far and I've been to almost all of them.
50,We stayed here to see the Janet Jackson concert! It was very convenient for that reason not to mention great food bars and centrally located. The service was great great pool area also! I will stay here again.
50,Great my family had a marvelous time. Service was Amazing. Love the location. Ours rooms were great as well. Would definitely recommend to others. Looking forward to our next visit. Housekeeping services were Excellent!
50,I would recommend this hotel from front desk to wait staff exceptional My girl friends and I came in for our birthdays to see Janet Jackson ans she was freaking amazing if you have never seen her you gotta go the best place we found to was LaLA Noodles in the Park MGM.
10,Horrible experience at the casino.  Faria is a liar! Don’t play at her table.  She told her supervisor that we put our hands inside the table and stopped the dices. Freaking liar! Dices jumped out of the table hitting my boyfriend!
50,This hotel was close to everything - amazing food - and pool area - plus On The Record - Speakeasy!!!! It was an ideal situation - and affordable/non-stop fun!!!! The concert venue and ease/quality of the venue were excellent - plus - it was Janet!
30,The sports book was closed upon arrival with no prior notice. The no line check in was great until the digital key did not work the second time. When returning to lobby for a key card the staff suggested I would have better luck trying the pool for fun. I tried it and it was not closed and I was able to get in with my key. It was nice so something did work out! Oh and Eataly was great.
20,Service was not the best. AC not working in my room during a summer visit. Took 48 hours for someone to show up to fix. Check in - had to check in 3 different times - each time I did I was told to come back later for keys. Came back later for keys and was told I wasn’t checked in yet. This happened 3 times. Check out - need to make a change to my billing info - no one to be found. Aggravating needless to say
30,We have stayed here before and this last visit everything was just avg. Had some issues at check-in which took forever to resolve. Sportsbook has been under construction for at least 1 year or more. The only saving grace is the location to everything
30,I did not enjoy my stay at the Park MGM. The rooms were average. I requested a strip view because it was my 50th Birthday. I was so disappointed when I opened the blinds because it was a strip view of the air conditioner and garage.
50,First time visiting the Park MGM. Had great time and hotel was over all very good. Try Park MGM when. You visit LV next time. I wish there was more choice of restaurant. Try Eataly restaurants. You will feel you are in little town of Italy.
50,This was my first stay since the remodel and name change of the former Monté Carlo hotel and casino. It’s an amazing MGM property with impressive amenities including the new venue called “Eataly “ a not miss everything Italiano adventure. The “Stay Well” room accommodation provides a total relaxation experience.
40,I have stayed at this hotel several times in the past year because of good value. I stay in spite of a hopelessly convoluted check-in process. I am eligible for VIP check in but it was providing very slow service. Automated kiosks are my next choice and I find them cumbersome to the point assistance is required. Good news is assistance is available but many guests need assistance.  NoMad restaurant is very good and good value.  Casino staff is very friendly quick with beverage service and good cashier service.  Maid service is excellent although room was a bit small.
50,First time staying here as Park MGM. Been here when it was Monte Carlo. It is much nicer modern and staff super friendly. Their mobile check in procedure was way easier than any other we have used this helped since our flight came in delayed and we had little time between our hotel arrival and time we had to leave for a show.
30,Casino small  No Buffets options for food was limited to PrimroseEatatly  Nothing open to eat late  Would like to see signs that direct you to which side of strip you are on to make it easier to know which door to go out of.
50,Overall good stay at this hotel. Park Wieen room was nice but small for me wife and two teenage daughters. I attempted to upgrade to suite but no availability during my stay. Also attempted to extend for one night but rates were to expensive.
30,Went to Vegas to see Janet Jackson. We stayed at the Park MGM more for convenience since the concert was there so I’m giving 3 stars for location only!! We stayed here several times years ago when it was still the Monte Carlo and it was nice. First off check in is a nightmare. My husband checked in online and was supposed to get a text when the room was ready but he never got a text so we had to go to the lobby but there’s no direction about where to go as it’s a kiosk system. I went to the concierge and was told to stand in line at the VIP desk!?! and that took forever because they only had two people at the counter and they were having computer issues but we eventually got our room. Now for the room... Whoever designed the rooms needs to be fired! They’re horrible.. dark and depressing. I guess they were going for a minimalist/industrial look but it doesn’t work at all. There is a gross table and a very uncomfortable chair just plopped down in the middle of the room and a window seat/couch. the dresser drawers are in the closet and they have these stupid metal panels under the tv that I thought could be used for extra counter space or a desk but they’re just there to hide the wires from the tv. The bathroom was ok and the shower was good. I just can’t get over the decor. I do not recommend staying here.
20,This MGM property is not for people that wish relaxation/spa and good food! The restaurant options are limited and not welcoming. After attending a concert at the PARK Theater (around 10:30pm) the one restaurant (LaLa Noodles) would not seat more than a few folks because they were closing. The Eataly - interesting multi-vendor food mall - was also closing and staff where packing up. Even the onsite Starbucks was closed! We had to leave the Park MGM/Nomad property to find something to eat.
20,The common areas like the lobby casino and restaurants are quite nice. We were surprised and disappointed for a renovated hotel that our room as spartan as it was: not drawers to put our clothes away no shelf to place our sundries in the bathroom two old stained leather chairs and felt like a budget hotel room. There were minimal hotel staff: called front desk multiple times but no one answered and self check in was rather impersonal. Feel like part of MGM cost cutting measures.    Gym was outstanding-one of the best on the strip. Starbucks is gorgeous. Eataly is beautiful but a bit pricey.
50,I have always stayed at MGM Grand or Newyork. This hotel is very intimate love the layout and location. This use to be the Monte Carlo.The pool area is Beautiful. The food is amazing  Clean Beautiful rooms everyone treated me and my family professionally
50,We had a great stay at the Park MGM! We loved Eataly the pools and the great location. The room was perfect for us! Great views of the Strip and very nice and spacious. The staff was very kind professional and helpful.
40,I found this Propery was a great value. Gaming tables could be more varied but overall it was a good experience all around. The VIP checking was a bit understaffed but it wasn’t a deal breaker. I felt there should have been more choices when it came to restaurants but New York New York was close enough that it didn’t become a huge problem.
50,Great time had by all. The only negative was the incidental hold went from $50 to $100 a night. I could have used the extra money to gamble. Now that we've left its back in my pocket. My gain. Their loss.
50,The location is great next to T-Mobile Arena great shopping and dining. The room is great choose the Staywell floors in the Hotel. They have true blackout drapes nice furnishing and quiet floors. The view was awesome.
40,Second time I've been here and it did not disappoint  very close to everything on the strip. Room was clean and tidy. Food at the hotel is very overpriced but if you go next door to New York you get some better deals for your money plus you can use any food and beverage credit you have at other mgm resort hotels which is a bonus. Bus stop right out side the hotel and a couple minutes walk to the shop to stock up of water.
40,"Have you ever had the idea to go to Las Vegas and have some fun? Well I think that the Park MGM Hotel can be a good place to stay really inside Las Vegas ! In a few words: big large wide hotel good rooms (possibility of family arrangements like 2 + 2 beds) standard room service and cleaning nice reception people . But what we really did appreciate was the breakfast buffet : following suitable indications and walking at least 15 minutes starting from the reception we reached a restaurant indicated by a huge placard ""BUFFET"". Well we had the possibility to choose among the largest variety of foods and fruits we have ever seen in an Hotel ! and last but not least  you can reach in the same way the FREE elevated monorail transportation mean to reach the other famous theme hotels (Bellagio Venetian the ""Tour Eiffel""  …). It should also go without saying that along your pathway you can see any kind of gambles and machines . And you can have a room with a view on the nearby ARENA if you wish so !"
40,Great location to stay if you’re going to see a show casino is very nice  pools are great with ample staff and very friendly. Many great performers are lined up to appear in the upcoming months and I don’t think there is a bad seat in the house
50,My family booked 2 rooms (kingdouble) which were awesome! The remodel was a great investment. Eataly has so many choices on food and desserts which are all great. I would highly recommend staying at the hotel. Staff was excellent.
50,Love the Park MGM... beautiful rooms especially luv the Eatly it's like an Italian gourmet cafeteria. Also the location is right next to the Luxor Aria MGM and Cosmo... so no taxis needed and you can take a tram to Aria or Cosmo & Bellagio.
10,Terrible hotel. Check-in is only through kiosks that don’t work and is a fiasco. If there is a problem they send you to a 50 person long customer service line with 1 person working. Rebranding appeared to be a few new pictures on the wall- otherwise rooms are musty dark and disgusting. We checked our luggage while this room was getting ready and they tried to give us someone else’s computer and luggage when we went to pick it up. Only redeeming quality is the Eataly attached to the property.
50,Park MGM LAS VEGAS  overall it was just a outstanding trip great people in lobby really nice rooms  outstanding food perfect place to stay First time at the Park MGM and it’s definitely not my last.
40,Park MGM provides a pretty good experience but could work in the customer service to make it great! The self service experience was lacking and really left a bad taste in our mouth and the concierge could use some additional training. However Crystal at the spa the DJ and the drinks at juniper lounge the nicely decorated and comfortable room and Janet Jackson’s concert made the experience better.
50,Park MGM continues to be the most affordable convenient and best staffed resort on the strip. Customer service was exceptional! The casino was clean and easy to navigate. The pools were fabulous and not over crowded. Park MGM offers a multitude of dining experiences. Primrose invites you to dine inside or out by the pool while featuring an abundance of well prepared food items.  The addition of the Eatery was everything you could imagine you would find in Italy.  After 14 years of staying at this resort I am still impressed by the quality of the resort. Can't wait to return next year :)
20,No hotel maps no microwave coffee maker or mini fridge in the room. Only benefit if this hotel is that it was the location of the Janet Jackson concert. Staff was friendly. Would not recommend this hotel couldn't cool the room adequately.
30,Phone in he room was not working and never fix I was told that I as going to be fix but it was no fix and cannot call for bell services had to use my cell phone to bring my luggage to my room because the
50,Very good hotel will definitely stay again friendly staff good rooms the room service was good as well just wish the pool would stay open up a little later than 8 o clock but besides that everything was great love this place
30,Next time for my vacation I will choose wisely because I was caught off guard on extra deposit but oh well at least I get the $400.00 back I really need it Lol 😂 we had strip view maids was lazy didn’t make the beds I was very disappointed ☹️
50,I enjoyed the Park. The close proximity of the hotel to strip restaurants and shopping is a definite plus. I enjoyed the efficiency of check-in and the plentiful staff that were stationed throughout to guide me through the property and with every question I had. Came specifically for a concert and the theatre on the premises was exception. Can’t wait to return!
40,Short trip but enjoyed time away - Hotel check -in check -out was a bit of challenge no time convenient to use pool closed down at 8 pm- $200 deposit up front that was not aware of. Only had time to see small portion of hotel/resort??
40,This was a two day trip with my 14 year old. I didn’t plan on gambling and I prefer a more relaxing Vegas experience so we opted for this property at the recommendation of my hair stylist.    It’s less like a resort and more like a luxury apartment complex.    A more sophisticated clientele than surrounding properties. Ask for a room away from families with children/groups. Our section seemed less busy. First night was very quiet. Second night lots of loud talking in room next door and door slamming. Rooms not very sound proof.    Decor is simple and contemporary. Not ideal for families with small children.    Restaurant selections are primarily upscale. Best Friend is a cool LA type experience. Eataly is chaotic. Get a glass of wine there and take to your room. Better selection and price than room service.    Location is great. Free tram to Aria and Belagio. New York New York is right across the park. Better food selection especially for families. Casino seemed to have looser slots.    The pool area is away from rooms so more private than hotels where they are visible from lobby or walkways. In that regard more resort like. The only drawback of pool was they blasted horrible music. I prefer not to have music playing at a hotel pool. Very annoying.    Service was standard. Nothin g special. The most helpful staff were the valets.    There is no front desk!!!! It’s all self check in. So be prepared.    Here are the two things that were major negatives for me.    1) No coffee makers in rooms. This means the line at the lobby Starbucks is very long and it’s expensive. Only one small restaurant serves breakfast.    2) Restaurant selection: great good just all upscale.
30,Strip view room not as advertised in pictures. Hotel used to be the Monte Carlo and you can tell. Rooms a dated. Not worth the money for a strip view when you actually look at the casino roof. The staff was nice. Check in was a little confusing.
20,This hotel lacked customer service and when you did find someone they were less than friendly. There was minimal shops and the ones that were there closed early and opened late. There are no attractions except the casino. The park theater was open but there was only one show that played and was not really what we were looking for. The hotel advertised a lot of restaurants but all but one was closed for the 5 days we were there. Primrose was open but not that kid friendly in their menu selection. There were no attractions in this hotel like almost every other hotel in Vegas. I would go to Vegas again but not here.
40,Let me start off by saying we used a two complimentary room reward from myVEGAS. We thought checking in would be easy but be cautious that they don’t charge you more than they should. Thankfully Luis in the lobby was more than helpful in getting us the appropriate price. SOMEONE GIVE THAT MAN A RAISE. Poor guy had to deal with my emotional female self and for that I’m eternally grateful to you Luis.  Although I was helped by a nice employee I still have to gripe a bit about fully automated check-ins. Sure its trendy and the screens are big and shiny but there’s something nice about being helped by a person. Also we were here to celebrate a big birthday and even if we had been refused we could have at least had the chance to ask for an upgrade or at least get some sort of amenity had we a living breathing person checking us in. Oh well the kiosks are quite pretty after all.  Our view was great facing the T-Mobile Arena gave us a great screen to just stare out at while we laid down on the absolutely comfortable king bed. Guys the beds are the perfect combination of firm yet soft. Both my boyfriend and I woke up feeling more refreshed energized and lacking in our usual back pains.  The sliding bathroom doors are strange because they don’t really lock?? I realized the clicking sound I was experiencing was my pushing the door too far into its track not locking it like I thought I was! But damn those showers feel comfortable and simple. Could have used bigger shelves to put my stuff inside the shower but the space and water pressure more than made up for it. I remember reading a review online somewhere that the bathroom’s ventilation isn’t the best and while that’s true it’s not like you’re still left with a steamy bathroom 30 minutes after your shower so it’s not a big deal.  The room service pamphlet had a shoe print on it so that was gross but I still ordered room service off of it hahaha. Primrose is a pricey place but the ham and cheese omelet with fingerlings was the perfect dish when you wake up after your typical Vegas night and 6 am bedtime.  A big con: the walls are thin. Not only did we hear the shower next door and the sounds of our neighbors opening up their shades we also heard the small moans of a woman having a good time so families be ready to turn that TV on at full blast! This really bummed me out cause not only is that something I don’t want to hear I also want to be able to speak and have our boisterous friends over without ruining a neighbor’s sleep or lounge time. This leads me to say that the Park MGM is a pretty quiet hotel. My floor was so dead quiet that just closing the door sounded like the loudest thing in the world. Nothing bad about that but also kinda strange to someone naturally loud like me.  The casino is basic but I liked it; slots tables electronic tables all the good stuff.  Eataly was on our list of places to eat at but instead of going at the prime time we wanted we ended up trying their leftover prosciutto sandwiches around 1 am by the lovely and friendly employee there. She toasted up the sandwiches and we ate a delicious flaky buttery and crispy creation. I wish I could speak for the rest of their food but unfortunately we were too tired to present ourselves and face what I assumed would have been overwhelming crowds.  If you have the money and are interested go to Best Friend the super cool restaurant by Roy Choi. We are very familiar with Choi’s style having frequented Kogi in Whittier many times. It’s definitely pricey (it’s Vegas though so that’s kind of a given) but pretty affordable compared to others. Kimchi Fried Rice and Eggplant Schnitzel are life-changers you can thank me later.  Parking is $15 a day which is very stupid and kind of greedy unless you’re a VIP and live everyday of your life in a freaking casino in which case you’re good.  All in all Park MGM is a pretty good hotel located in a cool little area of its own off the strip. Some things are a little annoying like the thin walls and
10,I’m so shocked at MGM for the room and experience. Don’t stay at Park MGM if you are planning on staying for several days. You don’t have anywhere to store your belongings. The dresser is a nightstand not a true dresser. Please let the CEO of MGM know that not everyone that comes to Vegas is staying for a day. Some people travel with their families and kids stay for several nights and should be told that the room doesn’t have enough storage space for more than 1 person. Shame on you MGM. Went to VIP that day and the young lady manager was of no help at all. She wasn’t trying to accommodate me and my familly. I’m assuming she felt it was my fault because her solution was to charge me for another room. To give us 2 rooms without dressers. I politely walked away from her and didn’t accept her offer. I thought I would wait until another manager was on duty to share my unfortunate event with.    Walked to VIP to voice my concerns with someone the next mort. I met a manager he was from Chicago specifically the Beverley area of Chicago. He listened to me and did his best to try and accommodate us. However getting a new room was more stress. I was told that I would be moved to a new room with storage space and someone would be in touch around 1pm for that move. Nope didn’t happen. I missed going with family waiting around to move at 1pm. Well 1pm turned to 4pm without a call. I decided to give the front desk a call after several hang ups someone finally told me the new room was ready. Again shame on you MGM!!!!!!!    On another note I’m a registered nurse part of a group of nurses who travel a lot together. We come to Vegas at least 3 times a year for shows. We stay several days at a time and usually stay at MGM resorts. Our group will be glad to know they won’t have to live out of their luggage bags by making the mistake of staying at Park MGM. I hope that’s enough space in the nightstand for a family of 4. Shame on you MGM!!!! MGM resorts formerly my fav!!!
20,I hope that Scott at the casino bar is not what the management at Park MGM allows or thinks is acceptable behavior. He humiliated me and my husband and was completely disrespectful. Scott was not friendly and he felt it was acceptable to act in such an unprofessional manner.
40,Hotel was good but not the High Scale experience expectation especially with the Kiosk checking in exerience. Only staff I interacted was with the VIP Desk staff. Rooms at other high scale hotels are much better.
10,From check in to check out customer service was lacking. There are no drawers bellhops take over 30 minutes to show up so plan accordingly. Also called front desk for extras we never received. no fridge
50,Would like to come back ... maybe the end of august.. theirs a couple of shows we would like to see  we Hope to see some hockey this year too ... Go Knights... Who is your to go to hockey team... maybe some football next year
50,Had a blast staying and gambling here. Right sized casino and very comfortable. Craps crews are extremely friendly. my nighthawk suite was clean and the perfect size. Park's location couldnt be better with a great view of T-Mobile Arena
50,Loved our short stay at the new Park MGM. The service from the moment we arrived was very good. Our room wasn't ready yet so we were offered a free upgrade which really made my day after a long drive. I will be staying again when we visit in October. Thanks again Park MGM.
40,Went to check out the new park MGM after all the renovations the place looks nice there is a few things that I didn't really like.  When you walk in to the park MGM from the strip you walk into Little Italy lots of little restaurants and tables for people to sit and enjoy a nice meal and a nice glass of wine the only problem is when people are coming in off the strip they have to literally walk through the tables while people are trying to enjoy their meal there's no place for people to walk where you're not disturbing people. In regards to the rooms I felt they could have spent a little more money on furniture rather than artwork on the walls you literally have five hangers and a little tiny nightstand to put your clothes in and if you're a couple and you're going for 5 days like we did we had a few close so if you wanted to hang out your close good luck.  The pools was very nice I like now you can bring your own non-alcoholic beverages in as I am a Coke classic drinker and they only sell Pepsi so I like to bring my own pop in years ago you they never allowed that but now you can. They now have quick check ins and quick checkouts.  Service was always great and you can't complain about the gambling lots of it.  Had an amazing trip.
50,This hotel is wonderfully renovated. The location is great and has many new food options with Eatly and Best Friends and Lala Noodle. The rooms are a great size and both the king and queen options are well laid out. The bathrooms are very well lit and feature a spacious shower but no bathtub. The hotel is next to the T Mobile arena and has the Park MGM arena in the lobby so entertainment is no problem to find. The casino is a nice size. There is no buffet on site but it isn't that far of a walk over to the Aria buffet which is AMAZING! It's not that far of a ride over from the airport and the check in process is great as well. I look forward to our next trip to the hotel. The pool deck is well laid out and also recently renovated.
40,This is a great hotel. The staff is great. The lobby shops and stores are fabulous. Check in is painless. The food in this hotel in wonderful. Transportation is great from hotel. The pool is to die for.
20,"Whatever the refit cost it wasn't worth it.    Firstly the room: Maybe they're going for a minimalist vibe but my impression was that they had just gotten bored halfway through stuck all the picture on one wall left the furniture wherever the removal guys dumped it and took out everything else except the bed. Seriously - there wasn't even a towel rail in the bathroom. See the attached picture of the central lamp with bare wire running from the outlet to the middle of the room. The outlets and switches? They didn't even bother changing them - same as when I stayed in 2016.    Also missing: do not disturb sign; hotel directory; minibar; notepad; pen.    Secondly the pool area is now terrible. honestly. Where there used to be a fun lazy river and wave pool there are now three identical rectangular pools. Whoever thought this was an improvement was very badly mistaken.    Thirdly no more buffet affordable dining or personality on the casino floor. The only saving grace were the guys at the bar (Clyde? Cliff? Sorry man you got me super drunk but you have a fantastic goatee) who were funny nice keen and very generous with their pours. They even made a drink on the spot for my wife who wanted all the effects of vodka but none of the taste. The bartenders are worth an extra star that's why you're getting ""poor"" instead of ""terrible"".    Really guys whoever did your revamp and whoever it was that approved it was cheating you. The location may be great but that's it."
50,I stayed at the MGM Park for a few nights and I was pleased with the service and also all the newly renovated rooms and casino. This hotel is centralized on the strip. You will be pleased if you stay here. Only down side I found was that the room I stayed in had no mini fridge but that was not a major disappointment for me. The shower was amazing and very spacious. You will enjoy.
50,Such an awesome place to stay. Was recommended by friends and very happy with the decision! Definitely recommended to friends and will most definitely book back here for future trips in Las Vegas for whatever reason it maybe be for.
20,The air conditioner in our room was not working properly. We finally set it at 62 and it cooled down a bit. The air was also not working in the common areas on each floor and near the elevators. It was nice to not have to walk through the casino to get to the pool or out to the strip. Rooms had nice decor but beds where very uncomfortable. Bathrooms are on the big size.
30,Location is great! Across from ABC store and Walgreens = reasonable prices! The pool was great fitness center has nice machines! The beds and pillows are comfortable!However no fridge or coffee in the room or anywhere ice machine on our floor was broken the entire stay the room doesn’t have any place to organize clothes the AC didn’t feel that cold. Mgm park was less crowded than others and not as smoky and we liked that.
30,New coat of paint and retiled bathrooms but with older furniture... Nice looking NoMad restaurant and bar but food was mediocre at best and service was awfully lacking. Great central location close to everything.
40,The property sits a few steps off the strip. Great access to tmobile arena and several restaurants. Disclose the resorts fees upon making reservations and overall Park MGM is a great one property to stay. I really enjoyed myself. Look forward to having me again.
40,This is an automated check in hotel no need to interact with staff unless the machines give you trouble (they very well might). Make sure to stay on higher floors as some of the lower rooms don't get any sun and face walls. Overall clean & good access to the strip and restaurants.
50,Such a nice beautiful place that still has that new-car smell. Remarkable food court great restaurants fun casino great pools.  We went for a concert at their theater - Starcrawler Spoon Cage the Elephant & Beck - and used that excuse to stay in their new hotel and casino. Just a great experience all around!
40,Wife and I were here for 2 nights over the weekend.    We checked in online and received a QR code in a few hours. Our flight was delayed and we didn't end up checking in until 4am. The check in process was super easy and simple. All we really did was picking up our keys.    Our room faced T-Mobile arena and NYNY. It had ample space for everything we need. Bathroom amenities were great. Bed was comfortable. The room was clean. I had no major complaints. I wish the safe was bigger and the closet door separate from the bathroom door. It got really annoying moving the door around sometimes. I did not test out the Wi-Fi since we don't really need it.    The conversion around the hotel from Monte Carlo was great from the park area all the way to Eataly. Although Eataly was overpriced for what it is I am glad Lavazza was there for our coffee needs.    I still do not like how Vegas charged for everything like the useless resort fee late checkout fee and tipping everywhere. But overall this was one of the better hotels amongst the evils. We will be back.
20,Check in process is via kiosks.  Requested connecting rooms or rooms to be close but did not get them and staff was not friendly or helpful in resolving.  Room rate was good.  Eately was nice.  Location was good.  Rooms were fine - nothing special.
50,The service was great. The only issue I had is paying $15 fee for parking each night . But the rooms were clean and the service excellent. If you want to take a break with the walking... Take the aria express tram. It drops you off at the aria and at Bellagio. Free!! 😘
50,Pleasure stay and very cozy and comfortable room. The casino was nice and the surrounding areas and stores were a plus. The bed was very comfortable and the room was very spacious. We enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay again.
20,Mobile Service not function correctly and tried to fix it w/ staffs not working after still.  Room Service sucks since next door was loud for talking and slam the door at 3:30am ~ 5:00am tried to call staffs to resolve issue and no one respond it.
40,Our experience at the Park MGM was very positive. The hotel is nicely decorated and clean. The staff is friendly. It is very walkable and has other close options nearby for exploring. We would stay again.
50,Park MGM is fabulous. I'd like to stay in this hotel over and over again. The rooms are quite spacious bathrooms are modern bed is extremely comfortable. Also location of the hotel is very convenient.
10,The room terribleit was so small NO dresser small closet with five hangers small bathroom. there was no where to put your belonging in the room. The TV did'nt work. The Ice machine on our floor didnt work and we were told to go to s different floor for ice!!..  We asked for Upgrade-and we were told we would get a call. Never got a call we had called the next day and were told it would be an additional 150.00 charge for a Sunday!We are Gold Members and an upgrade is not suppose to 150.00 .  We have stayed at all MGM resort las Vegas and Most the Harrahs resorts.. This was the worse experience we ever had  Also we wanted to see the fight saturday and the Sport Book was be remodeled!! we where not notified prior to booking the Room
50,Had a blast at park mgm.. I was there with a friend for the fight and had a great weekend and experience in everything we did. Very comfy beds and fun hotel to stay at. I will be back soon and usually stay at mgm properties.
30,Room I reserved was not available- assigned a room with non working phone. Checking in was devoid of human contact all automated. Given fifth floor room. After doing some sightseeing -return to room for a quick nap before the evening events started unfortunately the pool party DJ kept the music pumping and thumping-no rest for the weary!! The music sounded like it was the floor right below us.Won’t be staying here again
50,The park MGM hotel had a really nice casino pool area eating area (Eataly) and general location on the strip. The view from our room was very nice. The room itself was nice but nothing exceptional. I would definitely recommend this hotel to someone looking for a place to stay in Vegas.
10,While being in a great location this facility lacks many common amenities. I tried calling the desk at 11PM for service and was placed on indefinite hold. My toiletries were never refilled. The air conditioned made noise all night long. Overall a major disappointment.
50,I always stay at The Park MGM mostly because it has some of the best dining options on the strip. Now with the opening of “On the Record” it now has the holder club too ! After Lodi g a phone and a wallet on the property and having the staff turn into a virtual Sherlock Holmes investigative team the items were found within a few short hours and completely saved our weekend. We all know how miserable it is losing your precious electronic devices and the staff at The Park wouldn’t rest until our goods were recovered. Thank you Steve and all the Excellent staff at The Park. I’ll see you in August for football season t looking forward to that brand new spirts book !!!  Mark M
20,To start paying for parking even though I was a guest was lame. Eataly is super confusing. Then had loud club music getting to the room so I couldn’t sleep. I thought they would do better. Pool was nice but crowded
50,Park MGM is a great hotel and casino. Convenient to all the big venues. The restaurants were great and delicious. The three pools was awesome it didn't feel overcrowded. Definitely I will be staying there again.

50,The hotel was fabulous service great and pool was excellent. The only drawback was not having reasonable price restaurants on the premises. I.e. Buffet or burger . Otherwise you had to go outside to the park or other venues within the Mlife to enjoy a breakfast buffet..
50,We visited the Park MGM for my birthday weekend and had a fantastic experience! The room was petite but not cramped or uncomfortable. Very clean and comfortable space. We LOVED the convenience of the central location and were so excited that Eataly was in the hotel! We'll definitely be going back!
30,we got to our hotel room late Thursday. Friday morning we realized that the lock on the door was not working and anyone could walk right in without a key. We went to the bell desk and the lady could not have cared less and was very rude. We then went to the VIP desk and the lady there handled the situation immediately with concern. The lady at the bell desk upset me very much. what if someone had drunkenly stumbled in our room! Other than that I liked the location of the hotel a CVS was right next dooer
20,Terrible service for checking in and out. I booked over 9 rooms...paid with my credit card but staff insisted my guests put the entire stay on their personal credit card before they could checkin. Many calls assuring it was taken care of...but NO...it all happened again on checkout. What a mess at the front desk. AC sucked in my Nighthawk Suite also. Engineer??? No resolve...no offer to be moved either.
30,Room was not ready at check in room was not was given in info of room being a wellness room it was just a regular room casino was very small park theatre seating was horrible had a cords and curtain blocking my view it was a recovery time from chemo after two months of dealing with cancer. I check out early just to get out of that place.
50,Great new look spacious gaming area friendly staff. I like what I seeeasy access to the strip you can shop until drop no matter what your price range is. Fun and gaming for all levels of guests. Party on only in Vegas baby...
50,Stayed here for a week for vacation and had a wonderful time. Did have an issue at check in that the staff took care of immediately. The hotel was clean and quiet with many things to do on site. Also located on the strip near the action. Will definitely be staying again.
30,The room didn’t have a dresser and the closet wasn’t very big so that was an inconvenience. The shower drain didn’t work properly so the bathroom floor was constantly wet and the carpet got wet too. The neighbors were loud pretty late our first night but that’s not the hotel’s fault. Enjoyed the spa and proximity to Eataly that part of the strip and T-Mobile but if I’m not going for a specific event nearby I’ll probably stick to other MGM hotels more reliable than this one in the future.
20,Overall I would not recommend this hotel or request it for future trips I have into LV. Even the questions asked on this review are redundant. And now I’m just filling space so it will let me submit.
50,Great place to stay. Good games friendly dealers comfortable room and great reward program. Food selection is very good. When playing games the servers are coming around quite frequently to ask if you would like a cocktail.
50,Great place to stay and dine. Only negative thing was kack of table games and lack of tables open. Staff very friendly and helpful. Restaurants were great with a lot of variety. Location is also great as you are in the middle of strip.
50,The old Monte Carlo--MGM really did a good job of revitalizing this place.. Very clean and rooms easy to get to I go to Vegas 5 times a year--first time ever stayed at Park MGM. I already re-booked for September. Very nice pools (3--1 of them adults only)
30,The rooms were about as we'd expected however the check in process was terrible. We were greeted by no one and after seeking help (at a desk with no less than 5 employees just standing there) was told the only way to check in was on a tablet. It wasn't super complicated but I wanted a chance to upgrade my room and maybe discuss things going on etc. NOPE go deal with the tablet. This fact alone is why I won't return to this property. The property itself was good. The rooms were mediocre but Eataly was amazing!
30,Had a couple of issues when we checked in. Our two rooms were booked to be connected. When we checked in they told us they could no longer accommodate that and our rooms were placed 12 floors apart. The first room we checked in had a very strong sewage smell which they got us moved very quickly. The second room A/C didn't work but we were only there for 3 days so we dealt with it as we didn't want to seem like a bother.    Rooms were dated for being a recent renovation. Overall it was just very blah. Won't stay here again but it wasn't the worst hotel experience you could have.
40,hotel had 3 small pools hot tub very shady pool area one pool was for adults only which was nice. hotel itself was clean and smelled amazing when you were near the food area. nice location on the strip.
50,Thelma was the best dealer at Park MGM we played single deck blackjack for hours. She made the game fun welcomed new people and explained to new people how to play. It was truly one of my favorite blackjack experiences in Vegas.
20,A nice hotel but a resort fee that is a complete ripoff.  I dont see myself returning to this hotel unless I get some comped rooms of MyVegas.  The casino has changed but not for the better. The roulette wheel now has 3 green zeros and blackjack pays 6/5 no longer 3/2.
50,Clean modern and very nice! The bed was very comfortable and loved the huge shower. Self check in and check out made it a breeze. As for the location you can’t beat it! We will be returning for our next Las Vegas vacation!
30,It’s an older hotel that used to be the Monte Carlo but still feels like a pretty old hotel.the only reason I stayed at location cause it’s in the middle of everything. They may have changed the name and appearance a little but still feels like an older hotel.
30,Over all the rooms were pretty nice. However getting a nice room took a minute. We checked in at the kiosk which is nice and quick. The computer did give us keys to a room that had not been cleaned. When we entered our original room the iron was in the middle of the room and there were about 10 unopened water bottles and a can of Sprite waiting for us on the table. We were going to ignore this as the bed looked freshly made. The last straw was when we went into the bathroom there were wet towels still hanging. When we called the front desk they weren't apologetic and told us there were no other rooms available we would have to wait for housekeeping. Once we got to the lobby the staff was very helpful in getting us a different room. Dont get me wrong the start sucked but the beds are very comfy. The staff were all nice. The security near the elevators were funny. I liked the park mgm. I hope it was a 1 time mistakes. I would probably consider staying there again.
30,Overall a nice new hotel no sports book at the time and the shower was magnificent.  The mobile check in did not work. A serious bummer.  The mobile key and hard keys would not work together either you had to use only the mobile key or only the hard keys. Not either at the same time.
20,"comp rooms were the smallest I have ever seen in LV. The closets are larger at Cesar's that the entire room. The bed was about 7"" off the floor. No coffee makers? WTF? The Treasurer must own stock in Starbucks! The gaming was cold cold cold. Make sure to get a confirmation (in writing) if they waive the resort fees. I was shafted on this round and the fees have increased to almost $50 a day. Greed is still good on the strip!!!"
50,Erika's birthday trip to Las Vegas with the hubby at the Casinos expense. We had a great time which I cannot go into detail about. Somethings are not to be shared. This resort is in an EXCELLENT location for everything.
50,Great service!!! Valet pool dealers !!! Excelente service !! Thank you so much !! Ok I even lost my wallet at the pool and the security handed back to me I had so much fun!!! Is very clean and very well organized!!
30,"The hotel is rather nice. There was an issue on my first night with the cleanliness of my room. When reported to front desk staff they really didnt show much concern. The room was large and pretty nice. Had a slight view of the strip. The club ""On the Record"" located inside the hotel was very nice. Valet was not so pleasant. Other than it was not too bad of a stay."
40,So glad they redid this hotel. Casino is still a bit small for my taste but the rooms are spacious and nice. Hallways still warm with old a.c. it seems. But overall it's my new home in Vegas. No more bellagio
30,Good price and location room wreaked of smoke. Noisy nieghboors could hear through walls. Hotel responded quickly when they woke me up. Prices are not overkill casino was a little higher on the buy ins if you're trying to relax after a day of working.
30,No staff to check you in used kiosk. However if you want to know where room/ elevator is who do you ask? Hallways carpet to room was very worn out. The Room was average at best. Location was decent.
40,We attended the Aerosmith concert so it was so convenient to stay in the hotel that the concert was being held at. The staff at the hotel was friendly and helpful. We would stay in the hotel again. The rooms were clean and quiet.
30,Although newly renovated and has a new name they definitely skimped out when renovating the rooms. The closet has a couple drawers and just a few hangers so if you are here for longer than a weekend or have more than 2 people in your room this may be problematic. The amenities are just minimal one drinking glass no refrigerator no coffee maker no expensive drinks or snacks in the room for easy access. I do like the bench seating area by the window although it’s not that comfortable. Not a fan of the green decor but I guess it matches with their colors throughout.    I do like the mobile check in option although checking in with the kiosk doesn’t seem efficient between people who don’t use this option since you need to stand in line along with them. Need a separate line or set of kiosks for mobile check in guests.    Location is the big plus for the hotel. It is located in the heart of the strip across MGM Grand next to New York New York walking distance to the new Park area outside T Mobile arena. So even if you don’t want to eat and drink at the hotel there are so many other choices just outside. There’s also a CVS and Walgreens within walking distance.    There are a lot of food choices in the hotel/casino with my favorite bring Eataly which is like a fancy food court with the focus of Italian specialties.    Pool area has three different pools and although doesn’t seem big there are lots of lounge chairs. Love the lounge chairs that are actually located in the pool so you can get the best of both worlds with getting your tan in and staying cool in the pool.    Casino is very small and they don’t have a sport book.
30,We are on a road trip from SoCal to Montana and our first stop was Las Vegas for one night. We chose the Park MGM because it now has the wonderful food emporium called Eataly. The hotel is very mediocre. The check in was at a kiosk which is impersonal but may end up being more efficient when it is busy. I don’t like not being greeted by a front desk staff and making sure that I am getting the right type of room. Our room was on the third floor. The hallway ceilings are low the lighting is dim and the guest room feels like an inexpensive motel room. We are glad we stayed at the hotel only because we love eating at Eataly wherever they are located and found it convenient. I would say that the room is pretty depressing and am surprised that they charge so much for so little.
50,Enjoyed our stay great location. Clean rooms. Great value. Staff friendly. Easy to find parking. Starbucks keep the line moving considering the morning rush of guests. Will definitely be staying again.
30,This was our second stay at the newly remodeled Park MGM. The rooms are very nice. Nice decor good ameneties. Comfortable room. But we had issues with the cleaning staff (didn't clean our room one night) and some other personnel who in my opinion didn't do their jobs in regards to keeping kids moving in the casino.
50,We really enjoyed our stay at Park MGM. Rooms were very clean pools were enjoyable and the dining options are awesome. The casino was well laid out but the check-in feature was exceptional. We have literally waited hours at other locations just checking in.
50,The employees at the hotel are extremely kind. It has a great location. We had an amazing vacation there. They offer great service and will tend to any problem. Nonetheless the hotel rooms are very spacious and comfortable.
20,Although I had visit the hotel as it first opening and there was not much going on there. A year later this was my first visit and nothing much has changed. The hotel needs a more diverse restaurant selection. Seems as though every restaurant was Italian. Get more food options. Tacos couldn't hurt. The casino Bars Lounges and clubs was dead. The hotel was still dead as it was a year ago.
20,This is the old Monte Carlo re-imagined a bit. Good location on the strip excellent new restaurant in La Noodle an interesting dining experience in Eataly a good mix of games (probably one of the smaller gaming floors but overall decent use of space) and polite staff. Room does not have a clock no real room service (you can order from one restaurant that will deliver to your room but not the normal room service menu) and no buffet. But overall a good comfortable stay and definitely one of the more reasonably priced for that location on the strip. Unfortunately they put nearly $1400 in authorizations against my credit card ultimately putting an actual charge through of over $1000 on a final hotel bill of $55. They put through enough authorizations to get one of them rejected which also caused them to shut down my ability to bill to the room costing me several hundred dollars in room credits I had not yet used. If incorrect billing is not a concern for you decent hotel for the value.
10,1st room still had fecal matter on the toilet. 2nd room the sink didn't drain and the towels were still soiled from a previous guest. Housekeeping stopped by our room and asked if we needed anything we requested fresh towels but they never delivered them.
50,Great place Amazing Vacation customer service was thru the roof I had a blast and it was the best place I have ever stayed in Vegas I will definitely be back food was awesome Dealers and pit bosses really made it a good time if you gamble
50,Wow what a blast. The boys screwed up here and there and totally laughed at themselves. Non stop entertainment. Don't know how they have that much energy. Awesome concert. High energy. Great show. Well worth seeing.
20,The pool area was very disappointing for a family stay. There were also no selections for dining. Monte Carlo was much better than the Park MGM now because it has more dining experiences and also offered more shops.
10,Terrible hotel went to check in at 11 at night  they said the rooms was not ready really ??  the rooms that were booked were not available so  they gave us totally different room  save your self time and stress  forget about this hotel
50,Having stayed here previously when it was the Monte Carlo i was excited walking into the newly renovated Park MGM. The hotel and casino was very clean and well laid out. We stayed in a Suite which was a perfect size for the 3 of us and had a great view of the strip. Our dining experience was Great! With both Bavette's and Eataly it was just what we needed. We saw a show at the Park Theatre onsite (Aerosmith!!) and it was amazing! Intimate venue with not a bad seat in the house. Pool was awesome as well make sure you get a Frose! All in all would stay here again and again!
10,The automated check in didn't work. Had to wait 20 minutes in the VIP check in which is not VIP. Only 2 eating placed. No where to get a quick bite at a cafe. No room service. One step up from Motel 6
30,We’ve stayed here before when it was Monte Carlo personally preferred the old styling but over all a nice hotel offering a lot more choice for food & drink.    Seemingly over priced tables & you won’t find any blackjack under 8 decks.
40,Great customer service super clean hotel rooms and property. The renovation turned out really nice especially the market area. The only thing that kept me from giving the Park a 5/5 was all the technical issues I experienced during my stay. Mobile check in worked fine but keyless entry via the app intermittently failed and I got locked out of my room. Security was nice enough to run a key card up. All kiosks we’re down during check out so I got stuck in a long line at the desk. Several of the machines failed to except rewards card and after playing for several hours never received any points. Regardless pros far outweighed the Cons and I’ll be back for sure.
50,"My husband and I flew out from Florida to attend Aerosmith's Deuces Are Wild Tour at the Park Theater. Our 3 night stay was very enjoyable. The Park is directly on the strip and surrounded by so many things to do. It also has Eataly is an indoor ""little Italy"" with shops unique eateries and what seems like a million wines available for purchase. Since it was July and over 100 degrees we opted to stay within the confines of the hotel and found plenty to do in those 3 days. We look forward to returning some other time. The Theater is a really great venue because there's not a bad seat in the house. The concert was amazing!"
50,I have stayed there for the last 15 years it is a great hotel.the are great and the gaming floor is just the right size. The food is great and the prices are good. Can’ t think of another hotel I would wanted to stay at.
40,Very nice rooms very helpful staff and great promo pricing!!!! Loved the view of the room especially enjoyed the location of Park MGM close to everything was able to see the stadium being build for the Las Vegas Raider 2020 season
50,Large rooms. Super clean. Uber comfortable beds! Excellent service. Great location - we walked across the adjoining park and visited the NY NY many times to eat. Shake Shack Pizza stand Broadway Burger Bar Tom's Urban and America (twice). Valet is FAST.    Starbucks just off the lobby. Good sized casino area. Eataly is super fun - and a great place to grab something sweet.
50,Loved this hotel. Great benefits when you enroll in M Life program! So convenient to everything. Quality hotel with lots to offer. Usually stay at the Aria but this will be our new hotel when we travel because of affordability and the same level of comfort and service as the Aria.
10,From the moment you check in on kiosks that don't work to expecting towels from housekeeping to basic drink service while donating your money to the casino.. there wasn't a whole lot of positives about this hotel. This was the first and last time I will stay there.
50,Loved the friendliness of the staff the hotel layout casino and pool. Loved the new Eataly and it smelled delicious when you walked through. Loved the showers in the rooms which also had great shower heads with excellent water pressure. The beds were amazing and I slept like a baby every night. The only downfall that I can think of is the pools. Although I like the layouts I think they should designate one pool for families. All three pools had children at them. I'm not one to say to keep your kids home; it's just that when I am there with only adults I don't want to feel like I am at a water park. The lifeguard was constantly blowing her whistle at them. Overall our stay was perfect and we will be coming back again soon.
30,Found the propert nice check in sterile- no personal interaction!rooms a bit outdated no place to put away clothes need small refrigerator somewhat dreary pools very nice loved Eatly food area!
20,I was not impressed at all. They claim it as renovated but you couldn't tell. It looks old and outdated. The rooms are bare basic with no dressers refrigerators or microwaves. Nothing special at all.
30,I recently visited the property for the first time and from the moment you walk in the staff seems unfriendly and not interested in helping you. The pool bar staff the bell desk staff and check in staff were all just there for a job and not the make guest feel welcome. I would have had a better time at the MGM Grand or Cosmo. The rooms and the restaurants are clean and fresh and the casino is clean. I dont like to see closed stores and restaurants and this was common during my stay. It was a good value but don't expect exceptional service.
50,The Park theater is great. If you have the opportunity to see any shows there I would highly recommend. Aerosmith was awesome! All seats in the theater seem very good. I would suggest arriving early. Drinks are not cheap but there are 16oz options that are reasonable for Las Vegas.
50,I got the cheapest room at Park MGM and still had a room with a good view. You will enjoy the re-do of this hotel. Everything new. I thought Park MGM stopped free drinks in the casino but I was able to get drinks playing slots.
40,The mini suite really was mini and it looked old the bed was low to the floor even the furniture seemed out dated however the bed was comfortable the shower head threw water out in a fierce way. But it was a quiet floor so all went worked out
50,The former Monte Carlo where we have stayed many times over the past decade is now the Park MGM and Nomad hotels. Fascinating to see the extensive changes that were made over a couple years while keeping the facility in operation. Rooms are very updated stylish and modern as is most of the resort. The new Italian food market Eatally is a lot of fun and has wonderful food.
30,"Just bad customer service. Employees there dont care. I had trouble almost at every turn and not once did a staff member help. It was more of a ""sucks to be you"" type attitude. Check in guy didnt even say a word to us not even a hello. Just pressed some buttons and walked away. Get up to room and its 2 queens instead of the 1 king bed we reserved. Look at bill to make sure its right an extra $300 incidentals fee charged. We got it back upon checkout but damn maybe say something to the guest before u give me a heart attack. Room seemed only half cleaned. So it was just one thing after another. Anyway got more of the same thru the whole stay."
20,Hotel is utilizing technology that is not implemented correctly for check-in/check-out. Their 'front desk' phone help takes 30 minutes to get anyone on the phone. The walls are paper thin and I am a heavy sleeper who was woken up 2/3 nights from people in the rooms next door. The food is overpriced for small portions. It's not the worst option on the strip but it needs some work before I would ever consider staying here again.
50,My wife and I came down and was comped rooms for the 4th of July weekend and we decided to stay an extra couple nights. This place went above and beyond to make sure we had a great stay. I was given a casino host I was escorted around as if I had my own security team and to be given a chance to Meet UFC champ Jon Jones free of charge was an added plus. Downside out of the whole trip was the fees. Parking fee and resort fees were ridiculous. Other than that Park MGM was awesome Sauce.
10,I have stayed here twice. Once at Nomad. First stay they started installing vents for eatily.... at 7am. Staff did not move me or compensate me when I complained. ALSO did not mention or notify me there would be construction noise. Second time at Park took 2 hours to get into our room (at 5pm) room was dirty still. Staff member came into room TWICE to check stock on fridge. Bed linen was stained couch was stained. Will not be back.
50,Loved the Park MGM Las Vegas. The rooms were clean the staff were friendly and helpful and the blackjack dealers were fabulous. I was happy that they made playing more fun and they were all very friendly. I was also happy that the casino did not smell like smoke.
40,Rooms are recently renovated. I stayed in a suite that had significant more space than the regular rooms if its more than one person I would definitely do the upgrade if the price is right. Casino is medium sized Eataly is nice but doesn't stay open late enough for the strip. Check-in is ok for a kiosk system. There wasn't a line when I got there but if there was I could see it being a big issue because I saw lots of folks having trouble with the ID scan.
40,I was attending a conference at the MGM Grand but unfortunately missed the room block for the conference so I decided to book at the Park MGM. Definitely an affordable room great location and very friendly staff. Walls are a bit thin in the rooms so you can hear your neighbors at time but wasn't anything bad. I would strongly recommend this location if you are visiting Vegas and don't want to pay an arm and leg at the mega casino/resorts.
40,Stayed here for two nights during my most recent Vegas trip. Check-in at the kiosk was quick and painless. My room was on the 4th floor. I like the wall mirror with the LED bulbs. Room was clean and it provides what I need during my solo trips. Visited the Eataly section since that was still under construction from the last time I stayed here. Very nice and the food smelled delicious every time I walked through there. Won a little bit of money on the slots and used my $50 resort credit for a meal at the Money Line Sports deli. I ordered a bacon cheeseburger buffalo wings waffle fries and a Fiji bottle water for about $45. Other than that I spent most of my time out of the hotel playing at the WSOP at the Rio. On my next visit I will try to check out the On The Record night club they have on the first floor. It seemed like it was a hot spot on the Friday night I walked by there.
50,Will make Park MGM my new favorite Las Vegas destination stay! I really enjoyed the classy look of the hotel. All the staff was friendly and helpful. Rooms are very clean and well maintaned have everything you need.
20,Hotel looks great. They didn't have the type of room we had booked and comped our resort fee after downgrading our room (fine I guess). Staff was friendly. We enjoyed the hotel's pools and restaurants and the location is great.    This is hands down the least soundproofed hotel I have stayed in in my life. I would compare it to two tents in a campsite where you can hear every adjustment or tent zip - you can hear your neighbors adjusting their blinds unzipping their suitcases or going to the bathroom (yes unfortunately) as clearly as if it were happening in your own room.    I am a very heavy sleeper so while it was a little weird hearing every single thing my neighbors said and did I didn't lose any sleep. If you do not sleep like a corpse as I do please reconsider booking this hotel. We chose this hotel because we liked the location and amenities but we will definitely not be returning.
30,This is the old Monte Carlo property and it feels like that... very strange room (even though I did upgrade to a Strip View King) which had a very slight view of the strip TV and Internet service were hit and miss for several hours there is basically no closet space and a sliding door covers the bathroom and I guess what they would call the closet. On the positive side it had the quietest AC ever and room noise from other guest (both hall noise and neighbors) was minimum... bed was comfortable nice shower..... Only real reason to stay here is for Eataly or if your seeing a show at their theatre.
50,The location of the hotel is right on the strip. You can easily access multiple other casinos. There’s even a tram to the Bellagio hotel that is free. Check-in and checkout is easy there is even an app to keep up with your reservation at the status of your room. They even emailed us an Uber code for $20 off our Uber ride.
30,Was promised a king room received 2 double beds called to resolve the problem 3 times and could not get the front desk to answer. AC did not work well room was hot. The amenities were great! We went for a concert the theater was awesome. Love the eataly
10,Carpet was disgusting and made my kids feet black and had cigarette burns in it. AC was broken and front desk just said to try to turn it on again ourselves. (Has already done that) Didn’t get fixed until my kids were asleep at midnight. But the maintenance worker was awesome! He was the only good thing about the hotel. Overall gross and old and would never recommend!
40,We came specifically for the Aerosmith concert and had a great time. We spent less than 20 hours total on our mini adventure but would definitely do it again. It would be great if the merchandise was available at a discount if you stay with the hotel or available online.
10,The rooms are very stark and unwelcoming. There's no room to put your clothes in the tiny closet and mini drawers. There's one shared door that can either open the bathroom or the closet very strange! The pillows were so over stuffed they hurt your neck!
30,The Park MGM has had a nice redesign but if you are looking for a QUIET room for your vacation or convention stay this is NOT the place for you.    We have stayed at all of the better MGM hotels on the Strip (MGM Mandalay Park Aria Bellagio etc...) and the PARK MGM is by far the noisiest hotel we have ever stayed. It's very disappointing considering the hotel just underwent a major renovation and noise issues should have been addressed during the redesign.    The ball-chain system used for the window coverings is the biggest fail we have ever encountered in a Vegas MGM hotel. You can hear when your neighbours above below and beside your room are raising or lowering the blinds. It sounds like they are in the room with you doing it! At 9am after 4-5 hours sleep it is a sound that will jar you from your slumber. It's an awful design decision and should seriously be looked at for replacement.    Also the NoMad pool party outside our room was very loud and obnoxious at 11am. The start time for the pool party should probably be reconsidered at since I'm sure other guests like us didn't appreciate being woken at 11am by bad EDM...
40,Good trip considering cost of flight and hotel combo. Casino floor very smoky this year. Park pool is good Nomad pool very expensive. We found they lacked food alternatives late at night. We would go back but would be making sure our reservation is confirmed prior to arrival.
50,Very convenient.  Rooms close to the pool. Starbucks close to the elevators.  Nice Italian market area.  Casino with good variety of slots.  Good location. Friendly staff.  If using MLife credit card lots of freeplay and food credit. :)
40,From check-in to check-out everything is computerized- you don't have to speak to a person - very impersonal!  The rooms have all been updated - but not very attractive - with a big couch and a very big table in the room (is it supposed to be a dining room table not sure). An old fashion swag lamp is draped across the ceiling and hangs over the table - not very attractive! But then again you are in Vegas and don't spend too much time in the room anyway.
40,Nice remodeled affordably hotel. Nothing over the top but nice clean experience. Hotel remodeled nicely. Not luxurious but for the price pretty good. Had a 2 queen suite at a good price. Only problem with the room is that it didn't come with microwave or mini fridge. No real gripes about this place. Nice hotel at good price.
30,Very dissatisfied with this trip. Additional 400.00 in charges for a 3 night stay. Rooms were dated and layed out poorly especially the bathroom/closet. Also food and drink were excessively high. Location was good and it was easy to get anywhere on the strip or freemont street with just a 8 dollar a day bus pass.
50,If you’re middle age older or just like to relax you will feel right at home here! 3 pools to enjoy and super friendly staff. Close to all amenities for shopping! Try the beautiful Italian themed food court called Eataly it’s so good especially the hand made pizzas and the best gelato I’ve ever had!!! If you need mobility they also have scooters to rent which I highly recommend! Nice clean new rooms for your relaxing pleasure!
50,We enjoyed our stay the only things we didn't like was the check in process I prefer to have a real person greet me.  I had trouble finding our reservation. The room was on 4th floor overlooking the roof with pipes & air conditioning units. Bad view.
40,Decent property with good location on the strip. The highlight is the Eataly food court. Amazing food and wine. The homemade gelato is worth a trip by itself. The casino is nothing special but you are right next to Aria which is.
50,Hotel and guest rooms were amazingly clean and the bed was super comfy. Great central location to everything in Vegas. Plenty of different restaurants within the hotel for everyone. No complaints from me. Will stay here again on my next visit.
40,The Park MGM is on the lot where the Monte Carlo used to be next to New York New York and the new public square called The Park. The hotel is modern with digital kiosks for check-in and check-out and nicely appointed reasonably comfortable rooms with more TV channels than most casinos.    The intimate Park Theater is home to popular music stars (most recently Lady Gaga) and local bands play in The Park every weekend. Restaurants include a friendly sports bar (The Money Line) a terrific noodle bar (LuLu) a pleasant brunch room (Primrose) a high-end steak house and the large and popular Eataly -- Mario Batali's food station concept where you can get food prepared for you or buy groceries to take home; there are several pizza stations a charcuterie stand a fish monger a pastry and coffee bar pasta restaurants and even a grappa bar.    One thing that I thought was odd though was the presence of families with small children on the casino floor which is where you have to walk through to get to the eateries. Also there is NO COFFEE in the rooms or in the lobby - you have to stand in the very long Starbuck's line order from one of the restaurants or wait for a cocktail waitress to come buy on the casino floor (and they are few and far between). There's a general store open 24/7 but the prices are comparable to what you'd pay at a big event ($7 for a bottle of Aquafina water for example and $5 for a pack of Tic-Tacs)
50,Great stay! Wife and I visit Vegas about twice a year and are M life members! First time staying here and it will not be our last! Great helpful service and easy check in. Newly renewed rooms are fantastic. Bed was the best hotel bed my wife and I have ever experienced. Great location on the strip and tons of restaurants and bars all around. The park is fantastic. Pool is less crowded then other pools and has a good vibe. All in all will be back soon!
30,Check-in experience where humans are replaced by machines leaves room for many questions left unanswered unless you have all day to track down employees. No mini fridge in room no hard liquor on room service menu. A/C was not working properly and when it did work it made a very loud noise. This hotel is supposed to be brand new yet it feels like it's falling apart a little bit. The shower was more like a tepid waterfall NO pressure at all took forever to wash the shampoo from my hair.
40,This is a great stay for seeing a concert at the Park MGM Theater. Easy access great restaurants and good rooms. We left the concert and were back in our room in five minutes. Dinner the night before at Manzo was stellar!
50,Everything seemed well planned out and easy to find throughout the property. Bed was very comfortable and the pillows and comforter were just right. Ate at Eataly and food was good and came fairly quickly. Great value for what we paid for the room. This will be our go to from here on out as long as prices stay reasonable.
20,Did not like the check in service when we got there. I asked the attendant was I getting a handicap room as my husband needed not a tub but just the shower. She said all rooms on the 17th floor had them but of course our room #218 did not it had the tub.  There is no check in counter with a attendant just the machines where you input and have to wait for one to come around when they can but they are not full attentive to answering the questions on what you need to ask about the room. After I entered all my information and scanned in my ID and credit card through their machine I get a notice that the room is not ready and I would have to wait for a bar code to be texted to me when it would be available. I asked the attendant then how long this would be she said she did not know. So hear we are with luggage and others waiting around with our luggage to get this code. I had no desire to lug luggage to the casino or the restaurant while we waited. I went to concierge and asked they had a place to put our luggage while we waited for the room and she said yes at the bell desk and they were very helpful and kind to us in holding our luggage while we waited. It took about 1 1/2 hr to finally get bar code but was disheartening we had to reenter the line (now its busy with other guests) to recheck in for printing of the key. A lot of wasted time for checking in and I can't imagine on a busy day this area must look like.  We were assigned the 17th floor and the view was great for the strip and the room was fine except no fridge and not area to place luggage. The bathroom had the tub that I requested not to have but after all the hassle of checking in and my husband not feeling to redoing this charade again with the front desk self check in we reluctantly decided to stay put. Luckily we were there for one day. The next day when housekeeping was dong the rooms next to us we could see they had the shower only we requested. For some someone like me I like the personal interaction of an employee versus the machine type then again maybe for others they prefer that type of service.Like another reader stated many taxes resort fee resort fee taxes on top of the that plus room tax the room comes out more than expected. The room was clean and tidy.The valet and Bell desk were very professional. Not sure if we would stay there again if they can not get this check in service resolved to my liking.  A great plus was the Park Theater is very convenient to get to and the seating is great for seeing concerts. That was one thing the casino offered was the convenience and access to the venue we were going to.
40,Sound insulation between the rooms is poor. Normal discussion can be heard from the other room. Restaurant selection (fake Italian style) is limited e.g. needed to go to a nextdoor hotel to get a breakfast.
50,The park MGM had such a grand renovation I almost forgot it was the monte Carlos at one point. The staff was great the food was great but my favorite part was the room I want to redo my room to replicate it. It was so beautiful!
20,M Life staff is rude. Beds are very soft and become uncomfortable to sleep on by the second night. AC in room was below average had to set it on 60 just to get the room cool. Could here noise from others room through walls like people closing their window shades. Remodel on rooms was very poor.
10,The lack of customer service provided to resolve a simple request to move to a mechanically functioning room was ignored and the staff was busy talking to each other when I inquired on the staus of my inquiry. Never again!
30,I spent 3 nights here in June 2019 with my partner we had a King Bed Strip View room.    The room was a decent size with a nice modern finish and the strip view was great. The bathroom was also fine and modern. The room was one of the 'adjoining room' type rooms so we could hear the people in the room next to us very clearly which I personally find very annoying and makes me feel like we have no privacy. For me that's a big downside.    There is no fridge or coffee making facilities in the room (but there is an ice machine in the hall). To get coffee you have to go to the Starbucks downstairs which charges double what you pay in a regular Starbucks. As an everyday coffee drinker I found this quite annoying! The Eataly downstairs is also very expensive.    Resort fees get added to your room fee so it ends up being quite pricey.    The pool area is excellent with 3 pools that are great. Good bar snacks and drinks menu.    Location of Park MGM is fantastic right in the heart of the strip.    Overall our stay was good but I felt that the renovated modern feel of the hotel was a bit on the small side in terms of a Vegas room and the adjoining room thing/lack of reasonably priced coffee was a pain. I'd probably check other hotel options next time.
40,I liked that this hotel is mid strip so it was convenient to everything. It was smaller than MGM Grand so it was much easier to find my way around. I got lost at MGM grand. Stayed here for the Paul McCartney concert and it is literally across the street from TD arena so it was perfect.    The Eatly options were nice however they seemed very expensive. Room rate was good with MGM rewards but the resort fee plus taxes was almost the same amount as the room rate.    The room was nice but a little odd. It had a large couch by the window and a table. But no fridge no place to put luggage (laid it open on the floor). Could hear music on the 7th floor. Detail to cleaning could be better. I noticed dust on the picture frames and window sill was dirty. Could see mold in the toilet and bathtub overflow. One of the clean towels had black marks on it.    Pool closes at 8pm. This is the desert and a city that never sleeps. A late night swim would have been nice. Especially considering they charge a resort fee for what??    Check out was a fiasco. The system was down so we could not check out on our TV in the room. Went downstairs and all the kiosks were down and since it was 3am the only hotel employee available was at the VIP desk and said system down.
50,I travel a lot world wide. Park MGM was excellent in every way possible. The rooms are nice and I got a good price on mine. The restaurants at the hotel that I tried were good but very expensive. I came to see Aerosmith. The venue being at the hotel was fantastic.
30,Check in process needs work. Kiosk system should make it simple but rooms weren’t ready till way after check in time. Staff needs attitude adjustment. Every person we encountered were rude testy or sassy. The hotel was great! Beds were great! Very Clean! Very nice pool area!
20,The hotel was fine. The Park Theater ushers are better suited for prison guards. I went to see Aerosmith on July 7. I splurged for a seat on the floor in Section 101. You would only find a better behaved crowd in Sunday school. (Consider the age group and the price of tickets.) No drunks no standing on seats no one dancing in the aisles. The ushers were obnoxious. 30 minutes before the show started I stepped into an empty row of seats to take a picture of a stilt walker and the guard/usher stopped me and ordered me back to my seat. Who was I bothering? I didn't argue. During the show If you stepped outside of the boundary of your seat by inches they converged. If a drink spilled at least 4 of them showed up to mop and supervise. I'm 5' tall. My enjoyment of EVERY song was interrupted by overzealous theater employees policing something. Theater staff would be better suited to the prison system. Seeing Aerosmith was a dream experience for me but the reality was so disappointing.
20,Great location. Rooms are not impressed! We had a king with red painted wall so not relaxing. There is 2 tiny drawers that cannot hold anything for 2 people. Live out of the suitcase for 4 days. The sink is flat so doesn’t drain right. We came in for the Aerosmith concert excellent concert! Wouldn’t stay again.
20,Rooms: no bathtub only shower no dresser if you are like me and like to unpack. Couch along windows which is nice.    Pools: less like Vegas Hotel and more like the community pool (concrete Jungle)    Food: If you have Little kids plan on eating elsewhere (the hotel doesn't seem like it wants to cater to families
10,Not impressed .. Staff acted like they dont have time for your questions. Put do not disturb sign on door but they went in room anyways . Not happy with my choice wont be back. We loved it when it was Monte Carlo new updates not impressed
30,You are not getting the best bed or greatest restroom. Tub floor was coming apart limited towels clogged tub and leaking head. LOCATION was great for us for the concert. Good places near by to walk.
20,Noticed not enough payouts plus not enough card tables. Rooms lacked amenities sink area was horrible-sink wouldn’t drain entire sink plus area stained easily so whole area stayed dirty and we’re not messy people. Never found Front Desk. Not enough info shown about events going on at hotel. Pretty much spent most of time at New York New York next door. Not enough places to eat and misc sundry item shops were small and opened late in the day.  Staff very courteous though..
40,I went for the 4th of July Long weekend with a bunch of family members parties we rented a cabana at the Park pool the security guy was a little aggressive on searching “ the bags” which It made us uncomfortable  the pool staff was very friendly and helpful  we enjoy the ambience and music on the pool and jacussy 
30,No fridge is provided in the room or a mini bar. Overall the casino is nice and clean. Love that there are so many places to eat and to hangout. I love that is very convenient that you can walk to different hotel/casino
20,Dirty Rooms and folks smoking marijuana through vents room smelled like skunk the entire time. The front desk lady was very kind and helpful would hate to put her under this category. The Eatly was also amazing.
40,Everything was great I just wish the room can be colder temperature. The ac unit was set at the coldest temp and the coolest temp was about 70 degrees. But everything else was really nice along with the staff
40,Great place for a stay in the heart of the Strip. Comfortable rooms and beds. Not so crowded as other hotels in the area since there are not many shops here except for the Eataly (which is great!!!) and the Starbucks. On the down side room service is just not worth it overly priced (that's no surprise) cold food arrives to the room in disposable containers with plastic cuttlery.
40,We stayed here while going to the Aerosmith concert and really liked it. It is the old Monte Carlo hotel and has been refurbished. It is in a good area you can walk right out and have a million things to see and do. It is right across the street from New York New York and there is a Denny's CVS and Bobby Flay's burger palace right out the door. We stayed in a NightHawk suite and it was nice and roomy. I will say everything is expensive in the minibar the stores (snacks and wateretc.) and restaurants but most hotels in Vegas up charge for everything so it's to be expected. Also like all the hotels on the strip you'll be charged with a resort fee so be prepared for that. I liked that the hotel and casino were a bit smaller than most so you didn't get lost. Also there are many great eats. Bavette's steakhouse (pricey) Starbucks and then a lot of little bars and eateries in a section called Eataly. Great service throughout the hotel. The spa is very nice-includes a sauna and whirlpool. The resort has a pool area with three pools as well. Good stay.
20,Not the room on the strip that i booked. Then no a/c in room. Also try not to leave anything in the room. You will not get it back!! No mini fridge or microwave. The halls are so dark and uninviting. Just overall not a good experience.
40,My wife and I decided to stay at the renovated Park MGM in a stay well room. It was very comfortable except for the smell of marijuana every evening. The room was clean and the blinds kept out almost all light in the morning.    The hotel has a new dining experience called Eataly that I would highly recommend.    The three guest pools are very clean and comfortable. The only drawbacks are they aren't open late and are shaded in the morning due to being surrounded by tall buildings.    All in all a very nice place to stay with a great Strip location.
40,"I have stayed in the Monte Carlo a couple times so decided to give Park MGM a try since I like the location on the strip and it was newly renovated. The location is great and the place is beautifully redone. One major change is the removal of a food court in the back of the hotel and the addition of Eataly in the front. The food in Eataly was delicious...we enjoyed breakfast pasteries waffles pizza sandwiches and more. Things can be a little pricier but I had a $125 food and drink credit when booking my room.    However be careful if you have such a credit. I did go to the front desk a few times to check my balance. Eataly Charges are not automatically applied for the credits so you need to keep checking on them. In the end I did not receive $10 of my food credits but they were able to adjust it when I called even though I had checked out 5 days prior.    The 3 pools were beautiful with plenty of ""free"" seating by them. The water is even cooled for the summer so it was very refreshing.    The room was very comfortable. Unlike some reviews I read the AC worked great! People also complained about the lack of drawer space but I made due. I agree a dresser would have been nice.    The main reason for the trip was to see Areosmith and they did not disappoint. The Park Theater is a great venue to see a show. With only 5200 seats there really isn't a bad one in the house.    One issue I had was the lack of power the evening of the concert in our room. There was no electricity so I was getting ready in a dark room that got warm very quickly because no AC (100+ degree weather when I was there). Due to that inconvenience I received a credit for my resort fees which I felt was a fair compensation. The front desk was very helpful with that credit.    The kiosk check in was very fast and convenient. There were plenty of staff members there to assist you if you had any questions or problems during the check in process. It was much better than waiting in long lines that I saw as I was going through some of the other hotels.  Overall a great trip!"
30,I was a bit disappointed with the room not having coffee maker refrigerator or clock. The resort/casino overall is nice with good food and bar choices. Location is great for walking to other near by attractions!
40,I was a frequent visitor of the hotel the Park MGM replaced so I was a bit anxious to see what was different. The important things to me are the pool and location. I liked both. The lack of sound barrier between the rooms was annoying. For the cost of my stay I shouldn’t need earplugs in order to sleep in peace. I enjoyed Juniper Lounge and browsing through Eataly. I would come back and hopefully get a room with a better sound barrier.
20,Our room was maybe cleaned once during our stay. Many occasions we had to call to front desk to prompt housekeeping to bring us towels. On one occasion it took over 30 mins to receive towels just to take a shower! Will not stay here again.
20,The location of this hotel is great! Very close to many hotels and sight seeing on the strip. Unfortunately that's where the great ends.  The rooms are very small which is fine but there is absolutely no storage in the room. No dressers no nightstands and only 6 hangers. In the bathroom There was also nowhere to put your belongings. There is plenty of room in the room to add dressers. Get rid of the big bulky table and put dressers. That way there would be storage AND a table top(top of dresser). I do not like living out of my suitcase and that's exactly what I had to do. Bummer it could be
40,This was our first time staying here as the Park MGM. We have stayed here twice as the Monte Carlo. Boy how things have changed!! We always liked the location on The Strip. The addition of Eataly definitely changed the entrance. Eataly was not cheap but the areas were ALWAYS filled. Had a few things from different sections and everything was good.    My biggest negative comment is the hallways on the floors are dark. Improper lighting and the entrance way to each of the rooms is painted dark (either black or a really dark green so dark I couldn't tell) which made the room numbers really hard to see.    They definitely need to add more lighting for safety and security reasons. Also mattress low to the ground. No box spring only a platform. Took a day or two to get used to it.
20,Somethings in Vegas just don't need to be changed. Park MGM ruined a perfectly good hotel. From the hideous exterior faded green to the dark green carpets and green interior rooms. I left like I was swimming in a never ending jar of Gerber baby food... Smashed peas addition. I love resting in my room and enjoying the hotel. I couldn't wait to leave. My boyfriend wanted to check out immediately. Don't get me wrong service was decent. Check in was a nightmare since the kiosk wouldn't print my room key and no one was available to assist with checking in. Human touch when checking in goes a long way. Forced to check in with a half way working kiosk put a bad taste in my mouth from the beginning. With all of the renovating that was done they could have used some extra sound proofing. I heard every neighbors entire life story.
10,Made reservations months ago . We were traveling from LAX to Las Vegas I called 3 times on the way there to let them know we were still on our way and everytime they said sure we are noting on your room ..LIARS I get there and they said sorry you didnt call so you dont have a room mind you we had just traveled 4 hours to get there we were exhausted and needed to sleep.then they give us a room and it's not even ready for people to go in. And the bed is LOCKED. Upon leaving they tryed to make us pay for parking after its suppose to be free for pearl members BUT SINCE my card doesnt say that they wouldnt honor it!!!!
50,The hotel location was amazing right in the center of the strip the rooms were great very clean and the beds are really comfortable and the curtains were really nice because they let no light in which is great after staying up late the pool was really nice too and the staff.
20,We come here about 2 or 3 times a year we love it and come back to this hotel because of the location and the place is usually top notch. This year however our room stank of weed for 2 days we finally got moved to another room. We were told it would be an upgrade. It was filthy and the shower was clogged. There was fruit and candy wrappers on the grown and the walls were covered in handprints. The manager told us he would give us 3 days off the resort fee but on our bill only two days were credited not the biggest deal in the world but that coupled with everything else was the straw that broke the camel's back. We are really disappointed as we love it here. Not sure if we will return we might try somewhere else. Sad to think the place has great potential to be our one stop shop. Location great and facilities are fantastic. Just this time we had a really poor experience. Time will tell.
10,This was the worst hotel experience I have ever had. Not only did MGM Grand let our party check in & issue us a room to SOMEONE ELSES ROOM (we should have realized we were at the wrong hotel but so should have the hotel before they ISSUED A KEY TO ANOTHER PERSONS ROOM WHERE THEY HAD BELONGINGS VISIBLE). A man let himself into our room at 2:00am with a master key to deliver a fridge that was NOT requested. This was the most terrifying experience of all as we were not expecting someone to attempt to enter our room in the middle of the night. With a master key. I will never stay here ever again.
50,I don’t what to say it was a good experience I’m coming back for sure I don’t what you guys what me to type in here why is there a 200 minimum I like my feedback short and sweet this hotel is awesome
50,It's nice to go to a hotel where everyone who works there seems to be enjoying what they are doing. Top notch service all around and a fantastic stay for summer vacation. Plenty of food options and as for nightlife On The Record is a wonderful spot!
50,The Park MGM is a great value for the money. Friendly staff great rooms easy parking. Located near the strip it was easy access to all of the entertainment I wanted to experience. I would recommend this hotel
50,I had a wonderful experience at Park MGM! The rooms are beautiful and very modern with many great amenities that made my stay very comfortable and functional as well. We had a great view and loved the window seat so much! We plan on another stay really soon!
30,the location of this hotel is what makes it good for me the price was high for what you get and they charge for parking even if you stay there. I was quoted one price then got charged more. There is one fabulous place to eat at this hotel Eataly
50,Had a fantastic stay. Rooms were clean and comfortable. Service was great. Everything about our stay met everything we needed. Being close to the Tmobile Arena was a huge plus.plus the dining experience at the Eatery inside the hotel was mouthwatering good.
30,There are no refrigerators microwaves or coffee makers in the rooms. Air conditioning would not cool the room. I had to go down and request our room be cleaned twice in 1 day and only once on the next day. Resort fee is a little high. Requires an extra $500 deposit at check in never read that in their online reservation system.
50,Wonderful location and service with lots within walking distance. Friendly staff from hotel to pool. Get the full Vegas experience without getting lost or waiting for service like in the other massive resorts. It’s all here in a great package!
30,The rooms have no amenities but a high First time stay with a heft resort fee and both to show for it. Location great but not worth the cost and resort fee. As hot as the weather was (triple digits) servers barely had bottled water like they were rationing them out. No amenities in room a fee to have a fridge.
40,I can't say that anything was out of the ordinary. The area has certainly been cleaned up around Park MGM. The Eataly is pretty awesome. The Park right outside is better than ever. The hotel itself is what you would expect. Middle of the road. Room was clean but did smell like smoke. But very affordably priced. Check-in process was decent and got my room early.    Room was a little different than most I've stayed at but roomy enough...decor was ok. Bathroom was nice and clean.    Went to Aerosmith at the arena and the place was set up pretty well.    Gaming was fine as well.    Overall good value hotel.
40,Was able to check in early at 8am via my cell phone!! Letting them know when my flight would arrive they had everything prepared right away and I checked in early. For those who want bottles of liqour CVS and ABC markets close by for cheaper drinks. Also gorgeous area for Italian eats at Eatly and the ease and access to all parts of the strip were accessible via tram and short walks. The pool area was filled was kiddos and wasn't the best in comparison to Mandalay bay or the MGM's pools. All in all if you like easy access to all hotels and casinos this place is for you!
40,We stayed over 4th of July. Staff friendly and helpful. Clean room although bathroom rather small if there are two women. Not much counterspace. Rented cabana for 3 days. Staff very good. North pool gets shaded around 3:00.
40,Location Location Location!!!  The resort is located in between New York New York and Aria Cadinos. There is a free tram that connects MGM Park with Aria and Bellagio. The rooms are clean and nicely decorated. The casino floors are clean and the slot machines are spaced nicely all over the floor. There is a multicolored Water Park outside and the famous Eataly Place serving famous Italian delicacies. Lots of shops and restaurants around. I highly recommend this resort!!!
50,Had a good trip with my friends  small attitude at the dice table from staff but was fixed very fast  nice location  nice cafe  nice rooms ..... I’ll be back soon to enjoy it again for my birthday
30,Stayed here 4 nights and think they need to make some changes/improvements if they want a higher rating (or maybe they don't care?).  The pros - Room was spacious and clean and pretty quiet and the bed was comfy. The bathroom was great - particularly the shower though there were some issues with the shower door.  Pool area was nice. We rented a cabana and our personal server (Sylvia) was awesome!  Location was O.K. and there is a tram to take you to Bellagio which helps with walking in the hot sun.  Overall look of the hotel was pretty good though I would have preferred a different color scheme - the bright red and dark green in the rooms wasn't too appealing.  The cons - checking in was a nightmare (as others have mentioned on TA). We arrived at midnight and it was hard to find anyone to help with the kiosk check-in. We checked out at 5 A.M. and again - no one at the desk. Finally just dropped the keys as we had to get to the airport.  I have rarely seen a hotel that shuts down restaurants and bars so early. This is Vegas people!!!!!  Wi-fi was spotty at best and yet you are paying for wi-fi with the resort fee. Aggravating!!!  Our AC could not be set below 65 (although our friends in the adjoining room could lower their's to 60). In any case - the AC sucked!!! It's over 100 outside and they can't give you cooler rooms? Made it uncomfortable to sleep.  Overall I would not stay here again unless I got an unbelievable rate!
30,"I found the staff here seems to be in hurry in directing or helping guests with their questions when they are not busy at all. They are walking back and forth doing nothing since all the check-ins and check-outs are now self-served. They should be more patient and friendlier to guests when asked for assistance with those new machines. The hotel should have at least a coffee maker so guests can make their own coffee teas or boil water for their own needs. I found it hard to accept that a 4-star hotel like this does not have a coffee maker mini-fridge or kettle in the room. No all people are ""Starbucks"" coffee drinkers. It was a nightmare to stay here for almost a week with no buffet available."
50,The Park MGM is a beautiful remodel and so convenient. It feels upscale and intimate but with all the amenities. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The restaurants were excellent and Eataly is so amazing!
10,Not a good experience poor housekeeping minimal restaurant selection shower leaked room not refreshed had to call for towels  Check in kiosk is a pain in the butt reserved king but they tried dumping us in queen had to go back to lobby and complain to get what we paid for.
50,This was my first time traveling to Las Vegas. I was coming out solely for the Aerosmith concert. I was pleasantly surprised about the room rates and ended up staying for a few days. The hotel was lovely the pool was great and the concert theatre is amazing. Eataly is great and you could easily have a different meal every time you go around there. The other restaurants were pretty pricey but it was nice having a lot of options for my cousin who is a vegan. The location is great for getting anywhere around the strip. I would definitely stay here again in the future.
30,They don’t have coffee machines in the rooms and the only place to get it is at Starbucks where you have to wait in a long 20-30 person line for a solid half hour for it. There are also no mini fridges in the room either. It’s about as basic as you get for a hotel room.
30,The Park MGM was overpriced for the accommodations. We arrived to the Park MGM after a 4.5 hour flight. We had to check ourselves through the computer which I felt was a cold process. Whatever happened to hotel hospitality?
40,We used to come here when it was the Monte Carlo. The old classy open lobby has morphed into a darker space with a park motif. The reincarnated public areas brim with garden/forest images: thick tree branch on ceiling olive green color theme lattice-like frames pictures & paintings of parks everywhere. A restaurant stands where the long front desk used to be. Check-in is now high-tech. While helpful staff are on hand with tablets to assist guests proceed to stations with screens similar to airport self-service kiosks to scan ID process credit card and print room keys. Our room on 23rd floor with bright red shades a long sturdy couch a leather sofa chair and brightly-lit bathroom with cheerful red shower wall tiles is at once retro hip and modern. In-room “Stay Well” features including purified air circadian lighting memory foam bed energizing mirror light all helped enhance comfort and enjoyment. Unfortunately persistent loud chattering from the neighboring room seeping through the connecting door seriously negated the sense of well-being and privacy. Lobby/casino level boasts many new fancy eateries and shops (loved Eataly). There’s air-conditioned indoor connection to nearby premier hotels. Overall the changes wisely optimize space use and modernize stay experience. Efforts to maximize guest satisfaction are evident throughout. Personally I feel it’s a bit dark in this makeover. Self-park structure exit signage could be improved.
50,Beautiful hotel and great service. I had family coming from Mexico and decided to take them to Vegas and I choose this hotel because the price and location and i am glad i did because we had a good time.  Rooms where clean and nice service was great and they have 3 pools one it is only for adult people so it is good and the water was ok no so hot not so cold.
40,The hotel check-in check-out was very easy. Rooms were quiet clean and maintained everyday. Staff was very helpfull and friendly. If you want coffee in the morning get there early it's very busy and not fast. Also has a poor selection for morning eats.
20,Self check in had lots of issues reading the drivers license. Received a room that was filthy from prior guests that had not been clean despite being told that room was ready/clean. Fixed after an hour
10,No digital key access room were small and housekeeping not doing their job correctly. Had a better experience at the Excalibur for half the price and room was larger and cheaper. Pools are small and NoMad pool is way to loud to be relaxing. Definitely not recommended for a peaceful vacation.
50,We stayed at the hotel for one week! We were pleasantly surprised. I loved how quiet the room was. The purification can be turned on loud so you have no noise. The room was clean and spacious. We also loved our view. The service was for the most part friendly except for VIP....
40,Overall we had a great experience. I wish there were more food options during the day and late night. Our shows were both over after 11 pm on weekend nights and we could not get food afterwards. More variety of food options would also be nice. Mexican sushi burgers etc. While the location is convenient in relation to the T-Mobile Arena it’s nearly impossible to get a Rideshare pick up after a show. The pick up location is blocked off and drivers can’t get there. We had to walk to Aria and then it still took us over an hour to get from the Park to the other end of the strip. The Juniper Lounge is great for craft cocktails. Eataly was great although it is definitely expensive.
50,Recommend this hotel for anyonelooking for the perfectly located hotel. With beautifully modern and spotless decorated rooms. Easy check in. Also the staff where very friendly.I really enjoyed the patio seating for breakfast.
20,Newer resort and casino on the strip needs some work to do to catch up to the big names. No refrigerator in the king suites so you cant buy bottle water and put it in your room to keep cold .  Ac runs only a certain time before it kicks ass and its 90 to 100 degrees outside.  Eatley has nice places to sit and eat  lots of choices from pasta to seafood to desserts and plenty of wine bars .  Park Theater was amazing for sound but need more bathrooms throughout .  And if you are looking for a good night sleep  one of the main reasons I wont return there is a nightclub open til 4 am and I'm guessing if your in a certain area or rooms you can hear the bass til they close .
50,Beautiful place and good service.  The room is nice and roomy. The hotel is in the center of the strip. Easy to access to other hotel and famous places. The price is reasonable. The food court is nice and the food is good and cheap.
50,Loved the service! Room was great convenient and clean....vip service with Justin was so wonderful. Will be back in 6 months and will book with you. Thanks for making our stay great also loved the spa.
50,Great trip great weather nice motel would stay again great food choices booze kinda expensive great venue for concerts not a bad seat in the house.did win a little money on slots lots of new slots
40,The Park Theater venue is excellent. It's a good size and you can see well from anywhere. Very convenient to stay at the attached Park MGM. Staff were very friendly and helpful. The room had thin walls and we could clearly hear things from the next room. There are lots of restaurants and stores nearby.
30,power outage! lasted for hours hotel would not communicate with guests front desk would not answer phone calls! Was left in hot room in the dark with no one to let me know anything! i made several phone calls no one would answer any phones anywhere!
10,The Park MGM visit was very disappointing- I am a big fan of the MGM resorts but super disappointed with the Park MGM - let’s start with the dark decor maybe this set the mood - the long walk down the dark green hall was very somber - the staff mimic that feeling the bar tenders were more worried about how many session point I was earning vs trying to talking to me - engaging the client would keep them playing - I played plenty to make that comment - we moved to the floor with hopes of finding a waitress - well guess what ? That didn’t happen. Very disappointed with the vibe at the Park MGM -    Oh ! But the Aerosmith concert was amazing - good thing we didn’t need any service
10,The rooms are for the millennial on the go. There is nothing that makes the room feel more than a place to sleep. There is no coffee maker and no mini bar/fridge no ironing board and just a shower. No tub.
20,Location was fine. Ambiance was nice. Rooms were very hot ac hardly worked we were only on the third floor. Check in was a nightmare check in was 3pm we didn’t get a room till after 5. Was suppose to have a strip view and we were given a view of construction opposite the strip. I don’t think we will be back.
50,Family and friends vacation. Once a year we travel as a group. This was my third time staying here and it is always a pleasure. All the employees are nice and helpful. Always clean rooms and the employees are willing to help you with anything
10,I reserved a room with a king size bed in Feb 2019. I arrived the 3rd week in June only to be told there were no rooms with a king size bed available. Please tell me how a hotel can confirm a reservation in Feb for a trip in June and then not provide one? One other thing I found very strange there was no dresser in the room to put your clothes in. Two of us were there for a week and lived out of our suitcases
50,The Park MGM Is My Favorite Vegas Hotel For Many Reasons. This is a recently revamped hotel & is very modern Its situated on the main strip & has a new Eatalia food court absolutely amazing Theater has some of the biggest starts Bruno Mars & Cher It has several top class restaurants & bars The Bavetts steak house is one of the best ive been to anywhere.The Rooms are a comfortable size with all amenities. Also has a medium to large Casino & High roller section. Will be back again Soon.
40,Arrival was simple as we did the online check in and signed it at the kiosks. Received our keys and up to the room. Room was clean but if you might want to ensure that you get a room with a frig MW individual coffee maker. Ours did not have these and I'm kind of spoiled by staying at Marriott. Maybe The Park needs to up there game.
40,The Park MGM is a huge improvement from its predecessor. Everything is new and clean. The remodeled rooms are very well done but a bit small. There's no room to store anything. We really enjoy the theme and look of the resort. The new pools are very nice. The music is a bit too loud and seem louder then most other casinos. The loud music seems to go against their more natural theme and certainly doesn't provide for a relaxing atmosphere. Eataly is fantastic and is definitely something we'll visit every time we're in Vegas. Their spa is nice.
50,This is our Hotel. Period. The staff location value and hotel amenities can’t be matched. Having the Starbucks right off the elevators is great especially after a typical Vegas night. Also being connected to the tram is a plus!
50,Great service great location we were able to walk to everywhere. Pool service was excellent and a great bartender. Cab service is always available if needed. The beds are extremely comfortable. Great vacation.
30,We used a promotion on the booking so the room was reasonably priced. It included $125 food/beverage credit. Eataly is a nice concept but the food is mediocre and the crowds and noise make it unpleasant. The server at Primrose couldn't manage to refill our coffee and the food was just not very good. Shout out to Josque at the Primrose bar who got us breakfast on the next four mornings; he is friendly and really cares about customers and refills hot coffee without being asked. The room was nicer than expected and housekeepers were friendly although we did not choose to have the room serviced. Check-in is ridiculously inefficient as other reviews state. The noise and smoke are horrible - more so than other casinos. I'm not sure we would consider staying here again even if the room was free.
30,Park MGM Hotel and Casino is more of a budget type than a luxury hotel. Room furnishings are sparse with no clock in the room or dresser in the room; bathroom does not have a fan so the shower and flushing noises flow into the room; go for a 2-3 night cheaper than normal strip stay.
40,Great hotel. Friendly and patient front kiosk attendants. VERY comfy beds. AC worked fine. No dressers though. That's the only reason for not giving 5 stars. Had a concert at the Park Theater VERY convenient to get there and see it.
20,I think you upgraded from the previous hotel but not enough. I will be staying elsewhere. Pools were good Food was good service and interruptions of facilities were not good.    I would suggest Mirage Bellagio or MGM as your best options for the strip Hotels....sorry
20,The hotel’s power went out for two hours (third world country???); no way to reach front desk by phone; room is not furnished with drawers for storage; eat elsewhere—hamburger is $19; cocktails are $16. The whole stay was a “C” just OK.
20,They put us in a handicap room that wasn’t requested then wouldn’t change rooms. Have zero dressers no refrigerator even on request for insulin.  Drink service...nonexistent  Room service...expensive/small selection  Resort fees/taxes...RIDICULOUS!
50,Great place truly amazing pools the resort is very clean all staff is really helpful at all times must stay at park MGM parking structures are very close walking distance to main lobby just awesome resort thank you guys!!
40,The pool area was beautiful; just disappointing you couldn't bring a couple cans of beer in like other properties allow.  We tried 2 restaurants; both delicious.  Easy and friendly check-in/check-out.  Wide variety of table games and slots.
10,Came here on a 2 night comp. I would never stay here again even for free. First all check-in is electronic unless you are VIP. I have the MLife Visa card which gives me access to the VIP check-in with a real person. All is well until I get to my room and the key doesn't work. Then the door opens and a couple are in my room. Turns out they are in the process switching rooms because there is something wrong with this one. So my VIP treatment is getting an occupied and defective room that has not been sanitized before turn over. I go back to the lobby to complain and switch rooms except there is no one manning the check-in desk. I go to the bell desk to ask if they can call someone. The bellman says the hotel is short staffed and they have no way of contacting anyone at check-in. I walk over to the sister property next door the Nomad (which is in the same complex). I ask if they can help either getting a hold of somebody at Park to resolve my room situation. The guy goes to check and he can't find anyone at check-in either. I ask if he can check me in at the Nomad instead. He says he can give me an Atelier Suite but I would have to pay an upgrade fee $$. I ask if he can wave the fee given all my trouble. He says he does not have authority to do that but will ask his manager. I wait 15 minutes for a manager to show up. I explain my situation and he says he can't give me a room at the Nomad because they are sold out on night 2 of my stay. He gives me a basic room back at the Park no upgrade. Didn't even waive the resort fees. He promises a manager will contact me to take care of me and offer me a food credit of unknown amount. So far I have not been contacted by anyone in management or received any credit. This has soured my whole trip and I have lost all desire to gamble eat or spend any money at this property.
30,I stayed at Park MGM because I was seeing a show there. I really liked the check in process. Other than that I found the hotel relatively average. The casino is small. Not fantastic food choices. The housekeeping was sub par. Overall I would look for a different hotel next time. The Park Theater is spectacular however
50,Really nice place to stay spacious rooms very very clean everywhere. Elevator down walk through the lobby and in to see Aerosmith. Could it get any better. Check in easy check out easy. Beware of a $400 payment at check in invade you trash your room 🥳 (returned after checking out)
50,I enjoyed Park MGM. The room was very nice. I enjoyed the location. Overall the staff was friendly and helpful. Eataly is connected to this hotel and this was definitely a welcomed surprise! I would definitely stay here again.
30,We always stayed there when it was Monte Carlo. When we booke we just figured it was a fresh remodel all was changed. No real suites. The original food court was gone and new restaurants. The check in was do it yourself and very confusing. I will not go back.
40,We stayed in a King room at the Park MGM during our fifth visit to Las Vegas and it was the best hotel yet. The rooms were simple but clean and spacious with a good sized bathroom/shower and a small closet. The bed was very comfortable and there were many accessible plug ins. Housekeeping did an excellent job throughout our stay.  Check in was the only challenge for us even though we had read reviews and knew to expect self check in through kiosks it was still not a smooth process. We were given the wrong room type and although the staff assisting people at the kiosks were very helpful it still took quite awhile to get it figured out. We had no problem using the self checkout.  We used the pool area everyday and it was wonderful. There were three pools all slightly different and it was never any trouble to find a spot. The drinks poolside were expensive but comparable to most places in Vegas.  The Italian food court at the hotel “Eataly” was impressive - the croissants at breakfast were amazing.  We would stay here again anytime.
40,One of the better hotel/resort/casinos i been to..went for aerosmith..OMG WHAT A SHOW!!! stayed at park for 2 nights...shower has so much pressure...but beds were a little soft for me...room service was great first day..2nd day.. we waited 2 hours..then gave up...checked out found a dennys..its super close to the new york new york..get best of both places..felt safe..rooms were clean..tv was good..lots of channels for vegasthe valet was great super fast service..
50,was not sure we would stay here because of the negative reviews i was wrong the park is a great hotel/casino in vegas self check in was easy and there were alot of staff to helpthe room was big we has 2 queen beds large couch at window bathroom all tile with the best shower i have ever had great water pressure the air worked great room stayed cold all week the casino is huge alot of slots no problem getting a drink while playing slots aerosmith was great at park theater  it was a easy walk to t mobile and nyny the pools were very nice 3 large pools great bar and food service my only complaint was the lack of breakfast places to eat they only have primerose steak house which was very good but very expensive we ate every morning at nyny i would stay there again
30,Was bad experience room key and restaurant problems  Too short of staff in the front desk  The bed is too soft  Staff is unfamiliar with food credit took many phone calls to get when and how much to use  Even this survey is unclear why you need 200 characters as at minimum
50,What an amazing job they've done renovating and rebranding the Monte Carlo - kudos to MGM for the fabulous transformation.    We stayed here last year and the renovations were still ongoing. Now everything (almost) has been completed we lived it Eatily is incredible (if over priced) the polls is stunning with free parasols - fab in the desert heat.    We love the self service check in and I really can't understand negative comments about this. We were in our room from 5 minutes of walking into the hotel - so easy to use and for us a better experience.    The casino has renewed energy and was always really busy with drinks available - slots not too bad either with plenty of choice.    We had a green room this trip and preferred it to the red. Fantastic shower and bed - both needed for the jet lag!!!! We only had one issue with the 'barn don't when my wife decided to put her shoes on with her head in the wardrobe - we laugh about it now..........    We always take a pack of 10 cheap coat hangers as there's never enough - if recommend doing this as there isn't enough hangers available (we also left ours for the next occupants).    Would stay again in a heartbeat - thanks Park MGM for a fabulous trip.
50,My husband and I were recently in Vegas and chose the Park MGM to try out (we've been to Vegas 12 times and stayed in a different casino/hotel each time). We found the rooms clean the bed comfy and the view from our window was great overlooking the Sprint Arena area. I'm picky when it comes to cleanliness and this motel passed almost all my tests (I did find a couple hairs that weren't mine in the bathroom area). The casino is the perfect size big enough to have lots of variety but not so big you can't find each other. The pool area was great too and we had no trouble finding chairs together to lay out although we were there during the week and I would bet it gets quite busy on the weekends. I was most impressed with the Eataly area. I wish we would've explored that more but since we can be picky eaters we were rather cautious. We settled on an amazing ham and cheese sandwich.
30,The last part of May 2019 we stayed at the Park MGM in Las Vegas. We had a rollin shower with a king bed accessible room. The room reminded me of Motel 6 with better towels. The hotel is beautiful overall but when you are paying a $35 a day resort fee no mini-fridge or coffee maker it's outrageous! Starbucks gets expensive after 4 days! Motel 6 with better towels...
50,Loved this hotel. We got upgraded to a Staywell room with two queen beds because they were out of kings. It was so beautiful and fun. Loved the lighting and the art in the room. It felt really clean.    Ate at Eataly and went to On the Record.. Look for the hidden rooms :)
50,We stayed at the newly renovated Parkview MGM resort (previously Monte Carlo) on the strip. Everyone was very accommodating room service was delicious the casino is very convenient and check in/out is very simple and saves a lot of time when checking in on the self service kiosk. The rooms are so fresh and crisp decorated with a very modern industrial look the room we chose had 2 queen beds a very long red sofa as well as a table and 2 chairs the bathroom was so nicely updated with frameless glass shower with very white tile it was so clean! The bathroom was not very big and really not much counter space however the modern decor and the cleanliness of the entire room made up for that.  The hotel is right on the strip and anything you need is just steps away as well as the monorail. Needless to say that I will definitely stay here again! I enjoyed everything!
50,The hotel was very clean and the staff was friendly. There was no mini-fridge or bar which was disappointing. Other than that great location and great hotel! Highly recommend. Good food options as well.
40,We checked in at 11 am but our room wasn't ready till 7pm. My parents checked in at 12 and there room was already ready for them. We paid more for a suite and expected it to be ready prior to everyone else.
20,Customer service does not care about being helpful. When I was over billed for valet it took several trips and conversations to figure out who could fix the problem. The room was okay and cleaning staff exceptional but customer service isn’t there to make the experience great.
40,We came out to see Aerosmith's Dueces residency. We wanted to stay where we didn't need to worry about transportation. The Park was clean comfortable and I was surprised that the casino smoke smell was relatively light.
50,We recently spent 3 nights in Las Vegas and stayed at the Park MGM for the second time. This is a beautiful hotel on the south end of the strip. We go to Las Vegas each year for a mini vacation and always choose an MGM property. This is definitely my favorite property! It is clean beautiful and close to lots of restaurants.
30,The room was not equipped with coffee maker or dresser. Closet space was minimal hardly enough for two people and shared with bar and safe. So suitcases had to stay in sleep area. The nearest coffee supply was Starbucks which had odd business hours and doubled all their prices. We could not use the amenities because they were only open during the day. So if you are there for business you cannot use the pools or jacuzzi. There are plenty of eateries but all have long wait times. Nothing healthy and quick to grab and eat in your room or while lounging by the pool (which is closed anyway by 8pm).
10,Room decoration is low quality. Also staff has been poorly trained with respect to service. The hostess at the breakfast place was rude. Also there were many open tables and yet there was a long waitlist waiting for a table. Inefficient.The waitress at the Nomad pool never approached to take a drink order. The feeling is that there is a general lack of training.
30,Pay the extra money if you can to stay center strip. There is really no wow factor here unless you have tickets to see a show at the theater. Best Friends is nice and definitely have your drinks in the Jupiter lounge.
40,There are both pros and cons of the park MGM. My least favorite part is the digital check in as someone with two last names the system is completely incapable of helping me. I need to seek out a person to get assistance doing anything at the hotel. The rooms are repainted/touched up from the Monte Carlo days. Nothing super fancy but perfectly clean and comfortable! The pools are nice but as with all Vegas hotels very busy. I love how easy it is to get around the hotel and the casino isn’t large.
40,"The slick interior is cool although the all automation check-in is a real hassle. Regardless just outside the door is the heart of the Vegas enabling you to walk to everything. The pool(s) are great and the music although at times too loud sets the Vegas pool mood into action. You have to pay for a small frig that isn't filled with ""pay"" items and some of the windows haven't been washed in years. However if you going to a concert at the Park just walking downstairs is pretty cool. Plus the venue although large has great seating.."
50,Just saw Areosmith at the Park MGM Theatre it was an awesome experience even thou we were in the balcony the view was great and the sound system was THX very loud and clear. Don’t miss this show in this great venue. All the staff at the facility was so nice and helpful. Great Experience Thank You!
40,The place is awesome except for the lack of Restaurants and Starbucks closing so early where to go for a coffee or late night snack. Italy is great but there closed early. Maybe they should have put in a food court. The restaurants are pricey. They don't even have a buffet other then that bring back the old Monte Carlo.
50,This was our second time to stay at Park MGM and loved it. Clean rooms friendly staff and perfect location for us. The casino was just the right size and had my favorite table games. We enjoyed Primrose every morning for breakfast the bartenders make an awesome Irish coffee. Eataly is a great place for lunch with so much variety. La La Noodle was our next stop for dinner and it did not disappoint.
50,Fantastic service friendly staff great additions added to the hotel close to all major venues. Had great food in the walkway between New York New York and the Park at the beer house.Check in and the room was better than anticipated renovations to the room very well done.
50,The rooms have that Old Las Vegas feel even though they're all brand new. Italy was an amazing place to enjoy food with my son. The staff is really exceptional. The shops are expensive but nice. The tram is readily available.
20,"I would never stay here again! Our room although on the 14th floor was over a nightclub. On our first night there we were tired so we headed to our rooms early. We started hearing a loud boom sound and felt a deep bass vibration from the club. I immediately called the front desk. The woman had a very cavalier attitude and said that it should quiet down after midnight as they do not receive many complaints past that time. I'm assuming I was not the first to complain.    She sent up earplugs to my room. However these didn't help and in fact made the sound worse as it was more of the vibration that was bothersome. The noise did not stop until about 3AM.    The next morning we decided to speak to management. The woman we were spoke to was very rude to us. She never once apologized. She basically told us that ""it's Las Vegas and you're going to hear noise."" I explained we have been coming to Las Vegas for over 20 years and this was the first time we were bothered by a noise in our room.    We ended up switching to the Nomad which was a much better experience!    At the Park that the walls are very thin. I could hear the entire conversation the people next door were having and they were talking at a normal level.    There are no proper dressers in the rooms. There is a very tiny nightstand in the closet. The closet is also small so my husband and I had trouble fitting all of our clothes in there.    Everything feels very cheap in the rooms. At first glance it looks nice but when you start noticing the details of the decor (pillows fixtures carpet etc.) you realize it's very very cheap!    I bought a day pass to the spa when I was there. The day pass includes the steam room sauna and jacuzzi which is very small. In the sauna I could the music playing. But it wasn't soft spa music it was more of pop music. And the speakers were fuzzy. I was trying to relax in there but couldn't so I just took off. In most of the spas in Vegas you hear no music or tranquil spa music. That was very disappointing.    Would never stay here again!!"
50,We stayed at the MGM and went down for coffee and morning breakfast. They have sweets and savory options and both were very good. we stayed 4 days and we were there everyday! Lot of options to choose from.
10,Check in experience and customer service during my stay was very unsatisfactory.    I was invited to stay with a comp offer and reserved a King room (I thought it was guaranteed). I attempted to use the kiosk to check in at approximately 10 p.m. and received a message that my room was not ready. I inquired with the customer service agent assisting and she looked at her tablet and told me there weren't any kings available but she could put me in a Queen. When I explained my reservation type and that a King was confirmed she told me I would have to speak to a manager by waiting in the VIP line (there was a long que)...She was very unhelpful...so I waited in the Que and got to the front desk and was then told that in fact my room was ready. This was extremely frustrating and at least the agent did give me a food and beverage credit to accomodate me.    The next issue was with housekeeping upon cleaning my room housekeeping discarded of a plastic bag which contained three full bottles of premium tonic and a bottle of Hendrick's gin that had not been open(how they didn't feel the weight of the bag is a mystery to me)...I called down to explain to the front desk and their accomodation was to credit two days of my resort fees...    The next issue was with room service I ordered a turkey club with french fries and was told the wait would be 30 - 40 minutes. Within 20 minutes the room service was delivered and to my disappointment the french fries were cold and the sandwich poorly made. I immediately called down to inform room service and let them know of my dissatisfaction. The next morning I called to speak to the hotel manager and she offered to credit me my french fries only. I went on to explain to her at some length how I was completely dissatisfied with the meal and after a lengthy discussion she agreed to follow up with room service to confirm if the charge could be credited.    Just poor service all together.
50,Nothing negative to say about this hotel. I don't like big and impersonal hotels but that's my fault and not the hotel. I would stay again if I were ever to return to Vegas. Everything is automated so I didn't speak to any staff so cannot rate how polite and efficient they were.
40,Had a great time seeing Lady Gaga Jazz show at MGMPark . The venue was just inside casino. Nice and intimate. The hotel was nice and great pools. Liked the EATaly restaurants. Great Italian coffee and pastries. Fresh fish. Fun trip !
40,We loved the location the casino and the pool.    What we didn't like:  1. rooms had no dressers  2. poolside rooms are pretty loud in the afternoon with the pool music thumping    We often stay at MGM properties and love them! This one just wasn't doing it for us.    There literally are no places to put your clothes unless you hang them up or cram them in a tiny nightstand sized dresser.    I think the queen rooms actually have a largerish dresser.    If you're visiting for a short trip this is fine but we were there for 6 days and had clothes stacked on the couch and table.
50,First time in Las Vegas here's the perfect location quality services and staff good prices and amenities all processes easy to get done ... everything positive you cannot go wrong here. I'll be back here. Recommended!
50,This was our first time at Park MGM and we absolutely loved it and can't wait to go back! We really like the proximity to NYNY as that is one of our other favorite resorts. Eataly was a super experience.
50,Liked the location with a great variety of restaurant experiences nearby. Aria and the tram are within minutes. Not as crowded as other areas. Easy check in and check out. Walking distance to a few of the venues.
50,Had a great time pool was relaxing not to crowded. Location of the hotel is great walking distance to everything that is needed when taking a trip to Vegas. I will definitely be staying at this hotel again!!!
40,Went to see a concert at the Park Mgm and thought it would be convenient staying there as well. Neither of us had ever been there and we were pleasantly surprised. Checkin was fast received our rooms early and the front desk staff were friendly and helpful. Rooms are newly renovated the colour scheme is odd but they were clean and comfy! One downside was you can hear everything in the other rooms and I mean everything! Went to the pool and everything was clean and new and the staff were fast and friendly- food at the pool was really good. The concert was the Saturday night and again nothing but friendly helpful staff and the sound was really good would definitely attend another event at this venue. Wanted a cabana on Sunday but they were all booked months ago so we ended up going to another hotel and getting one. It was a fast quick trip and the hotel was way better than we expected and we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves.
40,Very clean. Modern. Close to amenities. Gym has lots of choices to choose from - never waiting. Starbucks on main floor but pricey. Coffee and Banana bread - $10USD. Walking distance to most resorts. $11 Uber to Freemont Street.    Preferred this resort over Rio. Much more modern and clean.
40,Went to Vegas to the Aerosmith concert and this hotel was connected to the Park Theater. The hotel rooms were comfortable clean and had great views. Not a luxury room but it serves the purpose for the time you spend in the room. Stayed on the 26th floor with a strip view. The beds and pillows are super comfortable baths looks redone.    The only downfall was I could hear the neighbors through the wall. It could be that they were just extra loud - One playing loud rap music but he stopped around 8pm. The other neighbor was just a loud woman who didn’t stop talking all night. Think she eventually went out but insisted on banging her door when she went in and out several times. But I guess that comes with all hotels.    The casino had the typical Vegas gaming. Didn’t see too many people winning. I lost it all there. More crowded at night. 3 pools and luckily one was adults only which is where we went.    Staff was friendly and helpful. Everyone complains about the check in / check out kiosks. I didn’t have trouble at all. We had 2 rooms. One was available when we arrived at noon. The other was ready at 3pm.    The hotel is pretty central to the south part of the strip: MGM New York New York Paris and Planet Hollywood. Next to the T-Mobile arena and Park Theater ... all within walking distance.    Will definitely stay there again if the deals are good.
30,The MGM Park hotel is average. Rooms are poorly/cheaply decorated. Had a bad experience checking in was ultimately billed 4x's on my credit card and had to call etc. to get bill corrected ( should have never had had to do this). When checking in on kiosk was treated rudely by staff which left a very unpleasant feeling for duration of stay. All that being said returning to Wynn/Encore for next visit. Sorry Park MGM lost my vote.
50,The Park MGM has become one of my favorite hotels to stay at. I travel frequently to Vegas for business and love the comfort of the rooms. The hotel has a variety of delicious restaurant options - Primrose is my favorite! Staff is friendly and helpful!
50,Things were great except the room air conditioner was broken and there was no dressers to put clothing into. There should also be a a coffee pot and microwave. Maid service need to come earlier in the a.m.
30,Mostly self check-in and checkout with computers. Clean and simple rooms fairly quiet (could be due to lack of neighbours?) And awesome sunsblocking blinds. Shower stall door does not close properly and has a large gap on the bottom causes pools of water in washroom needed a few towels to mop up the floor. Living area waste bin was half full of garbage from last occupant. Hotel staff often does not acknowledge guests in hallway or elevators. Overall a pleasant stay if compared to no non sense hotels but definitely not a 4 star hotel experience
50,Great hotel: very clean the casino doesn't smell of smoke the entertainment in the bars was outstanding. Aerosmith in the Park Theater is a fabulous concert and defiantly a must see. The Italian Eatery is amazing and the roast beef sandwich's were to die for.
40,We were in for a weekend to see Aerosmith (at the Park Theater) and Paul McCartney (at T-Mobile). The Park MGM location was perfect for our venues! We started out our mornings at Starbucks located which is on site. We also enjoyed La La Noodle (lobster and shrimp noodle dish) and the Eatery (Italian). And the Gelato in the Eatery was a perfect nightcap. The Casino here is nice the only complaint was the music was a little loud.
50,The room remodeling has done wonders for this resort as well as the addition of Eataly and La La Noodle. These are legit dining options now. We haven't stayed here since the tail end of the Monte Carlo but it's nice to see there's been significant improvements during that time.
40,This was a great choice of hotels for attending the Paul McCartney Concert at the T-Mobile Arena. Right across the street from the arena. Easy access great restaurants and casino. Excellent service overall.
50,Great property great location close to major properties. Steps from the new T-Mobile arena airport and major landmarks. The room was modern an super clean. The staff was super friendly and the pool area was extremely nice.
10,"I had the WORST experience at the Park MGM and ended up leaving the hotel to go stay at the Mirage. Besides having almost claustrophobically small rooms their ""remodel"" has the rooms reconfigured so that the head of the bed is in a little ""cubby hole"" area facing the window. The window is totally blocked by a long couch so if you wanted to sit by the window you can't. The TV is on the wall to the right so you have to turn your head to see it. There is this ugly metal thing covering the wires under the TV which were still hanging out of the bottom. A weird small dining room table is sitting in the middle of the room. No desk. No dresser. The bathroom door is also the closet door - slide it one way to close the closet then the other way to close the bathroom. There is a small two-drawer thing in the small closet that you are supposed to put stuff in. Shower is clean and redone but you can't turn on the water to adjust the temperature then walk in because the door faces inwards and the water sprays all over the bathroom floor as it bounces off the door. And the bed was really poor quality. I couldn't take it and went downstairs to talk to the Manager on Duty who quickly dismissed me to the VIP desk. Obviously my concerns were not very important to him; he was talking to a friend and didn't want to spend any time with me. I wqs explaining everything and when we got to the couch part she said if I wanted to look out the window I could kneel on it and look out! I said I'm not going to kneel and look out the window. That is just crazy! I was shown another room which was supposedly an upgraded room but it was just as bad. I was told I could get a better room for another $60-$70 a night and declined saying I should not have to be paying more for another room when I am so unhappy with this one. I called the Mirage where I have stayed many times before and explained the situation. They were able to accommodate me for a slightly higher rate and it was well worth it. I'll never stay at Park MGM again - EVER! It might be close to T-Mobile but I'd rather have a nicer bigger room with a comfortable bed. So disappointed in this hotel. Nice casino lousy rooms."
40,Excellent concept - really fresh food  cooked to order  buffet idea but brilliantly done. Forget the formality of a white linen restaurant relaxed cafe style ideal for the family  of all ages. We stopped after the GAGA concert and we were right on closing but the dining area did accommodate . Good stop at the end of the strip !
50,One of the best places to stay in Vegas! This was my first time to stay and it has everything you need- casino with high energy comfortable quiet rooms easy access to the strip and GREAT pools. This is my new 'go-to' hotel in Vegas!
30,Might get a good room rate but prepare yourself to get gouged from start to finish. $15 a day for parking food drinks and water are stupid expensive. Restaurants are few and crowded. The pool area... Meh.
30,Checking in the hotel was confusing and frustrating. They tried to tell us our reserved king room was sold out and we had to pay to upgrade to a different room if we wanted to. Later this was resolved by the VIP desk. There was no one there that greeted us or explained the amenities of the hotel or the surrounding attractions. The rooms were clean but the staff was not that helpful
30,The rooms need a “hefty” upgrade. The beige indoor/outdoor looking carpet and red couch looks from 1980. Drinks and food are both over priced but there is plenty of options across the street and in the area
50,Stayed at the Park MGM with a friend for the Aerosmith concert! Very convenient. The staff and facilities were very nice. Room was clean and comfortable. Jemaa NoMad pool party was amazing! Great restaurant and lounge options.
20,For $250 a night not worth it. Although resort and room were OK & close to the concert venue we went there for we would not recommend. Clogged toilet & couldn't reach anybody on the phone after 2 calls to 2 different depts and almost 10 min on hold. Had to go hunt somebody down. No coffee pot or alarm clock in room Pool closed at 8 pm in June are you kidding me? AC unit was loud as hell and when that wasn't running loudly the dogs barking & base booming from nearby room were going. We requested a quiet room. Also paid extra for strip view that was very obscured by rooftops. Aerosmith concert was great however
10,They charge $15 per day to self park or $24 per day to valet even hotel guests.    You check yourself in via a kiosk vs. a smiling friendly face.    The rooms are red and noisy and our sheets had blood on them. BLOOD that had NOT been through a washer.    There are no in-room amenities and Starbucks does not staff appropriately in the morning.    The slot play was way too tight. You couldn't even sit long enough at a machine to get a drink.    My expectations were much higher for an MGM property Las Vegas strip hotel.
30,The hotel seemed old and dirty areas with trash on the floor. The casino is small and it's hard to sleep as the walls are thin. The staff and service was okay. At the beginning I had issues with our room and they did not want to give me a bed with king bed.. after some time the representative was able to locate a room with a king bed which I thought was very weird being that she said they did not have any. She was friendly and waived one night of resort fee and gave us 10 dollars for food which was nice of her. Overall and considering we did not spend much time at the hotel our stay was average. I was not impressed with the hotel but it was fine for the time we were actually there.
50,The remodeled rooms are very nice. The curtains keep the room so dark that me and my wife slept in later than normal. We had to make ourselves get up;. Very comfy bed too. The bathroom is spacious and looks like something you would find in an expensive resort.
40,Although our first room was a mess & the second room had minor issue (safe needed resetting phone was unplugged at Jack) we had a great stay at PArk MGM. Nothing is inexpensive but relative to Vegas lifestyle. Eataly is an experience. Manzo very good as well as Primrose for breakfast. Delightful garden feel dining. The theater right on sight makes seeing a show very convenient!
10,Self check in process with little to no Guest Services when you run into problem with the computers or printers. Dark hallways. Small rooms (think Comfort Inn or smaller and less quality). No storage. No desk. Set air conditioner on lowest setting of 65 and still hot.
50,Stayed here because of the Aerosmith concert at the Park Theater. Read some of the reviews and was a bit nervous. This hotel is great! Check in and out was a breeze. No line. No wait. Help at the self service kiosk if you have questions was readily available.  Room was King Strip View. Nice normal sized room. Very clean. Great view day and night with a Ben h at the wi cow.  Pool was very nice and clean. Ample chairs and umbrellas. Def would stay here again!
30,Great Personal Staff always willing to help when asked questions.  The room (2 Queen beds/pool view) on the other hand was very questionable. Dirty spotted carpet stains around table no fan in bathroom and beds...hmmm. Felt like I was sleeping inverted because mattresses are not turned around from the sag on side by shared night stand.
10,Room was not ready even i have make reservation long time before im arriving at that date and i have to got king bed instead i order 2 queen bed  and also have wait to got that rooom aswell  if we dont do any reservation im understand we have take what they got  bad exp for first time to try this hotel
50,Super comfy beds quiet room excellent location! Loved the parking garage and restaurants nearby. Easy access to TMobile Arena! First time in Vegas and will definitely stay there again- hopefully soon!
40,Could be my last but very easy connect walk to ARIA and tram to Bellagio  Rooms were ok and nice  but could not get to cool down. Stay away from poolside view if you plan on taking a nap there is loud boom boom music and you wound be able to sleep.
20,Club was VERY load until 2 am if you like Bass when you sleep your in luck we were on 25th floor called front desk offered to move us at midnight but our friends on 27th heard it as well. Check bill carefully asked about late checkout and the charge was $20 until 1 pm so we said forget it then it was on bill. Aerosmith was awesome and venue was good and connected. no way I would go back
20,Terrible check in terrible room. Would not stay here again. Went to a show at the park theater. It was convenient entry into the theater. Other than that rooms were very outdated. Air conditioning wasn’t able to keep room cool even though it ran constantly. On 72.
50,Park MGM is a great place to stay. Location is the best within walking distance of many great hotels and casinos. The check in on June 24 was horrible. Check in is usually 3:00 pm. I requested an early check in and if available might have received it. I didn't pay for early check in so I can't complain about that. I can complain that with the normal 3:00 pm we didn't get in our room until after 5:00 pm. That was very frustrating waiting around for a room. Also when they started assigning the rooms they put everyone on the floors using the same elevators. There was a line that went on forever. Other than that the Park MGM is a great place and I will most likely return.
30,We were given 3 reduced rates for this hotel and I was very disappointed. First the rooms were nicely redone but there are no dressers to put your clothes in. We stayed 3 nights and had to live out of our suitcases. The resturants were all upscaled and pricey. Not everyone likes expensive Italian food. The pool wasclean. The staff was friendly and curtious. Not slot of tables opened until 8 pm. I would not stay again. Went over to NY NY for a better food selection.
40,It was good! Location was great. But there is a door in a room connecting next room. It’s so noisy. Can hear everything single words. But we didn’t care.  View was not bad. Size was pretty good. Oh there was no refrigerator. T-T you should bring water.
20,My first opinion was that the Casino was smokier then others. Then they don't have a real front desk more of a Self Service Kiosk station I think personal service matters.    We get to our room and the cord for the blinds is broken there was hair and big dust balls on the floor of the restroom.... AND POOP splattered on the toilet seat and rim. So gross. First impressions matter and this one was not good. I spoke to the manager and she made it right she switched our room and gave us a $50 food/beverage credit- which she didn't have to do.    They are still transitioning from Monte Carlo and I think they have alot of kinks to work out still.    OH And our main reason for booking this hotel was the pools and lazy river for the kids---- Well the lazy river was removed and their pools are nothing to write home about. They have 3 pools but they aren't very big.
10,We were 2 couples.  First we got 2rooms at the same flor.  In my room I saw a scratch on the window. and I reported it to the reception. When I came back from the swimming pool the keys didn't opened the door.  I changed the keys 3!! TIME but it didn't work. Only at the 4th time they told us that they closed the room and they wanted us to move to an other room. I had tix to a show so they sent us a security man that opened the door and let us changed clothes.after the show we had to explain the story again to the reception and they sent another security person to open the door.We had to pack again our baggage and to take it to the new room by ourselves. THEY DIDT SEND EVEN A BELL BOY TO HELP US!!.  The new room was 12 floor downat the and of the corridor not with our frands.A REAL DOWNGRADE!  When we talk to the reception and told them that we are very disappointed they have the courage to tell us that there is a security investigation and may be it was us that made the damage on the window.(AND THAT IS AFTER THE ROOM MADE MANAGER TALD US THAT SHE KNOE ABAUT THAT)  Tha room decoration is old and ugly.  The maintenance is horrible. (The water in the bathroom stays)  And the cleaning in the corridor was bad  We wanted to make a self checkout at 4:00 o'clock and we asked for waickup call at 3:00 but as I suspected nobody call.us  The auto checkout didn't workedwe want to the reception to make checkout.The couldn't have us a recite do the fact that the computer didn't work.  When I got the recite by mail I saw that they charged me 3 times for valet parking (AND I DIDN'T HAD A CAR)  I wrote them an email and they refund me the money for the parking.  I travel a lot! Usually I don't write bad reviews but this hotel was very badwith really ugly treatment. There are a lot of opportunities in LA so avoid this one
10,We didn't believe all the reviews before booking but all of them are really true when it co.es to the room. Dont risk your vacation to save a handful of cash. Book another hotel.  Very small rooms ac truly doesnt work in any of the rooms nust as all the reviews say. TV didnt work. They sent someone to fix it at 2 an. After 30 mins same issue again. Gave us a new room went to that room there was cleaning crew still working on it. Went down the lobby and they gave us another room. The safe in this.new room didnt work.    I know hotel eoom cost is cheap but it is still really not worth it if you cant sleep in it at all.
50,Excellent place to stay. Friendly staff members. Love the location.  Close to many entertainment venues. Has good choices for dining.  The pool area is very nice. Casino has lot of gambling options.  I recommend Park MGM .
10,I go to Vegas 2-3 times a year for over 20 years. I’ve stayed at other MGM properties and have enjoyed them. I was looking forward to my stay at the Park MGM for the first time. They were offering some complementary nights so I thought “hey perfect. I’m gonna be seeing a concert at the Team Mobile Arena so it’s gonna be convenient.” It is. But...be aware there is a night club down stairs. I asked to be on a lower floor I don’t like heights 1st night I kept waking up cause of the sound of the base in my room. I asked to be moved. The girl Arleen at the front was very helpful. Moved me to another wing. 2nd & 3rd day I could hear the pool party I was informed it happens every weekend louder than my TV. My husband had a decibel reader on his phone. It was reading at 60-80dbl. in the room! I called the front desk and he told me they were aware... but it ends at 6:00pm. I wanted to take a cat nap before going to the concert and staying up til 2:00-4:00am!!!    I’ve read some of the other good and bad reviews. They all have their points. Yes hard to get to no drawers dark halls very limited closet space uncomfortable furniture higher Strip table min. Hidden room tax and resort fees. Good if you want to be right where the action is lots of bars nightclubs loud music live like a Baller ect...    I won’t be back! MGM is loosing my respect and probably most of my business too. I’ll be off the Strip pay for my room and be an older happy camper next time.
10,No coffee in room. Drinks were too expensive. Room too expensive. Money grab! No fridge or microwave in room. I had to leave room to stand in line to pay $4 for a coffee. 2 drinks at pool was $35. Money grab to the maxxx i will stay anywhere else next time.
40,I stayed at Park MGM for a business conference across the street as the other hotel was more expensive. Next time would stay at an airbnb as I find casino hotels too noisy. Although my room was quiet for the most part and very nice.
50,Park MGM is a GEM on the strip. This was my second visit this year. I spent 5 wonderful nights here. We came for a GAGA week where we saw two of the Enigma showsHer Jazz and Piano and Brian Newmans show. It was a perfect week and Park MGM is the perfect place to stay. Rooms are nice and clean the housekeeping staff are fabulous and do such an incredible job. The hotel is always clean. There are so many great restaurants we went back to Eataly and Best Friend this time around. We will be back in October for another Gaga week and we want to try Bavette's. It's easy access to Bellagio Aria and NYNY. Staff is always helpful and ready to assist Haus of Gaga is located right in the casino and great way to spend some time and to give Gaga more of your money. I am very much looking forward to returning in October. This is my go to hotel in vegas!
50,Traveled to Las Vegas to attend Aerosmith concert. Chose the hotel since the theater was in the hotel. Made a great choice. Great rates Friendly and helpful staff. Beautiful roomsartworkrestaurantsand 3 pools!
20,...in a town like Las Vegas with lots of great places to stay this one falls short. We decided to stay here as a group on an annual Vegas trip it was newly renovated and looked to have some great amenities. The amenities are very good great places to eat and drink and the staff at check the pool deck and restaurants were exceptionally accommodating. The resort itself was very lacking in both set up and service. The rooms have none of the amenities you would expect from a Vegas hotel nowhere to place you items and a large table is out of place in the rooms. The room staffing was terrible we had to ask to replace shampoo and soap daily and it still wasn’t done broken safe was never repaired in the 4 days we were there. My wife and I have to resort to CVS next door to replace some of the amenities in our room. Very poor. In this town there are better places to spend your money. They’ve missed the hospitality aspect here.
40,Very nice hotel. Clean rooms friendly staff. Stay Well suites are amazing but did not care for the beds. A little too firm for my liking. Everything else was fantastic. Best shower heads! Good location on the Strip. Parking was a bit of a hassle of you did not know where to go but only because of all the construction going on
10,First day we arrived you have to check yourself in on these touch screen computers (they have a few helpers to help you figure it out) then we had difficulty with the key cards not working had to use the elevator to go down 23 floors to get the key cards working this happened twice during the week. When we first went into the room there was a large carry out food bag with 30 packets of condiments sitting on a chair. There was trash in the bathroom trash can. (I have pictures of both). They had a small refrigerator they should have a microwave in all their rooms.Their restaurants are way over priced. And I have had an M life Rewards card for years. I had my laptop with me and I couldn't sign in or anything. It said I had to call a long distance number sorry I don't have time for that I'm on vacation. And the MGM Resorts app is useless.The only good thing all week was the Aerosmith concert. Then they charge you a $41.95 a day Resort Fee and Tax for a Grand Total of $167.80. Sorry but I had a much better time the last time I was in Vegas at the old Gold Spike they even had a free breakfast every morning.
40,Pros: Park theme was well presented and harmonized. We had cocktails in a little garden under the tree shade near the pool and it was terrific. Self check in and out is very simple and no line. I got a room at check in around noon. Did not expect that King bed with city view from floor 18 was great. Spacious room with a sofa and club chair by the window. Furniture and fixture were high quality. Bathroom was well kept. The best shower pressure. Especially the modern make up mirror was so clear that I must shop for the same one. Extremely clean. Self parking is very convenient short walk to hotel. Parking lot is much cleaner than Paris.    Cons: Hotel section presented in the lower end. Dark hall way and subdue wall paper design. Bed room carpet was plain and more of office type tan color. I was a bit surprise about this factor because it brought the casino atmosphere down significantly. I hope this room is in the middle of the renovation. No mini frig which is very rare in Vegas hotels. The wall was thin liked the other reviews. My neighbor was on the business call for a long time that I could listen to the whole topic. I got a bit annoying about it because I got back to my room for a quick nap. The interior design was a bit off that the TV mounted parallel to the bed. Parking fees was $15 a day.  Bottom line is Vegas Hotels price themself very well. This hotel offered a decent quality per a decent fee. 3.5 star is just about right for its appearance
50,....they are belonging to the old Monte Carlo Hotel.  Park MGM is new renovated and modern. Rooms are big and cozy.  Casino is not as big as the big player in Vegas- but if you like it more familiar- that could be your spot.  I will definitely return.
40,As good as it gets location-wise in the heart of the Las Vegas Strip connected to Park Theater (Aerosmith Bruno Mars Lady Gaga all in resdency at different times) and next to T-Mobile Arena (concerts and Vegas Golden Knights hockey). Great restaurants and entertainment at your fingertips. Newly renovated rooms could use coffee makers and mini-fridges but the price is generally right that you can live without them.
30,I go to Vegas a lot. I love it there. I prefer a higher-end hotel but stayed at Park MGM because we had a concern at T-Mobile Arena. We were provided with a suite which was OK but still had thin windows and thin toilet paper. Just because the room is larger doesn't make it better! Check-in wasn't great - no VIP service as expected and customary at MGM properties. Overall this is a revamped hotel that you can tell is old with a fresh coat of paint. It's great for what it is - good location cheaper price point. But it's no Bellagio or Wynn which is what I have grown accustomed to.
20,Its a shame but all i wanted was a higher floor and they couldnt even give me that and not one person wished me a happy bday even wearing my bday boy shirt. They ppl didnt smile the entire time i talked to staff.
50,My stay was from Sunday to Thursday & the hotel experience couldn't have been better. The room was nice. The housekeeping staff was excellent along with the bell desk & concierge staff. Definitely go on the Wednesday art tour.
10,Our rooms were booked way in advance. We arrived at 12 am and didnt get a room until 2 am. I requested a king bed and was given a queen MURPHY BED!. The bed was in the upward position and locked. We waited an hour and it took 2 employees to finally unlock it. My head hit the pillow at 3:30 am. We checked out a day later... Did I mention there was a used q-tip mixed with the clean ones?? Disgusting!
40,I have stayed at The Park now twice and both times great experience. I was looking for a reasonable rate in a central location and The Park had both. Their rooms are very nicely arranged clean and decorated great. Loved that it was in a central location to walk everywhere. Right next to NY NY and across from MGM Grand. Shopping was nearby. At the time I stayed they did not have their own buffet so we would go to the Aria which was connected. We did eat at the restaurant that was open in The Park and it was very nice good food. Pool area was very nice but not as nice as some of the upper scale hotels. I really enjoyed my time. Cleaning staff were super friendly. i would continue to go back.
50,The hotel was great. It was a big change from what it used to be. The location was perfect for where we wanted to be. I was very happy with everyone being professional with me and my wife. We look forward to our next trip to Las Vegas. Thank you
40,I paid for an upgrade on my room to have view to the strip and this room does not have the little refrigerator. Their system naver had my room and did not let me make the upgrade by my self. The employee at the check in area was unable to help me insted he aske me to wait 2 hours to finnaly tell me to go to the VIP desk to solve my problem besides the lady from this VIP area also told me that my room was not ready after more then 2 hours of wait She only helped me getting my upgraded room.
20,The casino didn’t offer much in slot play and my wife and I struggled to find slot machines we liked. My wife knows I always like to go and sit at the sports books area and it wasn’t until day two that we finally found it. The lack of restaurants didn’t help and we settled for CVS drug store next store as their “Eatily” section closed early and had limited things to eat. I will not be going back to this place.
10,My room wasn’t ready when I arrived at 11 pm- 12 hours after check out. No excuse for that. Heard that from others also but they had booked through Expedia -so I do understand that -but that doesn’t make it right The safe in my room was locked even after I reported it. There is no buffet and the restaurants I ate in were not good. It’s hard to navigate the hotel finally found the walk way to Aria and found the front door by walking in from the outside.
30,There was no coffee pot nor refrigeration options in the room. This forces patrons to spend ridiculous amounts of money on property or to walk to Walgreens or CVS to purchase items at a more reasonable price.
50,Thank you so much.the place is really wonderful.i really love love love love the Park MGM.love to comeback again with my friend and tell it to some of my friends.thank you so much for having me in your wonderful place.i enjoy my stay.
50,Other than having to go outside to warm up casino was great. Bed was super comfortable. I did buy a cheap cooler at Walmart to keep drinks in ice. I will for sure return to Park MGM. Wonderful solo trip.
40,Difficult for sleeping at night where we were due to loud bass. Check in without people is difficult. Everyone was having issues with it and there was no room ready when we arrived. Pools are very nice and pool serving staff are very attentive.
20,No room was available for early check in . We made our reservations 6 months in advance. There are no dressers in the room. No place to put your clothes. 2 small drawers in the closet is all you get for 2 guests. No coffeee maker in the room. The decor was not appealing. The Halls are dark and dreary.
30,The rooms smell like smoke when sleeping  air conditioner didt work wel. Overall was okay probably wouldt stay there again. the bathroom vents didt work or didt haveone room got all condensation. when showering
30,Noise level between rooms is to much no fridge no clock loud hallways. Pool area is nice and relaxed. Music needs changed to much hip hop. Casino is Smoky Italian eatery is top notch other restaurants are average at best.
50,Enjoyed two nights at the Park MGM and would consider staying here again. Good location and Eataly is a great amenity. All of the staff was helpful and pleasant to deal with. The room was very clean and spacious.
50,This was a pleasure trip and our first to the Park MGM since their upgrade. Early check-in to the room was a real bonus and the bed was the most comfortable hotel bed I have experienced.  Service was great.
10,Don’t stay here if you have a handicap elderly or have dark skin. 1) Room was very cold even w/o turning on the air cond. I get cold easily. I have fibromyalgia which causes you to have aches and pains at cold temps etc. You can not control the heat in your room. The building controls your ability to use heat in your room. In the summer they cut the heat function off so you can’t use it if you needed to. I was freezing and hurting. I called and they sent a tech up who didn’t do anything but text while he was in my room then said he can’t do anything about it the temp doesn’t go any higher. I knew that was a lie cause my son is a Electrical Eng and told me they just have to cut it on but don’t want to cause of the season. So I called them back crying asking them to send me to another hotel if they have something against me because being in pain and freezing was ruining my vacation. They sent another tech and he walked in the room for 10 sec and turned a knob and the heat started blowing. The first tech was told not to do it via text. 2) Only sheets on the bed I asked for blankets. They said they would bring them and never did. 3) My husband took a glass drink to the pool and was stopped and told he couldn’t do it. But people that didn’t look like me was walking back and forth with glass drinks all day. I told them I didn’t appreciate the treatment I was getting. They offered a bunch of perks to make it right but the damage was done. Based on how we were treated we may have a discrimination case against this hotel. It was that bad. I would NEVER stay here again.
50,Very friendly staff. Very comfortable room. Very clean environment. Loved the beds extremely comfortable. We chose this location because we were attending a concert located there. Loved the experience.
30,No coffee in the room which for the resort fee should be included. Had to get dressed go downstairs and stand in line for an hour to get a cup of coffee. The bed and room were great just would have been nice to relax with a cup of coffee in the morning.
50,Had a great time at Park mgm rooms were clean and nice. With great views pools were clean and nice restaurants are everywhere nice music playing in the lobby bell service was super nice and helped us out from check in to check out I will be traveling again in a few weeks and plan on staying here again in july
20,We have stayed at many MGM properties. The Park MGM was definitely not what we expected!    We arrived to drop our bags change and leave for our dinner reservation. Valet charged us $24 for less than one hour for us to check in change clothes and leave.  When we did scan our ticket to get the car they couldn’t find it. We saw it they had moved it 15 feet from when we arrived so we pointed to it (after waiting about 15 minutes) the valet said it was a mix up. We self parked when we got back that night and were charged another $15. Total $39 for the first night just to park our car.    Room was small but that was okay. We needed to iron a shirt but there was no iron in the room. We called to get an iron. When the man arrived he asked what was wrong with the one in the room. We said we didn’t have one he acted as though we were lying but gave us an iron.    The shower had good water pressure but no seal under the glass so when we used the shower the water went under the glass and all over the floor. After almost slipping on the wet tile it took 3 towels to clean up the water. The shower head also leaked (looked like someone tried to fix it) so it sprayed the ceiling and the paint was bubbled damp and hanging down. The bathroom sink and toilet also had dark dirt rings in them.    We faced the pool but the windows were filthy. The red couch in front of the window had some white stains on it don’t want to guess what that was.    It was over 100 degrees while we were there and since the room only had one vent it never cooled off during our stay. Just inside the door there were two hooks on the wall one was damaged and falling off the wall.    When trying to go downstairs the next day 3 of the 6 elevators were out of order. It took us almost 30 minutes to get downstairs. When we did there was a line of at least 50 people waiting in line to try to go upstairs.    Overall between parking fees taxes room rate and resort fees we spent almost $300 for 2 nights NOT WORTH IT! Save your money and go somewhere else.
40,The room and beds were comfortable. Very quiet at night so you can get a sound sleep. I loved the Juniper Cocktail Lounge and the service there was very friendly. Make sure that if you stay here that you like the color green. It does feel like you are in a park in London at times. I was a fan.
30,The location is great. Walk to many different spots or catch the tram to head up the strip. Just a couple minutes to New York New York which is where we spent much of our time.    The room: the room itself was fine. The beds were clearly old very soft and not supportive. The walls are thin we overheard an entire conversation in the room next door and could hear them sneeze and other sounds. I felt bad for them as there are serious snorers in our family. As others said we would have appreciated a mini fridge to keep our waters cold and a coffee maker in the room - only one Starbucks downstairs always with a long line.    On-site dining: Eataly was delicious but pricey. There is no family restaurant on the premises the closest thing to one was very expensive. This is why we spent so much time at New York New York they have a much better selection of restaurants and better prices.    Amenities: my two boys love swimming but they had no desire to try the pools here. They would have loved a lazy river or water slide instead the pools all had a party atmosphere not welcoming to teens. Yes it’s Vegas but it would be nice to have one pool option to play in.    In summary if you are traveling with adults this is a better choice than if you are traveling with teens. The boutique atmosphere is nice the service was always fast and friendly. Not a fan of the self check-in kiosks and the $40 resort fee doesn’t include parking or in-room coffee or a fridge...
40,Room was great . Nice layout comfortable beds  nice pillows. Didn't hear other guests in hallways only a little shower noise in the morning. My only complaint was that room was not available on time. Perhaps the hotel could offer beverages/snack for our inconvenience. Staff was very pleasant and helpful. Park Theater is a great venue for concerts. Will stay again.
30,Location was fine  No information on things to do - None  No information on where to eat / Prices  No infomation on how to get around  If you have a lot of extra money to throw away  this is your place...ask questions do a lot of homework cause you are on your own
20,I miss the Monte Carlo that I loved and enjoyed. It’s like Park MGM is trying to be something they are not. We are not very likely to stay here in the future. All the staff were great. Bring back the staff for check-in.
20,Very disappointed scores were based on the room. The wellness room was just a giant let down and we hate to feel this way but it was just our experience. The casino and pool great and the lobby was amazingly clean and wonderful.
50,Nothing to say bad about this hotel 👍👍👍 we will come back in the future. Hopefully next time hotel will have black jack switch more hours for paigow face up. Also more lot machines Starbucks coffee need to open another place in the casino.
50,We were visiting to see Aerosmith for my 37th time.We were happy it was at this venue since all the services food and the Jemma pool was outstanding. We will be back at the Park in Sept to the band again.
50,I loved this hotel. Great location within walking distance to everything. Etaly the onsite Italian eatery offered some excellent options especially the desserts. Saw a show while there and loved that we could go right to room after.
30,The staff was pleasant the rooms were clean the pool has nice options. We had a nice time. I just feel that for the price paid for every snack drink and meal I would have loved the option to take things back to my room and refrigerate and reheat. I felt that the drinks at the pool and snacks are wayyyyyy overpriced.
50,Had the best weekend at Park MGM. From the great room fresh casino lux spa and my favorite Eataly...it was joyous and expansive time! We've found our next hotel -- we won't stay anywhere else ever again! Can't wait to go back.
40,Room was adequate. Had vegas strip view that was further away than most hotels. TV was not working. Waited 45 minutes for maintenance to address. Pillows were too stiff. Had a rough first night sleeping. Pool was great casino was great! Best Friend restaurant was one of the best places to eat.
50,Hotel was recently updated and I love the layout. The restaurants provided top notch service and excellent food. I love the Park Casino because it is small and not overcrowded. Also I always had a drink in my hand! I will be returning soon!
50,Check in was great  Room was the best ( suite) staff was very willing to help with all our silly questions. Pool was great before it got too hot. food was great ! over all a great place to stay the location is pretty close to everthing you want to see in vegas . walked 3 to 5 miles every day to the attractions we want to see. They treat veterans with special care and discounts.
40,So convenient to T-Mobile arena! Our room had a nice view comfortable beds and a great shower! Amazing water pressure and HOT water... no wondering if all the soap is out of your hair no spurts of cold water. The only thing I’d change is that I’d try to be a little further away from the elevator. Too many drunk loud inconsiderate people late at night yelling in the hallways.
50,Amazing hotel.....the Eataly Food Court is wonderful! This place has a great atmosphere and so many options and new things to try. The location of the hotel is centrally located and everything is easily within walking distance. The Park Theater is an awesome theater without a bad seat in the house! First time staying here is it was a wonderful experience!
20,Three nights at Park MGM were too long...three nights in Vegas were too long. The only reason we stayed here was to see Aerosmith. Never Again. A disappointment. Hotel was meh!    No personal check in--check in kiosks didn't work.    Room was very small. No coffee tea refrigerator. Central Air was poor no ventilation in the bathroom sink slow to drain. Windows covered with fingerprints . No chest of drawers. Odd closet/bathroom door function. 5 hangers. No place for clothes. Walls paper thin. Can feel and hear reverberation from T-Mobile stadium.    Not enough umbrellas by the crowded pool. Pool wait service was poor. Pool side vomiting.    Too smokey in casino.    Charge for late check out-seriously?    Plus: Comfy bed. Eataly was a plus. The bartenders at the center casino bar were friendly and attentive. The maid for our room was super sweet and attentive. DJ played Aerosmith poolside. Weather cooperated to our  liking.
10,The guest rooms were disappointing. We are platinum Mlife guests who always stay at the Bellagio. We have received numerous offers to stay at the Park and booked one of those offers. I was extremely disappointed in the minimalist room quality. There are two tiny dresser doors in the closet that barely can accommodate one person let alone a couple. There are no drawers by the nightstand. The bathroom has similar issues as well as lacked robes. As platinum guests I expected a higher standard.
10,I frequent Vegas often. This was the worst stay I had. Everything I experienced aside from the Starbucks was substandard. MGM Grand Mandalay or even Luxor would be a better option if you want this area of the strip and want an Mlife property.
40,The Park MGM is a nice upscale hotel. It's price point is pretty high and I felt that it was geared towards younger people who are there to party and spend money. During the day the lobby is was packed with people in bathing suits or dressed for golf. At night everyone was dressed for clubbing and drinking. It is right next door to the T-Mobile Arena so super convenient if you are attending an event there. Our main complaint was that our room was directly above the party pool with the DJ. Our room was pulsating with bass all day long so if you are looking for a place to relax sleep in and have peace and quiet make sure you request a room away from the party pool. We also felt that there wasn't much to do inside the hotel beyond gambling. There ARE restaurants but they are limited and there was nothing at all to eat there at midnight on Saturday night after two big concerts let out. The food they do have is on the high end price-wise. Even our regular Starbucks order cost 25% more than it normally would. For the $40 per night resort fee there wasn't enough regular stuff. No mini-bar. We didn't even see an ice bucket or ice machine. I've stayed at nicer better hotels in Las Vegas. I wouldn't NOT recommend staying at the Park MGM but it would not be my go-to spot in the future.
40,"This is a right-sized hotel that is perfect if you are seeing a show at the Park MGM. The hotel rooms are easily and quickly accessible from the lobby without a lot of walking The pool area is clean relatively quiet and intimate. The Primrose was a lovely restaurant worth the expense. The lines at the Starbucks were always long but the staff was very friendly. Eataly was a bit pricey but very convenient for grabbing a sandwich and salad for a relaxing lunch in your room. The casino area was surprisingly pleasant for me and my ""limited gambling"" friends. We ended up having a lot of fun more than doubling our money in the 2 hours we spent on the casino floor. The operation was well run and the staff was friendly helpful and efficient."
10,The only thing that’s good about this place is their comfy bed! You self check-in and self check out. No fridge no drinking water! I will never stay at this place again! Resort fees are standard in Vegas BUT the lack of drinking water in the room whether paid or not made me feel bitter about the resort fee. You are better of staying at places like Stratosphere. Not really an upgrade from the old Monte Carlo.    Stay away from this place. PARK MGM DO NOT NOT CARE ABOUT YOU! They just want to take your money and you are on your own!
50,The MGM did a great job remodeling. The check in was computerized and easy. All rooms and hot were recently redone with an Italian modern theme. Rooms were nice but not much drawer s[pace per my wife. The Eatily was terrific but pricey.
20,Eataly was the best thing about this hotel. Next time I'll visit Eataly but would reconsider staying on property. Our first experience at the Park MGM with the check in set the tone for our stay. Prior to your check in date they send you options to upgrade your room and stay. We decided that we wanted to try a stay-well room and received an email confirmation of our upgrade. When we checked in at the kiosk and got to our room I realized that the amenities described of the stay well room were not included in our room. I called the front desk asking if it was a stay well room. The front desk representative informed me that I was not in fact in a stay well room as I was on the 13th floor and all the stay well rooms are on a different floor. She had me transferred to someone in another department and after explaining my situation for the second time to someone else he said he had to transfer me to someone at the front desk. I told him that I was just transferred from the front desk and he said that he could not help me and I was patched through again to someone at the front desk who told me that I would have to go downstairs. After going downstairs and explaining myself for the 4th time I was then directed to someone at the VIP desk who asked me to go back upstairs to collect my things from the room and get re-assigned a room. After being bounced around to 5 different people and without any compassion from any of them we were very frustrated and just opted to keep our original room. It was so much effort and work on our part to solve the problem and mistake that they made. We understand that mistakes happen and were understanding until we received no compassion from the staff and no one offered any help or solutions. They pretty much just focused on revamping the outside of the hotel in the Monte Carlo to Park MGM switch and maybe it was just our room I doubt that but it was just very basic and needed updating and a good vacuuming to the carpet. The AC wasn't cold and the bed was terrible.
20,Check-in Check-out process from hell at this property. They couldn’t provide a king bed at 10:30 PM. I had to wait at VIP counter. They gentleman at the counter said he would remove the resort fees. Smoky room at this non-smoking room. Basically they painted the old Monte Carlo. At checkout through their mobile application resort fees were still on. Had to wait in line again at VIP counter. Gentlemen had no record of problem at check in. Make sure you take names if they make promises.
40,Please accept my apologies. When I arrived in LA there's some problem with my lips I can only do the appointment yesterday. Your hotel reception room attendants are good. The room attendants clean everything reception staff is friendly and courteous.  Thank you very much!!!
40,"Decided to go to Las Vegas to spend some time with 2 of my brothers. The room was booked through Hotwire and was at a very competitive rate. Park MGM is located right on the strip and is near a number of places to dine etc.    I'm not a gambler so I cannot comment on the casino except to say it looked like all the rest I saw. If you prefer to pay the ""Nevada State Tax"" while in Vegas I expect this casino would be fine.    The room was very spartan and plain. No chest of drawers for clothes. However it was immaculate and clean and very fresh. The tidiness of the room deserves emphasis. I'm not sure I can recall a hotel room this nice and tidy. For a hotel on the strip it was quiet at night.    The room had a wall safe large nice bathroom and flat screen TV. Staff was very pleasant and check in was a breeze. All in all a very nice stay and I would gladly stay here again."
20,For a newly remodeled property I was disappointed. Seems like the beds were recycled from the prior Monte Carlo. Lumpy and soft. Also the MLife program is deceptive. It’s impossible to see your benefits. After digging it seems you earn one penny for each dollar of gambling. So if you gamble $1000 you get $10 in free play. Hardly a program to engender substantial loyalty. Had a steak at Bavetts. Nice venue but was super salty.
50,The Park MGM offers great atmosphere for both business pleasure and for family. Hotel is clean and staff is very friendly at all levels. Looking forward to returning back to the casino for another pleasure trip.
40,"Stayed at the Park MGM in October 2018 and they had not yet finished the front and all the restaurants. Looking forward to coming back sometime soon to see the finished product. Stay well room was nice and the hotel really seems to have become a fresh ""addition"" to the Strip after the change from Monte Carlo."
40,We stayed here because the park theater was located there . I had bought Areosmith tickets. Very handy. Only 2 things that would of made our stay better. Coffee pots in the rooms. Clients have to go to the lobby to get coffee and pay 6.50 a cup. When you first get up no one wants to go down 18 floors to get coffee. The air conditioning wasn't working the best. Had it set on 60 and still was a bit hot at night . We talked to other people staying here and they all had the same problem.
30,"Well they definitelt ""renovated"" this property but it certainly was not remodeled. The rooms are still large closets with awful views and non functioning AC units. Eataly is amazing however and is truly a unique experience to the strip. However and a big HOWEVER you don't need to stay here to experience it. Bavettes is likely the better of the steakhouses on the strip with Carnevino gone. But this particular trip the 22OZ bone in ribeye was thoroughly over cooked. Likely would have been better if they offered a smaller ribeye ans we ordered two. My wife ans I shared the 22OZ.    Some of the pit bosses when gambling were calling out very nit picky things seemingly to be mean. We play a lot of craps and I have never seen so many players get called out on things."
40,Great place to stay! Only caution: If you use a food/beverage promotion check your final charges closely -- it is rarely applied which makes the omission seem intentional. Otherwise this girl is an amazing value with a laid back feeling.
50,Awesome close to everything! The slots don’t pay out no money. The layout is nice not to big so your not as tried of walking around! Next door to Aria and tram to get to other hotels and shopping my fav.
20,NOTE: If you are not a coffee drinker this review becomes 4 stars.    Nice hotel. Small but practical room. Easy checkin/checkout. Convenient location. Friendly vibe.    The floor is 5 stars. Plenty of tables. $10 blackjack. Fun craps tables. Knowledgeable and helpful dealers.    Eately is decent. Nothing really memorable about offering but this was first time and dinners were out of the hotel for this trip.    So I am in on work/pleasure a few times a year. Work all hours and try to get some gambling and fine dining in while in. Every hotel I have stayed at on strip has at least 1 24 hour spot for fresh coffee. A must for whatever you are doing in Vegas. Well Park is a big spot and they have 1 Starbucks. It doesn't open until 6a and closes at 10p. Minimum 10 minute wait each and every time. Unacceptable. That being said employees super friendly.    To each their own but for me this is a deal breaker. Like I said if you are not a coffee drinker or don't mind tracking it over to Aria where they have 3 3 24 hour coffee options this place might be fine for you.
50,"This was our first time at the MGM Park. Transferred from the Embassy Suites on Swenson to be close to friends and the Aerosmith show at the Park Theater. Our experience (3 nights) was really great. Super easy auto-check-in and check-out but there are staff right there if help is needed. The venue is conveniently located on the Strip. The onsite dining options are amazing but there are many in the surraounding area as well - I wish we had an ""Eataly Market"" back home but if we did I'd weigh 500 lbs. At every turn the Park staff was helpful and so courteous. Total focus on customer service which in this industry is a real plus. The only ""not perfect"" score I offer is due to the room itself - it was spotlessly clean but just sparse: no frills just a bed (comfortable) TV (nice) and bath (squeaky clean). The price was a super-good value and we were not in Vegas to stay in the room so it was more than adequate for a place to sleep in between activities. Overall the MGM park is a really great place to stay in Vegas.    Be aware that in addition to the room rate they will add a ""resort fee"" to your daily rate. They all do - it's a way to keep the per-day rate low when you shop the comparison travel sites. We were aware of this so no surprise for us. The other couple we were with DID NOT know about it so it was a shocker when they checked out. So be sure to do your homework and be smart when making your travel plans. Bon Voyage!"
10,"Casino is pathetic place is overrun with expensive food options rooms were terrible.    Smallest hotel room I ever stayed in no dresser of any kind and very limited storage drawers for clothes no customer service at check-in mostly an Italian food court called ""Eataly"" or something like that. Ridiculous bathroom sink and counter no in-room refrigerator terrible room décor including overhead light wiring that is stapled up the wall and across the ceiling to the light. Looks like the wiring in my garage.    If this is the best they could do with this hotel and casino they should have just imploded it completely. Pools are pathetic compared to old pool area.    Monte Carlo was a much much better hotel and a good reasonably priced place to stay. They just jacked up the room rates here because they did some kind of refurb on it and put in a few shiny new shops.    We stayed at Monte Carlo probably 20 times over the years here....won't be staying here ever again."
30,Mattresses were awful. The towels were apparently a hot commodity because we could not get them no matter now many times we requested them. The beds themselves were very low didn’t seem like a normal height.
10,My sister and I are at the hotel as we speak! Check in was a breeze. Room is clean but small. Sister won a decent amount of money so you would think this hotel would have a great vibe—no! The people in the room beside us have alternated between trashing the room (at least it sounded that way) to cranking the music to the point that we can’t sleep! Called security twice and they won’t move us and won’t toss the neighbors without two warnings!?! Not sure if they’ve even talked to the neighbors but since the music is still cranked I assume not! We’re used to noise in Vegas hotels but this is ridiculous! We won’t be back!
30,This was our first visit since the renovation and a little disappointed. The design of the room is rather awkward. When the closet door is open you can’t get out of the bathroom. There is absolutely no storage in the rooms. I like to put my clothes away and hang them up. There are two small drawers in the closet and 5 total hangers for 2 people. I bring more clothes than that for a 4 day stay. The bathroom has no place to put toiletries either. A small shelf unit that also houses towels and under the sink on the floor is all there is. Most hotels anymore have a coffee maker and a small fridge but none in this room. The check in process is on your own. This may make it faster but it also eliminates the ability to ask questions and get information when we arrived. I did not like this at all. Very cold and unwelcoming    On a better note the new Italian food court is a welcome addition. Reminds me of the markets in Italy. The location is the reason we are staying here. Right across the street from T Mobile Area and the Park Theater for concerts. Unfortunately our next trip to Vegas we will choose a different hotel.
50,Really nice hotel next to The Park Aria T mobile arena and NY NY. And free tram ride away from Bellagio and Crystals. Eataly was fun but can be expensive. The Park offers more dining options along with free music and free games outside such as corn hole giant jenga foosball etc. Would totally recommend this hotel!!!
40,The hotel is in a great location with the Park Theater attached T Mobile arena and the Strip right there. Check in was fine. It is self check in but someone will help you if you get stuck. The pool area was beautiful but the music was loud and annoying. There were always seats and towels available. Room was clean. Unfortunately the cleaner left our room with the deadbolt propping the door one day. Thankfully nothing was stolen. The water smelled a bit of sulfur but that went away after the first day. Like most hotels on the strip you have to walk through the casino to get in and out. But if you sit down at the slots they will bring you free drinks. So it's all good!
30,Customer service was awesome but design of shower and sinks not good. Concierge gave us some good credit but they never got to take care of the issue to avoid it happening again. Definitely could do better at keeping things cleaned in the room
20,"Check-in process took forever. Surprised by dark dismal gloomy hallways leading to rooms. Room was just ""ok"". Loved the view of pools below & couch window seating area however room looked outdated dark & mediocre furniture. Biggest surprise was the stench of the pillows what the heck? I was repelled. Eventually we received fresh(er) pillows & were able to sleep. Loud booming noises didn't last too long from outside. I liked the easy to adjust window shades allowing for varying levels of light. The shower filled up with water ... they don't seem to keep general maintenance in order. Surprised ""Lady Gaga"" is appearing at Theater of such a below par establishment (maybe 30 years from now? But not while she's still popular & in her ""heyday""). Most folks here are helpful & accommodating from the concierge to those helping with their little clip-boards during check-in the VIP desk the bell desk & housekeeping staff. ""Eataly"" is awesome & interesting but was closed early (before noon) when we were there & then when we returned a madhouse. Had a meal at ""Primrose"" restaurant while I like the idea (a quaint ""French Garden"" theme could be an oasis in the midst of a casino if they did it right) it looked dirty with visible dead bugs & live flying moths in the menu window box as well as a thick brown scum inside the creamer cup. All of this with a hefty price tag & a VERY nasty waitress be warned. Absolutely not up to ""MGM"" standards but perhaps those are a thing of the past?"
50,Other than the check in machine not working this hotel is my first choice. From the VIP service the sleep well floor and rooms to Eaterly I highly recommend staying here. The Italian restaurant hall was outstanding! I will definitely look forward to returning here during our next visit.
50,Great concert!! Great place for any concert. Small venue so not a bad seat in the place. Holds around 5000 people. The acoustics were amazing!! Stephen Tyler sounds just as awesome as he did in the 80’s!!!!
30,My husband sold this place to me on the basis that it was totally renovated and classy. Upon fist walking in I believed him. The Little Italian set up was beautiful but we were sad to see we had to check ourselves in on tablets. The face to face personal touch is very important when staying at a new hotel and we never actually got to speak to anyone. Upon walking into the casino the smell of smoke was overwhelming. Our room was just ok but not up to the high standards I have become accustomed to over time. I will say the room/ hotel was very clean and conveniently located on the strip. But I must also mention that our room must have been too close to the pool because around 10:30am the base of the music was so loud it was super irritating and didn’t end till like 5pm. Ugghhhh  We have no reason to ever stay here again. There are just so many other beautiful properties to stay at home in Vegas.
50,From the best location to the easiest check in and out. To the quietest room and the most comfortable bed ever . Great slot machines to play  great room rates using my m life We loved the Eataly experience
50,Great hotel. Courteous staff. Everyone was very helpful. Prices were great for a hotel this nice. We got two rooms for what we would have paid for one at some other casinos. The staff went out of their way to make sure we were satisfied.
40,We came for a girls trip to see Aerosmith! The check in was very quick and easy everyone was very helpful and friendly. Our room was ready early and getting our luggage from downstairs was very quick! Hotel is very clean.Room was good! The theater was great I loved the seating and stage! And concert was amazing! The one thing we were disappointed in was there wasn’t a variety of easy food places! And especially late at night!
40,Found this gem on the internet price was right the hotel was super clean the location was right on the strip and the back access was open to 3 or 4 other hotels. We didn't get to the pool but it looked nice. We would definitely go back.
50,The park mgm was perfect. Our room was immaculate and their customer service was outstanding. I can highly recommend the park mgm for it's great location and proximity to the park theater and the overall comfort and kindness of the staff
50,My first stay here was during construction and it was fine; now that it's finished I think Park MGM will be my go-to. This time I stayed in a two queen bed room. I liked the setup more than the King bedroom. Each bedroom has a built in couch which is not good for sleeping but can probably seat five of you're meeting with a group in your room to pre game. The rooms are modern and clean. One negative is that they still have a door to connect to another room that lets a lot of noise in. I liked the bathroom remodel. The windows are wide with nice views. The location is tremendous with the Park Theater and T Mobile arena just steps away. Plenty of good interesting restaurants Including Eataly which you walk through to get to the strip- it smells fantastic. Eataly has wine bars a pizzeria sandwich shop market and pastry shop. Park MGM doesn't have a buffet but you can take the team to Aria for that. The one place.That they need to work on is the Moneyline sports bar by the sports book. It's hard to see from the casino and I never saw anybody in there. The pool area is pleasant with calm colors and three pools for Park guests. NoMad boutique hotel at the top of the building has their own pool. The casino is mid sized by Vegas standards which I liked. Not too small but hard to get lost. Overall I recommend this place highly.
50,Zero issues really good service will be coming back hotel is clean and big. Nice clubs good food easy parking and transport bell desk is super nice would definitely recommend to any of my friends or family
50,Have always loved the Monte Carlo- it's easy layout and location. Decided to give the Park MGM a try after the recent re-branding and will admit that I was nervous after many negative reviews. Let me just say that the Park MGM was wonderful- start to finish- classy hip and above all staffed with a top notch team of professionals.    Ahead of my trip my flights were changed due to the 737/Max issues.. resulting in a very early arrival on a Saturday with my dad. I took a moment to reach out and make arrangements for an early check in to ensure comfort and an easy start to our vacation after long flight from east coast.    What I did not expect was service that was off the charts- above and beyond- and a complete WOW. Arrangements were made and a guest relations professional reached out to me prior to our journey to make certain every part of our stay was impeccable. The level of service and the special treatment received by the Park MGM team was beyond anything I have ever received in my years of travel.    Upon arrival the lobby was packed and as we started the kiosk check-in Anthony approached us and offered help- I witnessed same throughout. He was beyond kind and ensured that our room close to an elevator and in a quiet area was provided. His kindness welcoming smile and genuine interest in our experience is what we need more of in today's world.    Our room was terrific- unique- mod- and a bit quirky- all intentional and well done. The bathrooms amenities and bedding were all first class. Parking garage was easy to navigate and had well marked handicapped spaces and easy access to elevators.    The pool area at the Monte Carlo was nice- and the Park MGM re-do was superb. Very well laid out spaces- almost like separate rooms- complete with minty green striped umbrellas trellises and plenty of deck chairs- including in-pool loungers. The service again was off the charts- the kindest wait staff always checking in yet not obtrusive. And my jaw dropped as a man in a 3 piece suit meticulously walked the area picking up the tiniest bits of debris and leaves. The place is truly remarkable. We had some nachos 1 day and the platter was enough for a family of 4! Not to mention the ice cold water stations throughout. I just cannot say enough about the pool area- which in my opinion is an important part of the Vegas experience (and I must admit we had an absolutely MISERABLE experience for part 2 of our week in vegas at the Flamingo- separate review coming..)    Eataly the casino the house of Gaga Nomad- all these new additions were a delight to explore. The casino is also hip lively spacious impeccably clean and easy to get a drink while playing. We love being able to take the tram over to Bellagio where the fountains and the music hold a special place in our hearts (and always will).    I'm truly sad that our 4 nights at Park MGM went so quickly. Every moment was a delight- and this property is a FRESH escape on the strip tucked nicely adjacent to the Park and NY NY.    Finally Lea and her impeccable skills as a guest experience specialist are priceless and will clearly help to propel this property to the top of the charts. All I can say is that this get away with my dad and the WOW experience provided by the Park MGM and Bellagio teams have made me a fan for life- and will always hold a special place in our hearts. The world truly needs more people like Lea- If others in the service industry could only be as caring considerate and truly passionate about what they do- oh what a wonderful place.    Park MGM is pure class- meets and exceeds this family's standards. thank you very much.
30,Where you could have a simple meal online it showed a lot of different options when we got there to eat it was closed we could sit in Bar the menu had 4 options maybe more had dinner a bagel from Starbucks
50,If you want to get away from the noise and overwhelming stress of people on the strip but still be on the street this hotel is for you. Feels like an expensive boutique hotel at an affordable price. Enjoyed the simplicity and ease this hotel provides.
50,Spacious rooms! Hotel staff was amazing and so helpful! The casino is nice open and we never found a dealer or attendant that wasn’t super friendly! We also attended a concert at the Park Theatre what a great venue!! We will definitely be back!
50,Park MGM always surpasses my expectations. Their staff is friendly and helpful the food in all the restaurants is delicious and it’s s much more cultured place to stay than most of the rest of the strip. I feel like I’m in a cute neighborhood when there rather than in a smoke-filled crowded casino.
40,Stayed at the Park MGM recently. First time for us since the major remodel. Rooms were nice with modern furnishings. Great swimming pools if you are interested in that. Casino much like the others. Food and drink expensive again much like others in LV
50,Excellent experience. Beautiful facility. Casino was the best of the several neighboring properties we visited too. The tram connection to Aria and Bellagio is handy and the location makes it really easy to go south to NY/NY or across the strip to the MGM. We loved the custom touches in the rooms the artwork up and down the halls and the pool is awesome. The Eataly and La La Noodles were both excellent meals but our favorite experience was Gaga's Enigma. The show was great of course but the theatre is fantastic too. Not a bad seat in the house and the lobbies are amazing. Would happily stay here again.
40,Loved our visit. Eatly was great and so much fun. We took the mixology class at the Juniper Bar if you are curious about how to make a great drink and learn about alcohol you don't normally drink this class was worth the money. If you can do it I say go for it. you wont be disappointed.
50,I loved the Par MGM for the value and friendliness of staff. The selection of table and video games was excellent. The food at Eataly was amazing. Had a wonderful experience and I will definitely return.
50,Our second time here and not disappointed. Since we came the first time they finished the remodel and it looks great. Great pools food and staff. We went to the pool party at Jemma and I was very pleased since it was small but not over the top like many are.
30,"Make sure you specify whether you want ""accessible"" room or not. We were given one without asking for one and don't recommend it. No dressers to put clothes no drawers in bathroom for toiletries etc."
10,The hotel has been renovated but is not great. Rooms are small and mine was filthy. I found hair in the bathroom candy wrapper on the floor and stains on the sheets. Also the room smelled really bad. In addition the air conditioning barely worked and the shower wouldn’t drain. Better choices out there.
40,The hotel itself is located right in the middle of strip. Clean and newly renovated. Checking in and out was a breeze. However they under staffing on the casino floor in terms of slots attendant. It took a very long time to locate someone to pay out a slots jackpot . Food court selections were e
50,This was probably the fourth time we have stayed at the Park MGM (since it was converted from the Monte Carlo) and it was by far the best. We stayed in a Skylark Suite (FANTASTIC) and everything about our stay was exceptional.
50,This hotel is awesome .... my fav part was how comfy the beds were!!!! Didnt want to leave in the morning 😂.totally recommend it here.. need to try their restaurants next time... liked how quick my issues were resloved as i was checking in ... after reading that my room wasnt ready amd speaking to the vip desk they got me in a room real quick ...great job and thank you
10,"From the minute you get there you get the sense that Park MGM doesn't care about the guests and you are on your own. You check yourself in it's a pretty impersonal non-welcoming experience and it looked like a lot of people had trouble with it. The room is OK no dresser no desk the door to the closet is also the door to the bathroom. Nice power connections near the bed but don't expect to plug anything in bigger than a cell phone. The pool is nice I reserved a chair for $40. Not once did a waitress come over to ask if I wanted anything I got myself a drink at the bar. Someone did come over to make sure I belonged there. No maid service. I asked the lady in the hallway at 10 am if someone could get our room done while we were out - they finally showed up at 4 pm. The restaurants were nice that was the only experience I actually had with any hotel ""staff."" Otherwise it was like staying in a place that had no hotel staff."
50,came to the Park MGM in June 2019 with 9 other family and friends.  the concert was amazing the Haus of GaGa is great. We all had a great time at Eataly. The bars restaurants lounges and casino we loved. Had a cabana at the pool one day really great. would return!!
40,We have stayed in many hotels in Vegas both downtown and on the Strip. We had wonderful service at the pool pool bar and casino bar. However the kiosk check-in was horrible. First no one could find our reservation. After a couple of attendants tried on the kiosk another put a code in after an interminable wait. We understood our room was not ready but by 6 pm we still could not get our keys. The kiosk attendant Ahrlene was extremely rude and unhelpful to us. She actually raised her voice to us and should not be in customer service. Luckily another worker Elizabeth was our lifesaver. She immediately helped us and was welcoming. Great location room amenities. We will give this another try. Bad first impression!
50,The Park MGM has a much better atmosphere and look as compared to the old Monte Carlo. The only thing I would change is the color of the hallways leading to the rooms. The drab and dark color of green is reminiscent of walking the green mile. (Referencing the movie) It should have a brighter and more inviting color. Otherwise the rooms are nicely done with a more modern look and feel. The beds and pillows are very comfortable and the a/c works to perfection keeping up with the hot desert Vegas weather. Very nice improvement!
40,Good stay just basic amenities. The room is spacious and not that sound proof but still you can sleep. Just dont expect too much for the hotel coz its one of the basic stay in Las Vegas. And also they have variety of restaurants near casinos.
10,Not a cheaply priced resort plus resort fee plus pay for even self park. No refrigerator or coffee maker in room and the one Starbuck's there never had enough staff for less than a 30 minute wait.
30,Air conditioning wasn’t great and pillows were bulky thick and uncomfortable. Other than that a standard room experience service staff were receptive and did what they could do to help. Also wish the tv was working when we got in..but this was fixed the next day
10,Rooms need updating and need to be clean. We stayed for my nieces wedding. We all issues with our rooms and bills. The pool towels had spots all over them. This could be a nice hotel. Was very disappointed. We always stay at the Aria. Thought we would try them. Big mistake.
50,Best hotel if you're heading to see a music concert at Park Theater or T-Mobile. The hotel connection to Aria is very convenient especially if you play poker the room is right in front as you come down the stairs.
30,"Even though this is a newly reopened hotel it felt badly done. There were three couples there for the weekend to see Lady Gaga and all of us felt like they got a new coat of paint carpet and some new framed ""art"". Since we were not going to spend much time in our room we were OK with it. The biggest complaint we had was the A/C that seemed to recycle very stale air. We had our set on 60 degrees and it never was that cool on our room. Casino ventilation was bad too-very basic casino with very smokey air. The best part of the Park MGM was Eataly and other restaurants within."
50,Nicely renovated hotel. The rooms are very fresh and appropriately layed out. However the room only had a small set of drawers to put away your clothes. So just be prepared to leave it out in your suitcase.    The air conditioner was good but didn’t get the room cool enough. Note it was 98+ degrees outside so this might account for the warmth in the room. The bathroom is nice but the toilet is not made for short people. Also the shower door lacks some of the seals to keep the water from flooding the bathroom floor. Otherwise the water flow was strong and hot.    It is a location that I would book again.
50,The remodel of the Park MGM is modern looking and the rooms are laid out very efficiently. Staff was very friendly especially those that I would meet at random on the floors. New Eately eating area is fun and a unique approach.
50,Quick access to strip upgraded and great staff! Food was excellent pool party life was fun casino was clean and all staff courteous. Look forward to an opportunity to return. Thanks Mlife for recommending this location!
20,Very basic hotel if you're going to pay this price you should stay at the Cosmo or Aria. Its like a Motel 6 once you get in the room not even a mini bar. The in room table was basically a wood antique from your grandmothers place.
50,Clean hotel with easy access to Bellagio on the tram. Indoor walkway to Aria. The only drawback is there is not enough storage in the rooms. Pool is very nice. Eataly is the highlight of this hotel and the casino is easy to navigate.
50,My sister and I were there to see Lady Gaga and to visit family. The concert was phenomenal I just wish there was more accessibility for fans. Meet and greet tickets through the Park theater are 10k. Just know if you go there and want to meet her that is the price. The hotel was great no complaints.
50,"Was in town with family to see GAGA (which was fantastic!) and decided to stay at the Park since the show was here at the hotel. Room was clean and well appointed. First hotel I've stayed in that didn't have a dresser but other than that it was fine. Had a ""young crowd"" vibe with good music everywhere including the elevators. Had my daughters dancing on the way to their room. Concert venue was great as well."
40,We are regular UK visitors to Vegas and stay at different hotels each year. We chose This Park MGM as we visited it last year when it was being renovated from the Monte Carlo. Our book in was chaotic as the room which we had booked was already allocated. It was confusing what they were offering us as a alternative and had to confirm the following morning that the room we were given would be the one we would be staying in for our 12 night stay. We did secure 3 nights resort fees as a comps however this wasn’t fully confirmed until we checked out. The reason for choosing this property was that it was quite last year and staff were easy to locate. This wasn’t the case whilst we stayed as Park MGM had Lady Gaga as the resident performer. Whenever she was playing the hotel was over run and clearly not enough staff available to cope something that a senior member of their staff agreed with when we were checking out. The rooms are good and the extension of the Aria express to the Park makes it very accessible. Their WiFi is rubbish as it keeps logging you out. The sinks in the bathrooms are aesthetically very modern although not fit for purpose as it is impossible to make them drain. All in all this property is ok but could do better.
10,1) The new remodel was so bad  2) Check-in was good but the new system is not user-friendly and self-explanatory (I work in IT so I know what I'm talking about)  3) The rooms have a weird design with fairly cheap furniture. Honestly the first glance ruined my entire image of old Monte Carlo.  4) Why guests have to pay for parking? (Don't be that cheap!!)  5) Even motels have a small coffee maker and a mini fridge in their rooms. This hotel has been designed in a way to push people to eat at the hotel restaurant or dine out. This is a double profit for the stingy Park MGM as it brings more revenue and it causes less expenses as they don't have to buy the fridges. But what if the guest has some leftover food or medicines such as insulin that requires to be cold? (Shame on your cheap stupid and stingy strategies!!)
50,Room was very clean and recently renovated. Massive shower instead of a tub  which worked great for me. Recommend food from burger bar in hotel. Possibly the best burger I ever had.  Staff all friendly and looking for chance to do more than I asked of them .  Great casino. Had all of my favorite slots. Best cocktail waitresses ever !!! Never had to wait long for a drink and always served with a smile. )  Quite happy to do all my gambling there.
20,My room was not very nice. Smelled like someone smoked marijuana in it. The check in process has terminals to check in at but no one to really speak with. Wish there were more people working.    In the mornings the Starbucks line is INSANE. We went to Primrose and that coffee line was better but only one person working.    In the casino while playing slots could not get a drink. I was playing 3 nights and all 3 nights I saw the same waitress. She had a section to herself and couldn’t keep up. More staff is needed all around.    Honestly this is my least favorite hotel of MGM.    The one praise I have is for Rachel Fouts in the spa. Absolutely amazing massage out by the pool and she was super personable and friendly. I would come back for a massage.
30,It took us 45 minutes just to check in. The room was hot and the pillows were awful. Not a strong AC at all. The restaurants were good and the dealers at the tables and the pit bosses were very nice. Good location but not my favorite.
30,Room was clean but the walls are thin. Heard every detail of a fight in the room next door starting at around 4am. Was not a fan. Very bare bones room. Perfect if you are using the room purely for getting ready.
40,The Park MGM Las Vegas is in a great location centrally located on the strip close to almost everything with excellent food choices on property as well as great places to eat right on the hotel property. The room not plush by any means and lacks amenities but it is clean and quite and the bed was very comfortable.    The new self check in system is shocking to see but if you like high tech it was quite amazing and their was a person to help guide me through the system.... and thankfully it did not take long. In general I don’t like these systems and fight them but this one worked great and was pleasant. The computer printed out my room keys and receipt after I put in my driver’s lic and credit card so literally if you knew hope to operate it you would not need human assistance to check in.    These rooms are priced on the budget side and you are not getting the best of Vegas in the room but if you are like most people in Vegas you do not spend much time in your room anyway.
50,Really enjoyed my stay. The room was clean and well decorated. The self-check-in took a while since we wanted connecting rooms. The person helping us tried to find connecting rooms for us but she could only find rooms across from each other which was fine.
50,Our first stay was for a concert at the property and we couldn't have been happier. Location was great concert venue is outstanding and it was convenient. Loved the pool and the Italian markets. Rooms were well appointed and the beds were very comfortable. Finally great great service!
30,This is a perfectly good hotel depending on what you want out of your stay in Vegas. I had a nice clean room. The bed was very comfortable and I had a good night sleep. The shower was also very nice and had good water pressure. They had plugs all over the room including usb plugs so it was very easy to charge all my electronics. We checked in at the desk instead of the self-check in and the lady was great. She upgraded my dad so he could get a handicap accessible room. We really liked eating in the Eataly place located in the hotel - great food and fun to wander around.    Now for all the little things that bothered me:  -There was no closet in my room so the outfit I wanted to hang up so it wouldn't be wrinkled didn't have anywhere to go. There were 2 hooks by the door but no hangers. I guess I could have asked the front desk for hangers?  -There was no refrigerator so I couldn't keep the water I bought cold.  -This is perhaps the thing that bothered me the most. I was in a room on the side facing the pools and I wanted to take a nap one afternoon but couldn't because the music they were playing at the pool was loud enough that the bass reverberated through the room. I even put headphones in which drowned out some of the noise but I could still FEEL the bass. Not very restive.  -Another loud noice was that I could perfectly hear my neighbors raising and lowering their blinds and opening their room door. It was so crystal clear that for a moment I thought someone had gotten into my room.  -The room color choice was also weird. It was VERY red. I actually really like the color red but this color made the room feel dark and angry. My friend stayed in room where the color throughout was green and it was actually quite soothing. This is just a very nitpicky detail so feel free to ignore this.    So overall this place is fine not great. Its somewhat noisy depending on your room but the location is good and so is the food.
20,With all of the bad reviews we arrived expecting the worst. We checked in online before arrival and received a text that our room was ready at 10:30 am about an hour before arrival. No issues with getting our keys printed. There were quite a few attendants to help people having trouble.  Went to our room lovely view of the air conditioning units. We had to keep our shade drawn the entire time anyway to keep the temp down as the air conditioning did not work well. Temp said 67 but there is no way it was that cool. We had trouble sleeping because it was too warm.  The room itself was ok but such a poor design. Super low but comfortable bed. A weird velvet couch in front of the window with a way too big dining size table with one leather chair. Both the table and the chair took up way too much room and were not needed. What was needed is a dresser! There is no place to unpack except for 2 tiny drawers in the closet. If they took out the table and chair there would be room for a dresser and a desk.  The bathroom was nice with a great shower and shelving for storage- no complaints there. The barn door was awkward but not as bad as I was expecting.  We liked the size of the casino. No way to get lost! The dealers were friendly. The restaurants that we went to were great but there is no place to eat after 10:30. Would have been nice to have an option especially after a concert.  We saw both Lady Gaga shows which were incredible.  The pools were nice and service ok but they don't clean up used glasses and food items until the end of the day so everything just sits there in the baking sun. We had to beg our server to take away our empty cups and she complained! It was gross- someone had spilled a bloody mary on a chair in the morning. By the end of the day it was a baked on mess. This area needs serious attention and should be kept clean.  We had a comped room which was why we choose to stay here but would not pay to stay unless they fix the rooms and the AC.
50,First time staying here and was surprised at how wonderful this hotel and the entire experience was. Clean comfortable updated rooms easy to get around location is perfect close to tons of restaurants and everything is conveniently located. Will definitely be back!
20,We stayed at this hotel because we went to the Lady Gaga concert. Thought it would be nice to stay on property. It wasn’t! No room amenities room smelled of sewer and the floors in our room were uneven. No dresser no mini fridge no coffee maker.
30,Hotel is recently renovated. The average deco is average compare to other hotels nearby but with a very reasonable price; so don;t expect it is like a Aria or Cosmopolitan nearby. Room is clean but it is a bit poor in sound barrier. I found the hotel is a bit dark especially in the hall way. Fast auto check-in / check-out and it is easy to use. Most of the customer services are great; except for Bell Desk/Luggage Service which I have a bad experience on. The lady Bonnie has a very attitude. Overall I would give a 3 stars to hotel only.
40,I had a problem with room keys and room service other than that it was a  Nice stay great location  Access to tram eatery was good but at busy hours good luck finding a table  We didn’t tried room dining  One thing for sure my room had a best  Shower clean n water pressure was a great clean hotel staffs say hi when you pass by
30,"Just returned from a four night stay at the Park MGM in Las Vegas. Having been a longtime customer of  the Monte Carlo resort we were curious as to the changes after rebranding and in all honesty they sent me four free night offer. Free being only the room charge and not including a resort fee taxes and parking fee. Ha Ha.  From the start:  Check in is atrocious. A kiosk meets you. Not a desk clerk who can actually help you. You are met by a bank of around 18 kiosks and maybe if you are lucky 3 roaming agents who may or may not be available to assist you with the process. On a busy day prepare yourself to spend a good amount of time here and if it is prior to 3:00PM be prepared to return and go through much of the process again. More on this later.  I reserved 3 rooms. The first was the room which was ""free"" the second room was discounted as it was booked with the free room. The 3rd was booked separately under another offer. Interestingly enough the paid room was ""ready"" at check in but the free room and additional room booked under that offer were not yet available. Nice way to take care of your loyal clients MGM.  As we had 3 rooms we would have liked to be all on the same floor. There is a way to do this with the roaming clerks but I was told it would delay our getting to the rooms by at least an hour. Really? A desk clerk could have knocked this out in 5 minutes without inconveniencing the customer. We ended up with rooms on floors 45 and 8. Just what we wanted LOL. The two rooms which were not ready required returning to the check in area waiting in line again submitting all your identifying information again and finally if all is correct printing out room keys for you. Absolutely ridiculous.  Let's talk room:  Who designed these things? They really took MGM for a ton of money for nothing. I could get anyone to do a phenomenal job for a quarter of what was probably charged. There is no dresser desk refrigerator or real closet. The decor is just stark and drab. Our room was drab olive green and tan. The sofa was an upright slab with some worn out ugly pillows. The ugly olive drab chair spent most of the time covered with my suitcase because there was only one luggage rack. The bathroom and closet are served by one sliding door. Either the bathroom is closed off or the closet. Not both. This is just stupid. The closet has nothing but a small hanging rack and two small filing cabinet type drawers. The ice bucket and two glasses are in the closet also because I guess there is nowhere else to put them. The bathroom vanity is so small it is unusable by two people at one time. The only saving grace for the bathroom was the shower. Thank you for getting rid of the useless tub. All in all a Motel 6 type room.  Our room was 3/4 of the way down the hall. What a trek down a depressing dark hallway. We dubbed it the Long Green Mile for the ugly drab green carpeting and dark green/black doors. Even the wall paper was depressing. It was hummingbirds but could have easily been vultures. To make matters worse it was freezing in the hallways.  Restaurants:  I have never seen a Las Vegas resort where all the eating places are closed by 11pm. What happened to the great Cafe which was opened and serving food all night long?  Also a bunch of the bars closed by 9 pm. Really? This is Las Vegas.  Now for the good stuff:  The pool cabana was great. I have never spent time by the pool but it was our granddaughters 21st  birthday and we had 7 people so I sprang for the cabana for a hangover Tueday. It was wonderful. Everything was there from a fridge and TV to fan misters even a gaming system. Taryn our dedicated  server was phenomenal.  The casino was playing this trip. We were able to play slots and video poker for extended periods with not a big investment. Unusual for MGM Resorts as the slots are usually pretty tight.  Finally the staff:  As usual this is what makes this resort. The staff is always courteous pleasant and helpful. This has not changed from the old Monte Carlo although there is obviously not as many of them. Unfortunate as only the customer suffers.  Rating:    I would like to like this resort. We have stayed here many times as the Monte Carlo and we are very disappointed with the changes made. I know everything changes but why not change for the better not to the detriment of the customer. I hate to say it but this will likely be our first and last trip to Park MGM."
40,Just finished up staying June 11th-13th for Lady Gaga’s show “Enigma” also playing at the park theater.    Rooms have been recently updated and are modern and inviting. The room and bathroom are more than spacious for 2 people. The only reason I’m giving 4 stars instead of 5 is the lack of mini fridge and in room coffee pot.    The pool was very upbeat and cleans as well as the casino. Eatery was a great place to grab a bite to eat on the cheaper side.    Lady Gaga’s show was amazing as well at the Park theater. Very intimate with 5000 people instead of 20000 in an arena or stadium.    Had a great weekend and will definitely make a stay in the future.
40,My wife and I stayed at the Park MGM and had a great time. The Night Hawk suite was spacious and clean. The hotel is conveniently located to the Park Theater and T Mobile Arena. The pool has three distinct areas and the East Pool is adults only Friday through Sunday.
10,First we had issues with our parking and we could not be helped by the staff of Park MGM. Secondly our blinds were broken we called the front desk and they said they’d send people our way. They didn’t show up so we had to call again and they finally came at night. We wasted our whole day in our room and couldn’t even sleep. My brother and I were on a business trip and this made us very stressed out.
40,Just a basic Vegas hotel no gimmicks. Comfortable place to lay your head down some place nice and clean. Great location in the strip and monorail to take you to the Bellagio. The Eatly is a great place to grab food. We utilized the pool on Sunday. Awesome.. we reserved seating the service was great the drinks needed an extra shot. I would stay here again if the rate was great.
40,This hotel is in a great location on the strip. The tram makes it easy to get to the Bellagio Crystals and Aria. Little Eataly is a great addition. The price is reasonable for Las Vegas. It isn’t as luxurious as some of the other hotels but for the price you pay it’s unbeatable. We stayed in a stay well room and really enjoyed it. The beds were comfortable and the air quality in the room was fantastic! The service was a little slower than usual but it was understandable considering it was a holiday weekend! Overall the staff was friendly and helpful. If you have an M Life credit card parking is free
40,I had some reservation when I booked this hotel for family trip in Vegas (not as oxymoron as one would think) after reading negative reviews. After coming back I can see where they came from but I'm wondering if it's too quick to write off this hotel.    I think this hotel was better than expected as a family hotel that focused on food value and location. No one will mistake this hotel with Aria or Bellagio but it doesn't try to. For the money that I paid for (I didn't have personal promotion) I was pleasantly surprised that the hotel did look somewhat new after renovation hotel wasn't small but wasn't gigantic it had free tram to Aria/Bellagio the crowd was more family like than I expected.    Yes room doesn't have fridge and it charges crazy rate yes the self kiosk (while it worked for me) seemed like an issue for a lot other people yes the hotel still had some smell of smoke (as fitting for Vegas hotel) yes the hotel doesn't exactly have a view to speak of.    but at the end of the day I think it was pretty good hotel for someone who wants a bit of everything flexible looking for mini version of Vegas tad bit grown up. That's how I personally felt.
20,The is that it is a safe hotel and the location is decent on the strip. Mostly just little issues that you don't expect at a hotel let alone a Vegas hotel. Stained sheets and comforter at arrival light bulbs out safe in the room not reset from prior customer can't get room cleaned after 4 forgot hand towels when cleaning the room just to name a few. The hotel has one big issue though...no storage in the room. All you have is 5 hangers. No dresser or drawers of any kind in the room. You are literally living out of your suitcase and Vegas in the summer I bring extra clothes (Its going to be at least 100 degrees your going to sweat). We had a two queen bed room between my mom and I and they only gave us one suitcase stand!!!
20,Limited staff self service check-in and out no front desk very Smokey in entire hotel rooms very stark with no amenities to speak of. If you want to spend allot of money and receive not much in return this is your place
40,Lady Gaga was awesome! The hotel was great with the exception of the very loud annoying dj playing African drum music all afternoon. The young person assisting people checking in was wonderful. She helped us get a room by doing a search on her IPad.
20,be careful they will nickel and dime you with parking and resort fees that add up to more than room cost. fellow at the vip checkout was also very snotty and rude. have a swim if you like swimming in ice water. next time i will stick to ceasars properties
20,Had a horrible check in and Check out experience. They couldn’t get the room keys printed and then upon checkout  the kiosk didn’t work and it ended up charging my CC 4 times.  Rooms ok price not that great and you will get dinged with the large resort fee.
40,I was skeptical at first as I have read bad reviews in reference to this hotel. They have Kiosk for check-in which went smoothly as they have several employees to help you out. Park MGM used to be the Montecarlo Hotel. They did an amazing job renovating the hotel. The room is spacious and clean employees were pleasant and they have three swimming pools. I would stay in this hotel again as you can get from here to the Bellagio Aria Cosmopolitan and the Crystal City Shopping Venter via a free Tram. They also have Lala Noodles Nomad Bar and Eataly for good eats!
50,Excellent hotel and service. Cleancomfortabe bed and pillows.  Eataly was a great choice for a variety of Italian food  On The Record was a blast. Lady Gaga was amazing. Pool was beautiful and the Primrose rest was perfect.  Make sure you ask for an itemized bill upon check outas we had some charged added that needed adjustments. Do NOT pick up anything from mini bar or anything on top because ypu will be charged for just touching it. Also had to pay $25 a day for a refrigerator.  All in all would definitly come back.
30,"I love this hotel! Very beautiful! Nice decor beautiful rooms and I absolutely loved Eataly! However there are things that need much improvement...The Check-in/Check-out process I didn't like at all. You walk around looking for a front desk that doesn't exist so you end up at a kiosk. The kiosk could not find my reservation and had no idea what to do next? Finally my husband found a security guard and asked how we could check in since the kiosk couldn't find our reservation. We were told to look for a ""Reservation Specialist"" With all the people in the lobby the specialists were very hard to find but we finally found one and were able to check in. When we checked out I wanted to use my Mlife comp. dollars towards my bill. We walked around looking for a ""Specialist"" and could not find one to save our lives so I checked out using the kiosk. However it would allow me to use my comp money so now I have to contact the hotel to try and use the comp money and credit my bill. What a mess!"
50,The location is perfect Food is awesome Atmosphere inviting and you can even catch some of the best shows happening in Vegas in the Park Theater! The park MGM is sure to provide you with a Los Vegas experience you won't soon forget!
50,The room was very clean and the daily maid service was fantastic!  The bed was very comfortable! The hotel itself was very clean and it is centrally located to other area attractions. The FREE tram ride between 2 other hotels was awesome! Just be aware that after you make your reservation there is also an extra resort fee of $41 per night that is charged to you when you check out :( disappointing......
50,excellent venue. Very clean and comfortable. Staff very friendly and accommodating. Stayed because of a concert adult daughter's first time in Vegas. Loved that they had a Starbucks just off the elevators. Did not like that there were no refrigerators or coffee pots in the rooms. But found out this is typical of almost every hotel in Vegas. Also there was a closet (with only a few hangers) but no drawers to put clothes into. All in all it was a good trip.
40,Room thermostat is set to not go below 67 ridiculous. Had to complain several times to get room to a cool temperature. Poolside is great and location is great as well close to everything. Other than that highly recommended
20,Disappointing. I wish that I’d have selected a different place to stay. This place is like the motel 6 of the Strip properties. The pictures on the website are nothing like the property in person. Definitely a dated property.
30,The check-in on the kiosk was okay. Didn't really speed up the process much. In fact was actually more tedious because the computer was slow. The hotel and casino is nice. The rooms definitely have a retro feel. The carpet on our floor could have used an update as it was stained.  The staff was friendly but we really didn't have a lot of interaction with them.
30,I decided to give this hotel a try after reading about the renovation and was disappointed from the moment we walked in. The electronic check in is not as straightforward as one needs on top of it there was only one person to help so that took longer than necessary.    The common areas received a light makeover making them still look dated. The elevators shows its 20 years of age the hallways are dark and dingy the gaming floor looks like it hasn't been touched from the Monte Carlo days. We decided to walk through the connector to Aria and gamble there. You can also take the tram to the Bellagio!    The room was redone and while not big it was nice. The bathroom was a good size with glass enclosed shower. The barn door is a nice idea but when either of us was in the bathroom we would slide the door into the person accessing the closet. The seating in the room was odd. There is a banquet seating along the window with what looks like a dinning room table and a single leather chair. None of which work well when trying to sit at the table. They were going to eclectic and ended up with odd. Last thing about the room the AC constantly shuts off during the night not good to wake up sweating!    We spent 3 days at the pool and the service was nice and not overly crowded although it was Tue-Thur. We had our choice of chairs and the bar service was attentive.    Overall a nice experience given the cheap room but I won't stay here again.
50,The hotel staff was superb and everything was spot on!!!!! All staff was eager to assist and very helpful. The rooms were quiet - no one running up and down the halls or slamming doors. We enjoyed our stay!
10,The rooms are small and uncomfortable. The room was never cleaned and or serviced during trip. We came to Las Vegas for 3 concerts and choose this hotel because of two of them but will never again be staying at this location
20,I would not recommend the Park MGM. As soon as you get to the lobby to check in you have to deal with a computer and NOT a live person. ( BIGGEST TURN OFF) Only live person you talk to are the ones who can help you when checking in on the computer or VIP customers. Didn't like the fact that they make you pay an extra $15 EVERYDAY your parked on their premises but THE ONLY GOOD THING IS; You can use your room key to and from any MGM property to get in and out of their parking garage.
30,Wish the a/c worked better and had more late night dining. The room was clean but nothing fancy. There is no dresser for folded clothing and the ceilings in the hall are incredibly low. We enjoyed the pool area.
40,I reserved a Nomad room back in December 2018 through my M Life offers and when I checked in in June they gave me a Park MGM room with no explanation. I got a hold of somebody to figure out why I wasn't in my Nomad room and they said they had to downgrade me because of overbooking. I go to Vegas often and that is the first time that's every happened to me. My reservation was for a comp and I think they sold it to somebody else who paid for it. Their comped rooms aren't 100% either you have to pay the resort and taxes. I know a lot of places are like this but not at the Wynn they're comps are 100% no money out of your pocket for fees.    Getting back to my ACTUAL stay at Park MGM which wasn't where I was supposed to be in the first place... it was nice. Checking in was complicated and I work in tech. I checked in on my phone but when I went to retrieve my hotel keys at the kiosk the attendant told me the program doesn't always work and I have to check in at the kiosk from scratch. Weird but okay. When I tried to check in it couldn't find my reservation (probably because of the Nomad switch-a-roo they pulled on me) and he had to take over the whole thing to get it. They put us in a Staywell room. The beds were a little worn on the sides that they leaned towards the floor and we had a busted light but the air purifier and lavender? machine was exceptionally great. They also wanted to make sure we noticed the vitamin c shower. I couldn't tell a difference but okay. It's an orange vial filled with vitamin c that connects to the shower head and dispenses with the water. The view from our room faced NY NY's roller coaster which was pretty cool. The location of this casino was great. We didn't realize until the last day that they have an internal pathway to Aria which was AWESOME to stay out of the heat.    Eataly was the best thing at this property. The food was delicious and plenty. I would still like to get into the Nomad room and I don't think I would personally stay in a Park room again (I like to try different rooms/hotels) but I would definitely make the trip to Eataly again.
50,I was reluctant to book a room because I would never stay at Monte Carlo. It was a pleasant surprise. What a great makeover!! I loved the service room and ambiance. It’ll definitely be on my list of hotels to stay at Vegas.
20,The ParkMGM did a nice job renovating the lobby and the theater. That's the best that can be said for this hotel. The room renovations are underwhelming and the ongoing maintenance in the hotel is indicative of the poor management. The location is just average and premium strip view rooms offer little more than a view of the retail locations across the street. Management is confrontational and uninterested in addressing any issues that might arise. With all the selections along the strip we would never choose to stay at ParkMGM again.
30,so very disappointed that there was no room service. especially morning coffee. In Vegas we are all from different time zones. Since I am from the east coast so that made a very early morning waiting on Starbucks to open. Then you had to get dressed go down and stand in line with 20 or more people. Not a good morning experience!
50,stay here!!! smaller and more intimate feel staff is so friendly and helpful primrose restaurant has outdoor courtyard ! pretty and relaxing easy to get around and a great location this was our first stay here and now is our favorite have stayed at all the big name hotels
50,I was very pleased with my stay in the hotel the entire place was clean friendly very well staffed food beverage and casino services were friendly and convenient. The elevator service was prompt hardly ever a wait. I will definitely be back!
40,We spent a long weekend and thought the staff were very helpful and courteous. Decent clean rooms with comfy beds and pillows. They have Eataly which has really great food but we didn’t like the other in house restaurants as much as other casino offerings. They were stingy on the drinks in the casino as we weren’t offered a single drink but barely sat down at the Bellagio and Caesar’s and were offered drinks. We’d stay here again but definitely head to the Bellagio to gamble.
10,"Check-in was a disaster staff was rude. Expect your room to not be ready until 5pm because that is ""real"" check-in time according to the staff. Expect for the room type you booked (and already paid for) to not be available and to settle for an inferior room with no apology or goodwill gesture. Expect your room to be sparse and completely devoid of even the most basic amenities (coffee machine microwave a proper number of towels do not disturb sign alarm clock (or any clock) etc.). Seriously don't stay here."
20,The room has nothing.  No refrigerator  No coffee pot in the room  No mini bar in the room  Asked hot water and they told me it would be $8 for hot water.  If it wasn’t in Las Vegas it is quite understandable. But you know it is totally rediculiois
10,Rooms are old looking and feeling we had multiple issues during our stay. We did not like self check in and check out very impersonal for Vegas. Too few shops casino is very small. Whole property is dark and dated feeling.
20,Our room was not very nice. It looked like an average motel. Nothing luxurious about it just simple. The shower was not sealed properly so it dripped on the floor in the bathroom and several of the plugs around the room were not working.
40,My first time there and I was impressed. Check in was quick and and so was check out. The staff was friendly. Casino was well taken care of. Parking was easy. Overall my stay was great. Would love to stay again.
30,So many hotels in Vegas are plush and over-the-top and we expected it of the Park MGM. But there were a bunch of little blips that just fell short. For example there were no towel bars in the bathroom. There were two robe hooks which we used for towels but what? Another example there was a safe but it wasn't big enough to fit a laptop. We were approved by the front desk for late checkout but then we were locked out of the room. When we went down to get the keys working again they saw on the record that we had been approved for late checkout. None of these things were reasons to not stay here but they also were imperfections that were a surprise for the price we paid. Oh and the pools were small!
30,The hotel has been beautifully remodeled the location is great and it offers nice amenities. However we booked a trip from Wed-Sun and although our first two nights went well the second two nights did not. The walls are incredibly thin so you can hear your neighbors showering talking and even partying. The partying is our biggest complaint. Yes we understand this is Vegas and there's a nightlife that comes with it but we had to have our room moved two times in one night because the people next door had music blasting all night 11pm-4am. I will say the staff did their very best to move us around with no issue but on the last night there we just gave up on even trying to sleep. Long story short if you value a good nights sleep this may not be the hotel for you.
40,"Don't waste your money on ""Early Check-In"" it only means you'll get your before 3pm. I got and flew in in the morning then I ended up waiting almost 5 hours to get my room at 2:47. So I paid extra money for all of 13 minutes. Lame. However that being said the hotel was otherwise really good. Bed was comfortable couch in from of window is so comfy and lux feeling. There was not fridge minibar or microwave so make of that what you will. Eataly is great. Best Friends is delightful. The casino is a good time waiting to happen. If you are in Vegas for Gaga or another Park MGM show it is so convenient and perfect. Haus of Gaga is not to be missed (unless you don't like Gaga in which case go do something else it's fine). The Park Theatre is very nice; I was in the balcony back row and I had a fine view. The acoustics were also great I would definitely go to another show there."
10,Went to the pool. Had three beer each. I went to the washroom and I was trying to walk in the shadow because the ceramic was just too warm. The security guard took me appart thinking I was too drunk. I explained that the ground was just too warm and I was looking to walk on the shadows. The next thing I know he comes around takes our drink and leave saying I am too drunk. I went to see the manager and he offered me two new drinks because he could see I was not drunk. I asked him to talk to the guy with him to understand the situation a little more but he would not let me. He even said trust me it is better if you don’t talk to him. Then the same security comes around again. He still thinks I am too drunk but too be honest his problem is that I am gay. I called him out homophobic which I think he is at this point. The next thing I know this lady manager takes his side and escort us out of the pool. People at the bar did not understand a thing. Lifeguards either. Some even wrote to me on my Instagram to apologize. This is not ok. This should not happen in 2019. Pay some money and go to another hotel if you read this.
40,I really enjoyed this property the location is great the new layout of the rooms facing the window is awesome.  We used some of our reward points to get a couple of complimentary nights but we were sad that we couldn't use some of our reward points because all the deals had blackout dates during the weekends.
10,Bathroom was littered with long dark hair on white tile reported it to the VIP desk and they assured me it would be cleaned. I returned 10 hours later it was till there. Reported it again and the hair still remained.
40,Definitely was not as busy as other hotels when we visited. Not having a ton of people crowding the lobby and casino was lovely. Stayed there because of Lady Gaga's concert at Park Theater. Understandably there was more people in common areas before and after the concert but people flowed in and out.  I loved the fact that there was no scented lobby or casino areas.  Staff was friendly patient and professional. Navigating your way around the hotel was easy. The property was clean.  Self Check-in was pretty quick. I had to get assistance because the computer was acting up but other than that no problems.  The bed in our room was lovely. Pillows were just the right amount of firm. The bathroom was huge. The shower water pressure was amazing.  Many eateries and bars to choose from in the lobby and in the area. Convenience stores are a few doors down and across the street if you don't want to pay hotel prices.  We had a great time and would return!
30,We stayed at the Park because we were seeing Lady Gaga. It was convenient to have dinner at Eataly and attend the concert without leaving the property. But if you aren't seeing Gaga I would recommend looking for another place to stay. The check in process was tedious the rooms were not terribly clean and there were not a lot of shopping/dining options in the hotel (as compared with the Cosmopolitan or the Bellagio which are nearby). There are no coffee pots in the rooms so you have to go downstairs and stand in a LONG queue at Starbucks just to get your morning caffeine fix. The rooms were large but had low ceilings in the bathroom which made you feel like you were in a basement. Odd. There is a free tram that you can take to the Crystal Shops and the Bellagio which should be highlighted more for guests since navigating the Strip in 100+ heat is miserable and the tram is a quick way to get around. In sum it wasn't a terrible place but for the price seemed a little short on comforts/amenities.
30,Newly renovated hotel who inherited the old problem will remain a big concern.  There’s got to be a better resolution. Good luck! Good luck ! More power and best wishes to all who did the efforts of pleasing customers.
50,The hotel rooms are nice and roomy. The staff was extremely friendly and loved the 3 pools they have on the property. The bartenders at the outside pool bar were extremely nice and made you feel at home.
50,Had the best experience at The Park. Friendly staff very clean room and bed was very comfortable. Restaurants were amazing and again staff was friendly and very informative. Can’t wait to book again......
40,Great hotel nice rooms and beds. Wonderful pool area. Great food and bars. Good location and parking access. Friendly staff. BUT...Poor odds and not a great variety of slots. Would stay again and gamble off site.
10,Room was dirty staff couldn’t care less that I was unable to rest due to people next to me. Wouldn’t even talk to them even though they couldn’t hear me on phone due to the noise. Checked out early and couldn’t even get a receipt. Called an agent wouldnt just send the re riot and needed a manager to send a receipt that wasn’t even accurate. Entire experience was the worst ever. Would never return to this property and may switch from MGM resorts all together because of it.
20,Great to see Lady Gaga. Otherwise lousy hotel. Service poor. Got down to the pool at 8 am and they were blasting techno music. Twice asked if music could be changed or turned down and was treated rudely. Like they don’t give a crap what the guests want . There was hardly anyone at the pool at the time. One employee said “well they have a DJ in the afternoon” as if to say “you should leave now if you don’t like it.” The other simply said “We have no control over it” When I asked who does he said. “The hotel”. Rooms are mediocre. No coffee in the room. Eataly is nice but that’s it.
30,Read all the reviews and was pretty scare about the check in process. But it turn out ok. Went to the kiosk and grab the keys and off we went. Did notice the loud music to the pool but it’s pretty normal in Vegas.
40,Check in needs more people then kiosk! And my room wasn’t ready till late late evening !!once I was able to get help he was great to finally chek me in but after a wait if 6 hours ..Rooms are all we Decore and looked smaller then when it was Monte Carlo ! And funky smell kept on coming through the vents it was not pleasent !
20,"This is the second day in a row that I come up to my room after room service had ""made our room"" .To find that the room hadn't been made.The bed was half made and the pillows were off the bed. Yesterday I just made the bed my self. Today the sheets were done.However it seems someone was on the bed  the pillows weren't placed properly. The towels from the bathroom floor hadn't been removed. My items from the night stand had fallen between the stand and the bed.Not sure what's happening here. As someone who comes out to Vegas multiple times a year. And have stayed at many resorts. I expected more."
30,Nothing was exception. The check in was not great had to wait 4 hours for a room. After i called to confirm that i could check in at 12 and they said perfect we'll see you then. After all of that they then charged me an extra $150 for fee and service i never used. Then they charged me $25 for a resort fee. It’s so much of a scam for all that stuff.
40,Stayed at Park MGM to see Lady Gaga the show was super. The hotel was great and it couldn’t have been easier to get to and out of the theater. I liked that the hotel was less crazed that it’s counter parts on the strip.
40,Stayed at Park MGM 6/5 and 6/6 to visit with my BFF and see Lady Gaga. I pre-checked in with my mobile phone and my room was ready when requested. The staff at the check-in kiosk couldn’t have been more helpful and was very nice. I had a king bed room and it was comfortable and clean. The pool area was very relaxing. All staff I encountered were were very nice. My only complaint and it’s a small one is lack of food choices for someone who’s not into Italian or fancy food. Will definitely stay there again.
50,I loved everything about my stay at this hotel. The room was great very clean and spacious. Great hotel location several food options and the staff helped me locate my lost ID which definitely saved my trip! Will be staying here again for sure but I would prefer to check in with a human instead of a self check in (which is where I left my ID!)
50,Very satisfied with my stay room was very clean and was able to check in at 7am. Asked for extra towels and the service was very quick and were very helpful to help me out. My kids loved the casino and pools were clean and service was excellent at the pools as well.
10,Was solicited via email for a stay at Park MGM in Vegas. Offer included Stripview room and $50/night food credit at certain restaurants on its properties. I received neither. The view was of the casino roof and Subway across the street and when inquiring about the dining credit at front desk I was told that I was not eligible because I had not entered a specific code at the time the reservation was made however I was never offered a code nor made aware that I would need one to take advantage of the offer.  Extremely poor communication or false advertising you choose.
40,I have been staying at this property since it was Monte Carlo the pool and the dining were my favorite during that time.  Now that Park MGM my favorite is still the Pool but not the food...  I like simple american food not into fancy. The staff is very good better than before. The beds are not good.  Its a nice place I will return.
50,The hotel room was so very nice. It was spacious with great decor and furniture that made it comfy. The bathroom was perfect size and had ample shelf space for all your toiletries. The mirror options were a dream for makeup application. I particularly loved the hotel main entrance because it wasn’t crazy busy like others. The hotel was easy to navigate and they conveniently had taxi/Uber pick up entrance separate from main entrance. I definitely recommend this hotel as the best “strip” hotel to stay at.
50,"Loved the room with the renovations you have done the resort and pools are awesome you have the tram right there if you want to head to other casinos the food area Eataly is amazing - great options well priced and great food! This hotel is my ""go to"" anytime I am in Vegas!!"
10,Came to conference at this hotel and decided to stay here instead of my usual accommodations. I’m not crazy about the self check in but I could live with that. The rooms are average but don’t expect a fridge to keep your water cold and if you like making yourself a cup of coffee or tea in the AM plan on getting up little earlier to wait in the one register open wrap around line at Starbucks. All of that I could probably excuse but the plumbing situation was just unexceptionable. The 1st room we were assigned was okay for the 1st day. The 2nd day when we came back to the room it smelled like sewage. The smell coming from the shower permeated the entire room. They moved us to another room on a different floor. Day 3 was fine but next day that sewage smell was in the bathroom shower again. I didn’t complain because we were leaving the next morning.
40,Great hotel to stay in if you are attending a concert but if you want plush or elegant go to the Bellagio or Aria which is within walking distance also. Pool area has 3 pools but not very attractive.
10,Automated check-in process was horrible first room smelled like dead fish was told to call the operator to get a new room on hold for 25 minutes before giving up and going down to the VIP desk. Room furnishings are shabby to say the least. Won't stay here again.
10,Check-in was automated therefore a disaster since machines were down or malfunctioning. The entire hotel smelled like smoke including my room. I did not see any non-smoking areas around the pool. People were smoking in the pool as well. The hotel room did not have a coffee maker or a mini-frig. These features are generally found at lower-rated hotels. The room's decor made no sense at all (eyesore). It looked extremely cheap. The signage within the hotel was not accurate or efficient. It sent you in a complete circle instead of a straight line.
50,I stayed at Park MGM las summer and was dissapointed with all the construction that was going on. This year they met all my expectations except for the A/C in the room (not very cold). Staff was friendly rooms were clean great casino play atmosphere great looking pools. I had a great time!!!
50,The decor and over all renovations of this property were done with style and class. The clean yet modern feel of the guest rooms made them welcoming and comforting. Primrose was a lovely both inside and outside seating areas made you feel as if you were enjoying a meal in your own home or in your garden with friends not to mention the food was delious.
20,Disappointed since upgrade to Park from MC. Limited food options of reasonable price. No in room coffee large lines at Starbucks Long walks to restrooms Bar prices seem to have increased a lot ($20 for a vodka red bull)
30,I give MGM props for the vast improvements to the Monte Carlo but it’s mostly lipstick on a pig. Room was nice but wouldn’t cool all weekend. Restaurants were okay; Eataly is very cool. But for the prices there are better places on the strip. Also drivers get very confused whether they’re taking you to the MGM or Park MGM.
20,This was my first trip to Vegas and I chose this hotel because of a performance (I thought it’d be convenient). But there is nothing that is attractive to the young crowd and it’s too loud for the older folk.    The pools are very small and crowded especially compared to how other hotels manage their larger capacities. The casino is average.    There are better hotels available! If I knew better I would not have stayed here.
20,Rooms are nothing to write home about. Very basis without any extras. Low ceilings made it feel a little tight. Machine selection is poor and the machines they did have were not great for us. Mlife was disappointing when it came to comps.
10,I've asked for a room away from the T-mobile Arena cause it was too noisy last year and They gave me the room right front of the Arena.  Worst of all my wife and I wanted to try the restaurant called Primrose on the first floor and we found a human hair from the Primrose cheese burger.  Bad bad experience!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
20,Just spent 12 nights at Park MGM our 14th visit to the property as was previously Monte Carlo. They have done a really good job on the refurb with some outstanding new options including Eataly. What has left a really sour taste in the mouth is that when we left we settled our account in cash at the VIP Services desk and on checking our bank we have discovered that there has been nearly $3000 unauthorized debits taken from our registered card. Despite calling six times today and the promise that the manager of the VIP desk who we paid the cash to would call us back nothing and no reply to emails. Hopefully it is an oversight and it will be fully refunded but hence the review score. Be careful at checkout.
40,Stayed at the Park MGM for three nights and enjoyed every minute. I saw Lady GaGa's ENIGMA show during my stay and the Park Theatre is a beautiful venue and hope she extends her residency so that I can see her Jazz & Piano show next. I only wish that they had given hotel guests some perks to the show like an exclusive entry or some other motivating factor to stay on property.
40,Park MGM is home to Lady Gaga’s Vegas residency. The hotel is just average but it was very convenient to stay at the same hotel. Overall it was a decent stay no complaints. Not compliments either though. The hotel is average but a good value for the money. You can always visit the other hotels for fun.
50,Great overall customer service cleanliness and great selection of food. La La Noodle was my favorite and so was the staff. Room were really nice and clean. My friends that went with us also really liked it.
30,"Park MGM is a challenge. Rooms have NO beverages unless you like tap water. You rent the safe. Room service/turkey avocado club & a bottle of water was $40 before tip and took over 90 minutes to receive! The slots just take w/little payout - no attempt to let you think you're ""playng"".. Poor slow service throughout. Pools and show area are good enough. Thanks to Pierre to for his help with our handicapped person at the Gaga Show"
30,"MGM Park is a boutique kind of place the old Monte Carlo that I have stayed several times in the past refurbished. The rooms are small but workable for one person. Kind of tight for two with luggage. No refrigerator to me is a glaring error. Room was very clean and the redo of the bath was excellent. Great shower no tub. I'lm happy my wife is not (but she was not on this trip--it was a brothers reunion). Staff was very courteous. No real coffee shop another issue. Plenty of good Italian. Beds were excellent. Quiet most of the time some noise from other floors and adjacent but not a problem. Main issue is late checkout. In paying my bill I noticed it was too high. What they did was charge me a late checkout fee for EVERY day I was there. Should only have been the last day. It took time to get that rectified. Was that intentional? Don't know. But I was there for 5 days so I did notice the overcharge. Good location cabs available if just me I would go again despite the negative aspects. If my wife joined me I would not. But don't let that stop you if all you want is a landing pad for some good ZZZs and a good shower. Recreation fee of $40 plus dollars a night was useless for me the facilities and pools should be ""pay as you go."" I would rather apply the $40 on a fridge for the room!!! (an employee told me you can rent one for $45 a night and that is ridiculous in terms of price)--Chuck S."
10,Sulfur smell coming from sink drain. I mentioned it to the front desk and the said someone from engineering would come up to fix it but no one came to address it. My family and I ended up checking out early
40,Other than an automated check in service that was impossible to navigate (wouldn't read my i.d. and no human being available to help as multiple customers stood at kiosks in frustration) the experience was lovely. Quiet rooms decent casino great access to other spots on the strip with the Aria tram right at the hotel
40,Great hotel and casino. I like the convenience of the eatily with its many restaurants. Staff is very friendly and it was a pleasure for my 2nd time stay at Park. I have already made arrangements for a trip in November with family members. Thanks !
40,When I went they were just finishing up the renovations. It was nice then. Bed was comfy room was nice. The staff was really nice and friendly. It was nice to be close to several eating establishments.
20,Some staff in the main restaurant appeared disheveled. Unfriendly and disorganized management policy. When asked about where to go to eat the staff at the front desk had no idea what was open and what was not after 10 pm. Rooms were nice and clean. Check in was inconvenient as you must use kiosks. Fortunately one staff member was hanging around to help.
30,This is the second time I’ve stayed at this hotel. The rooms are nice (2 queen room) and clean. Hotel is easy to get around in and a not bad location on the strip.    Nomad restaurant & bar are both excellent. I was here for a conference and all the food was great conference rooms were nice and clean. Staff was attentive and accommodated our needs.    The pool area is nice there is one main hot tub and 2 pools. Another one looks like it is for Nomad guests.    Car parking was easy ($15 for over 12 hours) paid in the parking garage.    There is a resort fee at this property. I think $35 usd?
40,Water pressure is the best on the strip! This will be our go to hotel when staying in Vegas as it is right in the middle of all of the MGM casinos. Could use more bathrooms on the casino floor. The new eataly is a bit of a cluster during busy times could be organized a bit better.
10,The rooms at Park MGM were dirty and looked like a cheap hotel. The floor wasn't vacuumed the bedding was dirty. The room was on the 9th floor and the music by the pool was so loud that it literally shock the room from 10 am to 6 pm. The check in is terrible and they only had one person on a Saturday doing luggage check. When I finally got a room it took them forever to bring my luggage to my room. When I checked out the automated service was not working. It was one of the worst experiences I have ever had in Vegas.
40,"We picked this hotel specifically because we were attending a concert at the Park Theater and felt it was better to stay on site then fight traffic and crowds to get there and back.    The room was clean and spacious. No dresser or refrigerator however there was a small file cabinet in the closet you could use for the dresser. Safe was decent sized but not enough to fit a laptop.    Didn't understand why with a resort fee we still had to pay for parking use of the business center and one pool. Isn't the resort fee supposed to cover your ""amenities""    Our room was above the pool so every day we were awoke at noon by the loud pool party going on downstairs. A disclaimer when we checked in would have been nice.    Overall the room was nice and spacious in a good location relative to the strip however at an average cost of $200 a night I would have expected a lot more amenities included."
20,Late check in despite pre-check in online. Hot smelly room with an AC that didn't work well. Poorly organized coordination with cleaning staff which bothered us despite late check in and do not disturb sign.
40,We stayed at this hotel for New Year’s Eve and after it has been refurbished and completely revamped from when it was the Monte Carlo hotel I really couldn’t fault it    The rooms were nice and modern clean and a good size... we had rooms people looking to strip which are definitely worth paying for  The hotel has all the usual Vegas facilities plenty of restaurants bars and of course a really good size casino !    Our only disappointment was to have booked their steakhouse for New Year’s Eve about three months before we went yet on arrival at the restaurant we were then told we could only eat from the $150 menu and nothing else was available. They claimed they hadn’t been able to contact us to let us know the normal menu wasn’t available however I had had no emails or telephone calls from anybody and at that late stage we had no option but to eat from that menu    I would definitely choose to stay at this hotel again it’s a really good location on the strip and has everything that you need    The Starbucks café however need to get more staff as the queues were immense all of the time !!
30,average service wait too long for restaurant and the room was noisy could hear techno until 2-3 am both sat and sun nights. The room service was supposed to bring bottle opener and did not answer walkies talkie and so forgot
10,Loved the Park MGM was my favorite hotel on the strip and was always my go to place. Stayed there 3 times before and even lived through the noisy renovations. This last trip my I pad was stolen from my room out of my suitcase. I used the room safe for my other valuables but didn't think I needed to lock-up my Electronics as well.    My major issue is Security and Hotel Management did nothing about it. I contacted security and was told to fill out a claim. I asked them if they could check if some one other than myself keyed into the room. I was told that can't give out that information. In my review to the hotel I mentioned this and a hospitality manager apologized and indicated she was going to escalate this matter to the other department managers. I never heard a word back from anyone and my claim was closed a week later as item not found.. It's a shame because the Park MGM was a wonderful place and the Casino and Pool staff were awesome.
40,Came here last september and was not too impressed. Gave it a second chance and glad I did. Rooms are comfortable and very clean. Layout of hotel/ casino is well done. Don’t miss the Lady Gaga costume exhibit.  This hotel has direct entrance into park MGM theatre. Great place to stay and see show.
10,Stay elsewhere.... I've put all my thoughts and reasons in this evaluation already. Nomad Dj makes it so you can't sleep past 11 when his bass starts pounding. Eataly is overwhelming and the two different things we bought were just okay.
50,I was not a big fan of this hotel when it was the Monte Carlo but now I think they have made some great improvements. It has a outstanding new feel and I loved the EATELY inside. Even if you don't stay at this hotel you should check out Eately.
50,This is the 2nd time staying at Park MGM since the 1st time had a lot of construction going on. Eataly is complete and awesome as well as the casino pools and everything else. Had a great time and everything was very nice about the stay. The showers and water pressure were awesome!
20,I stayed at this hotel several years ago when it was the Monte Carlo and was satisfied with the value at that time. However I was very disappointed this time and will not stay here again. While MGM has put some effort into changing eating options the rooms are is need of updating and more importantly the housekeeping staff needs to be trained in how to clean a room.
30,Cheaply done remodel. Bare bones room..literally nothing in the room. No fridge coffee maker water anything. We only had 2 towels and they were paper thin towels. Like the cheapest ones you could get on amazon type. Best thing about the room was the strong water pressure.
20,Lots of small issues meant the overall stay was lacking. Poor housekeeping ( Dirty drinking glasses broken hair dryer stains on bath walls ) was biggest issue. Automated check in made staying near traveling companions impossible. Food choices on site were very limited compared to adjoining casino hotels. Room design looks great in photos but has limited clothing and luggage storage. The great looking sliding door to bathroom crashes into the spouse looking for clothing in closet or luggage rack. This property was previously the Monte Carlo and when MGM rebranded and renovated it as the Park I expected much more. The new concert venue is great but stay else where.
50,MLife rewards combines with this easy to navigate and enjoy property makes for a perfect quick getaway  Went for work and was able to add one day here. I love that Starbucks is it right at the elevator Same with the pool. I hat having to walk through casinos in swimsuits. Great property
10,"Always ""running low"" on towels at pool. Each family member has to show up at towel counter to be allowed ONE TINY towel. Towels have to stay there so bring a towel from your room if you don't want to freeze on your way back to your room. Mattresses very uncomfortable. They are dipped at the ends and not very soft. Walls are very thin. You can hear your neighbors' conversation."
50,"My friends and I enjoyed a ""girls trip"" to Las Vegas with our central activity was Lady Gaga's Enigma. The property is new and ALL the employees were positive and helpful at every turn. We could not have had a better time. Lady Gaga was unbelievable - what a SHOW! - and our location on the strip was central to most of our other activities."
10,Booked three rooms as a gift to my niece who just got married. Her first time in Vegas and I wanted to wow her. There were many other hotels cheaper than this one  but after reading it had just been updated  I thought it would be modern. Wow. It felt like a 60s hotel  So I asked to move to another mgm hotel. Desk staff were very unhelpful . Smirking at us because the room was not nice enough for us and we were told  you shouldn’t come to Vegas if you want a nice room  or go and stay at the Waldorf. We moved to the bellagio and had a great room and great service
10,Reserved and paid for an accessible room Was given a regular room by mistake. They did not offer to fix that problem only give a resort fee refund. So as a Handicap person I could not take a shower or use the bathroom sink or use the toilet as there were no bars next to it. Completely unacceptable If your here to see a concert just spend the night somewhere else!!
50,Nice place to stay staff is friendly the rooms were clean and new great shower and some good places to eat plus the casino was nice location is good right by the park and t mobile arena plus there is a tram stop at this location
10,Staff was not friendly and helpful. The self service computer most were out of order room was not ready and when it was you need to go through the entire check in process all over again in order to get your room keys. Our shower drained really slow so your taking a shower in pool of water. Would not recommend this hotel at all.
50,We loved the location and the convenience of the Park MGM. It has a nice tram that goes to 2 other hotels including the Bellagio. The room was spacious and very clean . Great internet and large bathroom. Many eateries close by outside the hotel. Eataly was nice place to eat and we had a good pasta meal at one of the restaurants there. Would recommend to all.
40,Nice hotel. Easy self checkin.  Clean  Rooms - bathroom nice and has been updated.  Beds very comfortable. Pillows nice.  Rooms decorated old Vegas style but the red couch and old leather chair need to go.  Staff very nice and helpful when you need them.  Housekeeping great!  The Italian Eatery looked amazing but we did not eat there.  Starbucks conveniently located by the guest elevators  Very easy to get around the casino.  Pool area nice and located to the left of the guest elevators.  Staff at pool excellent . We ordered drinks and food very good service and food was very good. Recommend the nachos or the chicken strips.  Checkout easy from your room on the TV.  Would definitely return to this hotel.  Location was good but depends on where you prefer to be on the strip.
50,Everything was Excellent. I would love to shout this from the roof top. The room was very clean and smelled great. The staff was very friendly and helpful. I will definitely recommend this hotel to all
10,You're still at the Monte Carlo...the rebranding looks impressive from the street--but inside and the rooms it's Lipstick on a Pig...and NOT a pretty color.  What a disappointment. Room should be $59. MAX
20,We were so excited to stay and this was our first time since the turnover from Monte Carlo. It was a huge disappointment. Staff was unresponsive. Resort fee was charged and not even a cup in the room to get water. Room was loud at night also.
20,We chose this hotel because we were attending a concert at the Park Theater but view it as a mistake. Casino reeks of cigarette smoke and it’s a long walk through to get to elevators. Room design is poor for two people—lack of luggage/clothing space and opening bathroom door blocks closet area and vice versa. Housekeeping is sloppy and dining choices in the hotel are sparse and not very interesting. In short with so many better choices in Las Vegas pick another property.
50,My wife and I stayed 5 nights at the Park MGM for our honeymoon in Vegas. It was worth every penny spent. The staff is great. Self Check In is very easy. Food selection was right up our alley.    The concierge staff bends over backward to help you find anything you need. Use them for sure on your trip.    Also something we did not think about upon booking but we will remind all in the future - ride share (Uber/Lyft) is much easier at the Park than it was at many other strip hotel we stopped at along the way.
50,Love the location. Located right in the middle of the strip. Great food section at the restaurant. Stayed here for the Lady Gaga show.Easy access to the theater. Really fun place to stay. Would stay again .
30,Hard to rate. We came to Vegas to see this show with advance tickets. Lady Gaga is a talented singer and musician. I enjoyed her music but not the dialogue with the big screen space person. The show started (35 min late) with lots of F this and F that. It was unfortunate that a mother attending with her two dressed to the nine girls approx 10/12 felt she needed to take her kids out. She paid a lot of money for those tickets. That segment added absolutely nothing to the show. I had ear protectors and still it was ear breaking LOUD! She did a little political chat which I could do without as I have no interest in her politics and wasn’t paying to hear her opinions. More wasted time. I don’t think the show was worth the cost for me. Maybe I just would enjoy her piano/jazz show better. I like to hear her sing and play. The choreography was soso... she is not a dancer although she has lots of energy. Her strength is singing and playing. Seating is good in the theatre... lots of height between rows so you don’t get stuck looking at anyone’s head in front of you. You do have to suffer through standing wannabes thinking they are virtual Gagas. Probably any seat is a good seat between the seating and the big screens. In retrospect I would skip this particular production for the price. A diehard fan may feel differently. All in all the show was weird/odd.
40,The Park MGM is located next to the T-Mobile arena right on the strip. The room was clean and had all conveniences. The hotel has 3 pools which are clean and in the sun all day. There is also an exclusive pool for pool parties. In the hotel there is plenty of slot machines and tables if that’s what you want and plenty of bars. We also found it among the cheapest to stay out of strip hotels
50,The area was perfect! It’s located perfectly in the strip and In walking distance to everything. The room was clean and comfortable. Everything is simple to navigate on this casino. I love how elegant it is too. My stay was pleasant! I will be returning!!
40,We enjoyed our stay at the Park. Very clean and a bit more relaxed and quiet when compared to other casino hotels. Dining at Eataly is a must! The hotel staff was outstanding. We will stay here again as the location was convenient with the free tram to the Bellagio.
10,I was given a dirty room with trash everywhere it was not cleaned prior and when I was given a new room I had to go back down a second time because the key to the new room did not work. It took me half an hour to finally get to my room I was extremely tired me and my mother had driven hours and the whole process was very frustrating. The whole hotel looked very run down even with it being remodeled it was obvious it wasn’t completely new the carpet looked old and dirty and the adjacent rooms that were once connected were only separated by a thin wall we could hear everything that was going on in the other room. We will not be returning to Park MGM and do not recommend it to anyone there are so many better hotels for the same price and location.
30,I phoned VIP services with Park MGM before we arrived to inform them that i had a few people in our party that had never been to Vegas before & wanted to make their first stay memorable. Vegas is known for making everyone feel like a special guest.  Nothing was done for them... No champagne no chocolates no nice note card or sign... Nothing  I expected more from a Hotel of this caliber...
50,Always enjoy stay at the Park. We love the easy check-in and restaurants are always good. Rooms and hotel are very clean. My only issue which is personal are the pillows. Both my wife and myself have trouble using them.
50,Once before was Monte Carlo again stayed in the same hotel just now upgrade name and building it was fantastic 👍. Amazing staff and welcoming as well 🙌. Definitely recommend staying there for a relaxing weekend . Also played in the Table min 10 for Black jack was great! Love MgM Resorts parking as well that was a huge perk!!!
10,The stay was not pleasant at all. We didn’t receive a room until 3pm. When we got the room it smelled like cigarettes. The security told us we were making to much noise. I didn’t like the stay at all.
40,Great stay however there were dirty sheets on my bed. They have excellent shows in the theater. The location is ideal right smack in the middle of the strip. Lots of food and gaming room. And the club inside was nice. Would recommend to budget conscious travelers.
50,This was a surprise birthday vacation trip for my fiance. We were extremely pleased with this hotel. Check In was one of the most pleasant experiences ever. It was fast easy and there were someone plenty of employees to help you alone with the process if needed. The entire hotel was gorgeous. I would definitely recommend all restaurants in the hotel it was absolutely splendid. My fiance and I would highly recommend the restaurant la la noodles the made or dining experience exceptional and they also helped me celebrate my fiance's birthday
40,The hotel is clean and new. Pool is great. They need more cocktail servers there. Eataly and the Noodle shop were great! Bavettes is way too dark inside and Primrose needs more selections on their menu. Everything in this hotel closes way too early. Only bar open late screams music way too loud. Very accessable to the Park Theater
50,Comfortable hotel great location great shows. Caught the Lady gaga show was amazing.    Staff is very helpful Starbucks location in main lobby of casino.    Stayed at MOD tower was very happy about it. Will be back again soon.
50,This hotel is the best value services are excellent rooms clean and spacious. Bed super comfy. Second time staying here and each time has been consistently exceptional. Used my Mlife rewards which paid for room buffets etc!
40,Came here for birthday trip and didn't disappoint. Food pool room view show was amazing. Only complaint was all the smokers. What happened? I was here about 20 years ago and there was limited to very little smoking in most of the higher-end casinos. They put them in their own section. I would have gambled more if I could have gotten away from all that disgusting cigarette smoke.
20,We booked into the MGM with our young adult children for 4 days. To see Lady Gaga for two shows and met with the concierge to book reservations for dinners for three nights.It struck us how uninformed he was about the restaurants in the hotel but okay he printed us menus and we got our reservations.We told him we were looking for midrange pricing as we were a fairly large group.We got a surprise our first night as menu we were given by the concierge was not the menus we were given at the restaurant..there was nothing on the menu for less than $135 for steak and fish were $95.Wines were $$$$$. Many of the entrees were $300 -$500 .We packed up and walked out.Lesson learned.I have to say I have never walked out of a restaurant before.Quite embarrassed and angry at the hustle of the hotel or poorly trained concierge.Bad form for building customer loyalty.
50,I had a great time at the Park MGM! I ate at Best Friend on my last day and the food was spectacular! I also frequented Eataly for items like gelato paninis and espresso. I would definitely recommend this hotel.
50,loved the prime location. everything was right there shops dining all of it. rooms were great.staff was excellent. I would definitely book again. check in process was a breeze. Clean up to date rooms.
10,We were in Vegas to see Lady Gaga so we decided it would be good to stay at The Park MGM for the four nights since it would be convenient and it had been recently remodeled. The first (and only) night we stayed there we had a few issues: the shower drain wouldn't drain the blinds were impossible to open/close the AC wouldn't get cold enough even if you adjusted it down there was a long LONG hair on the towels the light switch next to the bed was broken and the room didn't have basic amenities like mini-fridge/bar work desk etc. I did think the bathroom was nicely designed but they didn't include body wash just one bar of soap to use for both the sink and shower. It was just really disappointing in general based on the expectation I had up front knowing that it was remodeled rebranded new and improved etc.    I called offered to pay money for a nicer room even and was told that wasn't possible. Rather than apologize or try to find a solution they couldn't help me. So I decided to check out early and I booked at another hotel. That was money that could have stayed at the Park MGM hotel. I also shared this feedback with a floor supervisor he made sure I wasn't charged for the one night (which was appreciated). I just wish someone could have taken ownership and resolved the issue or come up with some type of alternative. I won't be coming back to The Park MGM ever again.
50,We love the location being next to Aria and New York with lots of dining options plus close to tram to Bellagio. Room was very clean snd love the window seat. We didnt care for the Eatery because of the high prices.
30,On top of the cost of stay they will charge $42 on resort fees PLUS resort fee tax of almost $8 for each day of your stay.    Apparently this is for all of Vegas hotels. Park MGM if you want to stand out from the rest only charge the fee ONCE instead of each day.
30,The price was right for my stay at this hotel. The rooms and the cleanliness not so much. I like this hotel. It has one of the best locations on the strip. When you stay here you can walk to all of the MGM properties and take in a show. Also T Mobile Arena is right next door. This hotel used to be The Monte Carlo. It has been remodeled. Some of the new things about it are nice. There are a few good restaurants here that are really good and the new Sports Book is nice.
50,When I had an issue with my room they quickly upgraded me and appologized. The food was high quality and very good. They have three pool areas plus the NoMad pool which is nice if you want to get away from kids playing.
50,Im giving Park MGM 5 stars for a few different reasons. We usually stay at the Venetian and on our last day before a flight we book random hotels on the strip to relax and shower before our red eye flight back home. Last August we booked Park MGM just to see how it was even though they were still remodeling and we liked it although we didn't sleep overnight in the room the overall experience was great. This month me and some family came to Vegas and stayed at Park MGM for a few nights and they did not disappoint. The staff were very friendly and personable the rooms are nice and the shower is great. The hotel in general has a nice crowd everytime I come to Vegas the hotel is not too loud and the crowd is a respectful type. When you pay for parking it allows you to go to other MGM properties and not have to pay for parking which is a very nice feature. Eataly was a disappointment though I thought there would be more to it and a variety of stuff but almost every other thing was the same. Overall Park MGM is a great property I really don't understand all the negativity I hear and see about the property.
40,Nice recently remodeled premises. Subdued and minimalist decor. Arrived Saturday of memorial weekend. Premise fairly quiet for Las Vegas standards. Rooms really quiet and relaxing. Enjoyed the window seat sofa and taking in the T Mobile views and mountain range. Cons of trip. The self serve kiosks are AWFUL!! Arrived with total chaos of approximately 50 people trying to locate just one working tablet. Only two staff members were working the floor with no organized line formation. Also note if more than two keys are needed have all keyed at same time. We required (3) but could only receive (2) at the self serve kiosk. The other (1) keyed by a staff member became the only working key. Required another visit to the front desk later that night.  Only disappointment for the room no furniture with drawers on main floor. A cabinet in the closet does have two drawers but it became the snack space.
50,Good location not too crowded or loud. Rooms were good clean hallways were a bit dark but nothing major. Pool casino stores restaurants and bars we visited were all good. The concert in Park Theater was also great! great seats. I had a great time and will be back!
20,Arrived late in the evening after flying in from London and was really tired. The automated check-in process didn't work for me it couldn't scan my Swedish passport and there was no error message on the machine and no people to help you. I went up the the VIP desk who kindly checked me in and that went well. My room (I only stayed one night) was not clean I found several 6 or 7 long strands of black hair in the bathroom. In a rush so no time to make a complaint and just had them email me the bill. The only good place in the hotel was the breakfast room where I had a plain omelette small plate of fresh berrier a coffeee and a juice for $54 oh boy. Never staying at this place again.
20,Received bug bites overnight. Reported to management. They switched our rooms. Second room had stains on the linens. No compensation given for bug bites. Cleanliness is questionable from couch to bed. Took 1 - 2 hours to receive items requested such as blankets and bed sheets
20,Fully automated from check in to check out You do not need to talk to anyone and trying to find someone to resolve issues is a challenge. It my be the new wave but I was not impressed. As a Vegas Casino and hotel lacks class and style. No staff to communicate with and those you do are far from enjoying their jobs. Rooms are stark dark and small. 4 walls and a bed minimal comfort. The fact is there are a lot better places to stay. We would not wast our time nor money here.
10,On May 19 2019 my wife and I checked into the Park MGM Las Vegas. We chose the hotel because we were there for the Janet Jackson concert and the theater is a part of the hotel. We were extremely disappointed with the hotel's appearance. They have this extremely thick green rug on each floor and when moving your luggage it was like dragging the bags through mud. One of the bellman stated the hotel had to literally shave the carpet down because it was so thick (idk if that's accurate). The overall design and aesthetics of the hotel are very poor by Las Vegas standards. On May 20th housekeeping didn't arrive until approximately 3:30pm. She knocked on the door entered and simply exchanged the towels and left the room. My wife and I were wondering if she was returning she never came back. The following day housekeeping again arrived after 3:00pm and again she entered the room changed out the towels and never returned. On our final day to check out housekeeping knocked on the door at 11:00am to clean the room. We have never stayed at a hotel where the housekeeping staff just did not complete basic cleaning of a room. I would not stay at the hotel again nor would I recommend it to friends or family Las Vegas has several other hotel options where you can get your moneys worth.
50,Rooms were very clean beds comfortable nice view and neat artwork in the room. Restaurants were good service and food was exceptional! Staff was helpful when I had issues with my Mlife card. Check in was the only downside. Room was not ready even well after check in time.
50,Recent stay for a wrestling event at the MGM Grand across the street. Can safely say that I have been satisfied with each of the MGM-branded sites as I have stayed as the Grand Signature and now the Park. Despite the current construction the actual hotel/resort area was very nice and well-designed with an aesthetic revolving around minimalism and nature that was greatly appreciated. The design of the central hub for each hotel floor for example created a beautiful illusion where you faced a park window every time you walk towards the elevator from your room. The gym is well stocked and up-to-date. The rooms embrace a minimalism that is a nice contrast to the excess that is the strip. Having Eataly as your primary food court option will certainly please taste buds and appetites. And the various pools made this stay very relaxing and helped with crowd/pool control. Would definitely come back.
40,Myself and my husband have been visiting Vegas yearly for the last 6 years. We like to try a different hotel each year and this year chose the Park MGM. Normally there is just the 2 of us but this year it turned into a family gathering with our grown up kids and there partners plus some friends. We have had a fabulous time !!  We arrived on a Saturday afternoon and checked in very quickly we had a few issues with the self check in but the Park MGM had staff available straight away to assist. The rooms are lovely clean and of a goods size. My only criticism would be the lack of drawer space and very little space to hang clothes. Our son and daughter law got married while we were in Vegas and we struggled to hang all our wedding clothes !! The bathrooms are of a good size and towels are plentiful. We heard very little outside noise from the corridor's or other rooms. The casino is fun and never got too busy tried our hands at Craps and Roulette. This year we joined the M life reward's as we had been playing the My Vegas App. The M life staff at the Park MGM couldn't have been more helpful showing us how to benefit from our cards and also re-issuing me with a new card several times when I left my card in one of the machines !!!!! All in all we had an amazing time at the Park MGM and would highly recommend. We would like to give a big shout out to the guy who sorts the taxi's (with the whistle) on our journey back to the airport he arranged a shuttle for us so we could all travel together and it turned out to be a Party Bus. What a great way to end our holiday.
40,Overall I liked the hotel. The corridors are kinda dark and the room we stayed in was kinda small. Didn’t like the farm door that provides privacy for the bathroom that doubles for a door for the closet and mini wet bar. The door doesn’t lock. The staff in the casino disappears at times when you’re searching for drinks. The pool was nice the restaurants were really good. Breakfast and dinner at the Primrose was nice. Eataly is wonderful. Will return.
30,the renovations is over and the casino and hotel are nice. trouble is they are not catering to their old clientel. it's the younger 30's crowd that's getting all the attention. living out of their back packs and coolers.
50,I wanted to try a new hotel and luckily Park MGM was opened (I know it was the old Monte Carlo before) so we decided to book our stay with them. The moment we walked in we knew it was going to be a great stay. We had some issues with self check in but one of your staff was amazing and helped us figure out the problem ( I wish I remembered her name she started our trip off fabulously). With our $150 food credit in tow it was time to go to our room. We reserved a nighthawk suite it was the first room when you get off the elevator which I thought would be a issue but will discuss more later. The rooms across the hall were still being rennovated so our floor was kinda empty which was fine with me. Our room was clean I looked over everything because in the past we have not been so lucky with clean hotel rooms. After inspection we unpacked and started our vacation.  Staff was great everyone we encountered was so friendly we had a great time talking to each individual. Our towels were always repleneshed our food always delivered warm and delicious. We did not hear our neighbors or anyone in the halls which was fantastic. I thought I would hear the elevators all night but it was so quiet I was relieved.  The location was not bad we had no trouble going from hotel to hotel....a CVS was located just across the street so we got our snacks and water bottles from there.  I keep telling everyone who wants to visit to stay here we enjoyed our time here....  the only con I have is the bed....it was hard to get comfortable I am not used to sleeping without a boxspring so maybe they can be added in the future????    Will be planning to stay here again soon
20,Very small room for Vegas style no coffee maker and not even in room refrigerator with fee based drink. Super thin walls can hear next door guest talking flash down the toilet and even pull up and down their curtains.
10,Very basic. Walls are paper thin and you can hear everything. Check in and check out is all on kiosks. No personal attention. Room was dirty and not vacuumed. No affordable restaurants and no buffet. Too many kids for a Las Vegas resort.
50,Spent 3 days at the Park MGM. Location was perfect. In the middle of everything. The self checkin was chaotic but manageable. Clean rooms great beds but could hear other guest doors close. No tv noise from other rooms though.
10,I booked 2 rooms with my Mlife card. We drove all the way from FresnoCA just to be told at the check-in kiosk (after we paid in full at 5:20pm) that my 2nd room was not ready!! 2 couple with only 1 room?! How was that possible for 1 room NOT to be ready?? It's was 5:20PM!! It was EMBARRASSING that I had to tell the other couple that their room wasn't ready but we will be getting a text notice. We all tried to make the best of it but we had 9pm show tickets to Pitbull and needed to all get ready! I waited for the text and once 6:30pm hit I was hunting for a hotel front desk human to speak with... Tanisha at the VIP desk was most helpful but somehow our card was ran twice and we had 2 pending charges >$1000 instead of 1 for $585. Then I was told my 2nd room WAS ready and NOT 1 text came to me.....WILL not be staying again. I can not trust Park MGM with my time. Nobody seemed to care to offer anything to help smooth their mistake.
50,"Approx 10 mins from the airport we got an uber just over 13 dollars. Check in is self serve and easy to navigate. The room was spacious with a king size bed and strip view. 50"" TV. Seating area and large table. Bathroom was a good size but if you like a bath the bath was small. No tea or coffee facilities in the room but you can take your own and buy a kettle. The hotel had a casino theatre shops. The pools are really lovely plenty of sunbeds towels available and there is free water and ice if you all for bottled water is 7 dollars. The location was excellent and there is a free monorail to the shops. We would definitely recommend this hotel."
50,Stayed here with the wife for memorial day weekend prices were great rooms were super quiet beds were amazingly comfortable. All hotel staff I encountered were helpful and friendly. Location was perfect plenty of places to eat especially Eataly.
50,There are many good hotels in LV the Park MGM has to be up there. We had a 6 night stay and found the room and facilities excellent. Cleanliness was excellent. Logistically good to get up and down the strip. Price of the rooms was value for money. Having many places to eat located in the hotel was handy. Convenient for the tmobile arena and the shows available in the park theatre was top class.(gaga/aerosmith/Janet Jackson) multiple swimming pools including a adult only pool was all available for guest use. A gym was available with a great range of equipment. Will be staying again soon.
40,First time staying here. It was for business and pleasure. The hotel was nice. I loved the bar/lounge Juniper. The club On the Record was great too. The only complaint is the room accessories. No place to put extra clean towels (like a shelf or rack) so they were on the sink counter which was small. Because there's no shelf the blow dryer was in the hall closet. No area for the ice bucket and glasses so they were in the closet too. Otherwise it was a nice room and hotel.
50,Service and was great! I came here last year also and stayed at the park mgm! I stayed here again because of the great service! The location can not be better either! It is easy to come into the property now that Eataly is open
40,The pictures on the website do not do the rooms justice. The rooms are NICE! Customer service - excellent. Great location!  The only reason I didn't rate higher was there were few if any vegan options and the casino was really smoky on Sat night.
10,I booked and paid a deposit 5 days prior to our stay and completed a pre check-in they sent to me via e-mail the day prior with my estimated arrival time. Check-in process is a an area if touchscreens with no one in sight to help. The touchscreen stated that our room was not ready and they would text us when it was. We had all of our plane luggage and it was adter 11:00PM. We went to the bell desk who directed us to the VIP desk where we stood in line with lots of other guests and waited for 30 minutes before a staff member with a tablet walked by and said VIP desk was closed. Some other staff would pass by without helping and would tell people to go hang out at their bar to pass the time until their room was ready. We were finally able to flag down a tablet staff member Bianca who told us there was no guaranteed check-in time. So if you're hoping to check-in to a room you're paying for before 11:00PM it's a gamble I guess.    The room itself does not have a fridge or mini bar. There are 2 shelves to put clothes in if you can find it hidden in the closet under the safe. The TV is on the wall perpendicular to the bed so ot's awkward trying to watch TV from bed. The only thing nice about the room was the shower which had good water pressure and consistent temperature.    I thought this MGM property would be worth a shot because it's more accessie to the strip than the rooms in the other MGM but I would never stay here again or recommend this hotel to any friends or family.
50,The place is clean love their new selection of food at eataly friendly staff good location perfect for any show you’ll want to see definitely will be back and will stay there again. Thank you for your hospitality
50,The park mgm is GREAT! We loved everything about the hotel! Keep up the great job MGM! We enjoyed the diverse selection of casino games the many restaurants to choose from as well as the good availability in shows. If your looking for a great hotel great food and great location you must stay at the PARK MGM!
40,Excellent location on the strip clean room comfortable bedding good staff service. Smoke was as annoying don't gamble but had to pass by the casino. I recommend this hotel because the location is in the middle of the strip so you can enjoy both north & south ends.
10,Rooms were old and smelled like pot. The Bed was terrible. I woke up each morning with a sore back. No fridge. Shades were old. I could hear neighbors all night long. Luckily it was close to other good hotel/casinos.
10,What a dump! We stayed here because they said it was newly renovated. Not at all. Run down hotel. Has a bad smell to the place and feels like a bad motel. It’s also not exactly on the strip as you go back a very long drive. Their view rooms are pretty far from strip. Would not stay here again.
30,Since this opened up I really wanted to try it out but learned I’d never stay here again. It wasn’t extremely horrible however for the price I expected more. The check in experience was through a computer which I understand is for the convenience however my confirmation number through a third party isn’t the same confirmation through the hotel so I had to flag someone down. She seemed annoyed to be stopped. We checked in an hour after check in time and found out our room wasn’t available and had to wait for another 15 mins. There was no fridge in the room. The room itself was nice but I’d never stay again.
50,Great location extremely friendly and helpful staff and Bavette's Steakhouse is my favorite meal in Vegas to date. Spotty automated checkin terminals and a poor floor plan for them left something to be desired on busy Memorial Day weekend but otherwise a delightful experience. Not the top-of-line luxury if the MGM Grand but an affordable alternative.
10,There is only self check in here. Nobody to welcome you to the property no human contact. The check in is where you get a first impression of how your stay is going to be. This automatically puts a bad taste in my mouth. How am I to ask for an upgrade or a perk? To make matters worse the self check in didn’t work well. It could not read my ID. I waited 10 minutes for someone to come over and address this issue. She didn’t say two words to me either because she had 6 other people with check in problems waiting as well. Room was tacky due to wiring running up the wall and ceiling to a light that was clearly an afterthought after the remodel was done. The shower was the worst I have ever had in Las Vegas. No water pressure and the spray from the shower might have had a 3 inch radius. A spray nozzle on a garden hose would have showered me better. In order to open and close the curtains you had to pull a medal chain up and down. Every time the people on either side of your room opened or closed their curtains you heard it. I will not stay here again.    On a side not “Eataly” was very nice and with checking out. It was the only thing that saved Park MGM from getting no rating at all.
50,Love coming to vegas as often as i can ive been coming to park mgm formerly monte Carlo for abour 10 to 11 years i will continue to stay there as long as iam able to get around i started staying there when i was about 40 years old.so you know the rest.
20,Room was small but decent. No frig or coffee make which was really a bummer. Decor was vintage which was not what I was expecting. Nice variety of restaurants. Pool was too packed for us everyday so we didn't even bother trying to get a spot. Our check-in agent was the only person the entire stay that took the time to help us and answer questions. Other than that when I asked for a different room because the private pool party music was insanely loud I was told there were none available. When we went to sit at the bar several different time through out the trip the bartenders gave you a drink but no conversation and always had to ask for another instead of them offering. Try to make small talk casino convenience store cashier and he was just plain rude and blew me off. Our check out amount was incorrect and because in was early in the morning no one was available to help us check out. Just not a good experience.
40,Stayed for the Memorial Weekend at Park MGM and it was Good but the House keeping and Room service is Poor  when we asked for Toiletries it never came after reminding them twice.  After we actually asked the Housekeeper who was cleaning the rooms and she said she is requesting the supplies sent to the room but it never arrived.
40,Was a fun trip the rooms were nice and comfortable the machines played nice and had good service at bars..would like to see a few more places available to eat for breakfast or maybe a late night meal.
10,The service is getting worse here overall! I don't know how to help but you guys need to make sure the waitress are asking for drinks on slots too. My wife sat of slots for hours and loss more than 2k on slots. The least she can get is some complementary drinks!
20,A new paint job and some new restaurants only go so far. This hotel needs more consistent training and someone to check on the rooms- plumbing and electrical issues should be addressed before the guest encounters them- but based on multiple manager's reactions it's not a priority. Feels like there is a mix of happy new staff members and sour old timers but there is definitely some bad attitude at this property. No need for a second visit here.
50,We enjoyed our stay at the Park MGM Grand Hotel. From valet to Front Desk to Housekeeping very friendly and well trained staff members made you feel comfortable. Nice Casino and the Theatre is amazing...loved seeing Janet Jackson at this venue. Will be back again!!
30,I stayed at the Park MGM because some friends and I came to Las Vegas to see Janet Jackson’s Metamorphisis show at the Park Theatre. The show was AMAZING! And I was blown away by her performance. However the hotel is just okay. I wouldn’t stay at the hotel if it weren’t for the concert. The self check in was less frustrating as people described in other posts. I actually didn’t mind that part. Our room was UGLY. I’m not sure who designed it but they do not have any taste at all. The room is not very practical either. As 3 girls we had no counter space in the bathroom for our stuff and no dresser to keep our belongings in.  The Casino was just blah. The pool area was nice. But the dumbest thing ever was Jemma the pool party club they have. You had to be on a list to get in and then pay if you wanted a lounge chair.  Also dumb was the entry process to On The Record again even as a hotel guest you have to be on a list.  Aside from the concert I did also enjoy my breakfast at Primrose.  This place has no flair it isn’t your typical vegas. I recommend for concert goers and maybe corporate business groups. NOT recommended for girls trips or bachelor parties or anybody cool or fun.
10,Awful experience in the Park MGM mean room ( barely clean) mean staff queues for everything meaning to miserable to put on staff. Had to almost beg for a bar of soap nowhere to have a reasonable priced breakfast I left early to go to another hotel as couldn’t stay the whole time booked and then there is the outright cheek of the resort fee. The only positive was the pools were good unfortunately it wasn’t warm enough during my stay to use them.
20,When you read the reviews here about noise I know what you're thinking. This is Vegas come on! Who complains about noise in Vegas! I thought the same trust me.    But literally on the *13th* floor Saturday night it sounded like there was a club directly under our room until almost 4am. We could not believe it and could not sleep through it. And we like clubs and staying out late! This really was pretty unbelievable.    This was our second stay at Park MGM having been comped through Mlife the first time but our first on the weekend. So the noise was new.    Otherwise the hotel is a pretty straightforward Vegas property with a lot to like and some warts of the old Monte Carlo that still bleed through The remodel is a bit disjointed with highly-designed and contemporary public spaces but basic rooms and an uninteresting casino that lack any design through-line from the former. But some great restaurant offerings and excellent service from any staff we talked to.    We were very disappointed that the NoMad restaurant is now closed for breakfast. Breakfast here was a highlight of our first visit. More interesting food and an environment more conducive to business than Primrose. Even as we might have considered a return during the week this closure is probably a deal-killer.
30,Strangest floor plan of any hotel in recent memory. With a bathtub located next to the bed a toilet where the door to what should be an adjoining room is located and the shower located on the opposite side it was just a strange layout no matter how you sliced it. While they tried to make it a boutique type hotel it seems not as stylish as other destinations. When you come to Vegas this isn’t the type of hotel you seek out if my mind. On the plus side of the coin the casino is small and manageable. Other than that it is just the old Monte Carlo remodeled and rebranded.
20,Check in is horrific; needs serious upgrading to comply with MGM Resort standards. New on the strip so might just need to work out the kinks. There are no dressers in the room and only like five hangers so prepare to live out of your luggage. Only one rack to share so your luggage will be on the ground too.
40,MGM just got done remodeling what use to be the Monte Carlo and rebranded to Park MGM. Part of the walk between the Aria and into Park MGM almost reminded me of the Bellagio. They could have made the remodel a little more original but it's night and day from where it was. Couldn't tell you about the rooms but with as busy as it seemed I'm sure people are pleased.
20,Very minimalistic rooms not even a dresser in room. Difficult to find staff at check in area during evening hours. The closet was only a half closet. No mini bar in room. Not even a bottle of water for purchase. Would not recommend.
30,This hotel is the old Monte Carlo. The staff was pleasant but the hotel was disappointing. They tried to fix it up but missed the mark! hallways were dark and dingy and the rooms were very low budget. I imagine that if you are traveling on a budget this may work but for a couple of bucks more i could have stayed at any of the hotels on the strip!
30,It was okay it wasn’t the best but not the worst They could be more organized upon Check in and more thorough about hidden fees like additional deposits and thing of that nature. Overall. I would say this is a average hotel stay with a 3 star above average quality and service. It’s nice and cheap for what you pay it’s also close to a lot of things on the strip and attractions are walking distance or a cheap Uber away! If you want a cheap medium quality place true 3 star this is your hotel! Don’t come here expecting better than 3 stars. The pools and bar are nice and I liked the variety of food choices at and around the hotel. It is a 100% smoke free and vape free hotel this was a definite perk. Seems to me a rare commodity anymore. The fact that none of the rooms are smoking is a big reason I chose this hotel!
50,If you ever need a place to stay in Vegas make sure you stay at the park Mgm my stay for edclv was here at the park Mgm and the only thing I can say is it was awesome and amazing! staff were nice the best rooms were awesome!
40,Like the remodeled room. Smart simple rooms and at a relatively good value. Guests are now required to register at a kiosk- put the in my ID - Fail put in my registration # - Fail then the one host on duty assisted and could of not been nicer. Could not put me in the King bed as reserved so waived the (ridiculous) Resort fee. Be sure to check out the new Eataly area and you won’t be disappointed.
40,Not A Bad seat in this venue; I sat in the  -300 section  -200 section &  -Frontrow    Sound system was FANTASTIC even in the front row and my video recordings sound great on playback. Looking forward to returning.
50,The room was very spacious beds comfortable but soft. The shower pressure was spectacular. Casino was good quiet but not too quiet. Staff was very polite. Valet was helpful at both check in and check out.
50,Great stay. The rooms were great and the staff was amazing. Had no issues during our stay. I had a little issue at the self check in and had to get someone to help but overall it was great. The casino area isn’t as big as other hotels in the area but it didn’t stop us from losing money. =)
20,We paid 220 $ the night. The hotel is not worth the money. If you get it for 60$ it is fine. The rooms are tiny the ceilings extremely low (you can touch them easily). There is no service - everything is done by machines. We arrived at 4:30 PM and our room was still not ready. We saw many beautiful hotels in Las Vegas try another one.
30,Yes I know people stay in Vegas with the expectations of casinos etc but the hotels have different target audiences. The Park seems to target smoking gamblers. The rooms have been recently refurbished and have been done well. However how long will it take before hotels learn that guests bring suitcases on wheels and these struggle in thick carpets!!  The new Eataly area was nicely laid out although there was nowhere for breakfast and getting coffee/hot drinks can be a struggle. No fridge in rooms although one available at $25 per day. When needed for medication this is a bit steep. Staff helpful and self check-in process worked well. Having to transit the smokey casino to get in/out did give us coughs and watery eyes but overall not a bad place to stay.
50,The Hotel was literally all I needed. On the Casino area you could find everything you can imagine restaurants (amazing Italian dishes)clubshuge conference rooms. The stuff was really helpful and when I lost my purse the security team found it within 15 minutes. The room was clean and quiet with amazing view to the pools.The Hotel has also great location at the Strip.
30,The hotel amenities were very nice. Restaurants were fab. Primrose is amazing! Get the French Toast! Rooms were very basic no fridge 2 tiny drawers identify crisis of room decor. Check your comforter. Ours was gross and dingy dirty looking but we noticed as we were leaving too late to get something clean. Overall the hotel is nice but the rooms could be improved.
50,We had an enjoyable stay at the hotel for our Janet Jackson weekend. The Park Theater is also a great venue for concerts. Every seat is a good one. We had never stayed on that side of the strip and we loved it. Check in was a breeze. There are many kiosks and hotel staff to assist with check in. Check out was easily done from the TV. The room was clean and looked great. We will definitely be staying here again!
40,Great place to stay great views affordable and a great location. I did get billed twice (once by expedia and once by the hotel) but I think that's because one guest was being obnoxious in the lobby when I was checking in and stressed the attendant out quite a bit. So no hard feelings overall. Would definietly reccommend to a friend.
50,Absolutely beautiful property and amazing staff! Check-in and out process very simple and quick. Never a line! Room was very clean and odor free. Main entrance area although busy but never bottlenecked. Very accommodating for our fur baby as well.
30,The room was nice bed is low but it actually was the best night sleep I've had in awhile. The showers was great.  Thought the casino was a little small compared to other hotels. The resorts fees are a little high.
10,It was advertised as the newest hotel on the strip but it is an old one that's been tarted up poorly. The walls are thin so you can hear people in the next room talking. There's no check in desk so you have to use a kiosk screen to check in. Even with a 3pm check in the room wasn't ready in time. I've not been to Vegas for a long time so perhaps this is typical but I expected some luxury for the price. There was none.
30,Convenient location and parking and rooms are clean. Room was very noisy during the day and was not made up until 6pm. Self checkout is better than the previous interminable lines but does not work seamlessly. Casino and Eataly area are very nice.
20,Nothing bad to say about the hotel but nothing good either. Room service menu is limited slow and the product was poor. Free drinks while playing are regulated by hawkeye bartenders looking at your tier points before the give you another bottle water. If you do have to buy a beer be ready to fork over $11 for a draft. Overall it is a very expensive middle of the road casino with no real identity. Maybe they think the location is a draw. Luckily you can get to Aria Bellagio and New York New York very easily which is where I spent most of my time during this stay.
50,"Usually stay at MGM GRAND. This time we went to PARK MGM for the first time. And we had a blast. Good service overall . Everywhere we went staffs were kind. Mlife desk front desk tables and even ""EATALY"" they were all kind and friendly. I would definitely go back soon and bring more friends with us."
40,Came for the Janet Jackson concert. It was a very pleasant experience. Everyone was very nice an helpful at the event.  We come to Las Vegas once a year and the casino was just perfect for my husband and he did the majority of his gambling at the Park MGM- Room was nice and clean.
20,Since the remodel and change from Monte Carlo to Park MGM the pool area is BLEH boring since removal of lazy river. Rooms are nice but walls are paper thin you can hear talking in the next room. Very clean place though!
40,Updated Hotel very clean great locations a few cons: small pool area not much storage space in the rooms no bathtubs not much counter space. The location is great I love attending concerts at the Park Theatre it is right next to Tmobile. They have Eataly which is a bit overwhelming but people do seem to like it. I have stayed here several times.
20,Not impressed  the room was dirty  bathroom had stuff on toilet rim the Staff was rude  took forever get cocktails playing slots even though gamble a nice amount  even slow tables bed was hard room was above pool had pool parties going on could not sleep  only stayed here cause got a good rate never again rather spend more else where  save your money and go some where else people
50,Had a wonderful time and will make plans to return soon. The gambling was fun. Enjoyed the pool and all the amenities. I enjoyed the nightlife and the rooms were wonderful. Planning our next trip very soon.
50,The renovation of the hotel is clean and fresh. It is perfectly nestled in the middle of everything. It is easy to access and the check in and check out on your phone is super convenient. The restaurant Primrose in the hotel is a real find. And the food plaza Eataly is innovative and tasty. Elevators to your room are easy to access and were never overcrowded. I will return again soon!
50,The remodel is almost completed & it is really an upgrade. Lots of new restaurants & a great Steakhouse. I love the Tram as I also charge food & make bets at Bellagio & Aria. The new Eataly is open & huge & interesting to walk around inside.
30,Rooms are outdated. Housekeeping sub standard even with stay well rooms. Casino has limited table games. No 24 hrs cafe and lounge closed at 2am.  Only one good thing is they have Eataly and nomad Restaurant and bar.
50,Rebranding and reno of what once was the Monte Carlo is a huge improvement. This hotel used to be kinda bland. Since re-branding it’s become a gorgeous resort with lots to offer. Great prices friendly staff super-fast check-in/out perfect location gorgeous room and super comfy bed.
20,This hotels pictures show a different image than what you actually get.  Pros:  Eataly- so amazing and worth every bite  Beautiful new lobby  Cons:  No room service that I saw or was made aware of  Poor room design  No glasses in room (even paper or plastic)  Lack of amenities  TV had horrible reception and constantly froze
40,Excellent casino & hotel. The food is very costly $20.00 min. to eat any thing with a beverage. No buffet very costly to eat at the Park. The pools and the waitress staff is fantastic never had to wait for a cocktail.
50,I had a quiet relaxing vacation with not a care in the world it was wonderful I hope to travel there again I definitely enjoyed my trip it was wonderful the people wonderful the staff was great and love on the specs
40,The renovation was done nicely and I like that the casino is on the smaller side with $10 tables all the time. Eataly is great! My main complaint was the room. It didn’t have a dresser. It had a large couch that was in front on the window and a table and chair in front of the couch that took up too much space and cramped the room. We stayed three nights and I just had to leave my suitcase on the floor opened. I was happy that I had packed in packing cubes but a dresser was needed! I will stay there again but it wasn’t my favorite property in Vegas. It would be a great place to stay if you were in town for a hockey game!
10,The AC in our room hardly worked. The windows were also really dirty. The room was not ready at check-in and the staff in the checkin lobby were also not friendly at all. I will not recommend this place to anyone and will not be coming back.
20,Don’t be fooled. If the resort is busy your room will not be ready even close to when it is supposed to be.    The resort location is good. The resort was also clean. The waiting was insane. They did not have any rooms ready at 10:30 at night.
30,Room was great and the hotel was great. Staff was friendly and food was delicious. The noise from the pool parties was out of control and over the top. I would not recommend to anyone that does not enjoy these types of events or noise. It felt like the music was in our room
20,The check in process has been automated and we felt as though we had become employees as we had to do the check in ourselves. There was not the usual meet and greet welcome that we have always had at the places we have stayed in the past. for the price we would have expected more personal care.  The rooms had NO amenities. There is no coffee maker no fridge no dresser for clothes! and the closet was so small that there was only room for my husbands tux ( we were there for a friends wedding) and a couple shirts. I could not hang my clothes I had a long dresses that I had to hang on the wall on a hook as the closet was so short it would bunch up on the bottom and wrinkle. The suitcases had to sit on the couch as there were no suitcase stands to place then on making it messy and difficult to find non wrinkled clothing. Because the suitcases were on the couch we had limited sitting in the room. The table had no chairs so to allow you to sit at it to have a snack or drink.  The cost of food and drinks in the hotel is very high!! we had to wait for our room and we went to the Primrose bar and had 2 double drinks each and the bill was $63 so with tip it was over $70 which I feel is insulting. We realize that Vegas has become very expensive but that felt over the top.  We had a lovely encounter with security officer Donnovin who was very gracious funny and welcoming. We recommend the Eatily for amazing Italian food it is worth the $$$$ for the pasta and they have a deli type place where you can get a more reasonably priced snack than the $17 starting price meals ( but they are awesome too) We know that this place has been renovated and it is sad that they really did not take the guest comfort into consideration when doing so.
40,I have stayed at the Monte Carlo numerous times and now at the Park 3x. It is any easy property to get free rooms through Mlife for and the casino is less pretentious than other properties. The rooms are small but comfortable. Good location.
50,Park MGM is a hidden gem. Great service nice rooms good casino. Quiet well maintained pool. Just a good stay all around. No issues there. I have stayed at Park MGM a couple of times now and have enjoyed it each time.
30,This hotel showed a lot of promise great location and well presented.    However Park MGM failed the bare minimum standard which should be expected from any hotel/guest house/accommodation that the guests rooms should be available when they check in. After 9 hour flight arriving an hour after check in opened I was told by a computer that my room wasn't ready and the female on the VIP desk I spoke to said I would need to come back in an hour and that they didn't guarantee you could check into the hotel. When I returned room was still not ready though at least this time though I was found another room. I am aware that I was not the only customer who had this problem which only makes it worse.    Whilst room was clean and fairly well presented as were communal area's and I did like the free tram to the Bellagio. It feels unfair to have to pay resort fees for extra's when this hotel can't even do the basics. Think they need to concentrate of providing clean rooms for paying guests when they When I checked out the computers were down but it was 6am so can let this slide.
10,Day 1. Gave us an occupied room  Day 2. Gave us new shampoo conditioner towels etc but didn't even bother making our bed  Day 3. Didn't clean our room I asked the house keeper and she gave me a big sigh. We came back and the room wasn't clean. Spoke to a manager and he told me that it's not customary for rooms to be cleaned daily unless requested. He also told me he came from the Bellagio and that was the case for that hotel as well. I have never stayed at a hotel with such a rule. I could stay at the Holiday inn and they would clean my room and make my bed.
10,"First let it me known that MGM does not run any of their hotels well but this is probably the worst. I booked through Hyatt as a Globalist. If you are with Hyatt and as I have posted before do NOT expect any recognition or Hyatt benefits other than room nights. Despite my previous posts and comments to MGM and Hyatt neither party seems to want to work out the problems. Chances are when you arrive your Hyatt number will not even be on the reservation.    As with all MGM properties expect a high resort fee with little benefit and over-priced restaurants. Last week at the MGM a simple dinner for one person at one of the cheaper restaurants and with NO alcohol cost $75. One of the reasons I booked the Park MGM was the advertisement of a 24 hr fitness center. I don't know if they really have that since I ended up being walked.    Now to my checking on 5/20. I arrived at the hotel a little before 11 PM. I was advised that my room was not ready and that I would need to wait ""no more than an hour."" There were at least 30 other parties and probably closer to 50 that were being told the same thing. To get you out of the lobby they were offering you $10 food/beverage tickets.    I requested a manager and waited 30 minutes to talk to a manager. The only thing that went right was that he was prepared to move me to another MGM property. The poor people who waited hours for rooms and did not speak up for themselves. It took me over an hour from when I first arrived at the Park MGM until I was finally checked in at the alternate property (Mirage).    When I am walked from a Marriott property (where I also have elite status) they pay for one night they pay for transportation to the other property and I am given a significant cash payment for my inconvenience. Don't expect that from MGM or in this case the Hyatt even for a Globalist.    My recommendation to anyone planning to go to Las Vegas is to avoid any MGM property (becoming harder to do) don't expect any Hyatt benefits if you do and expect the cost to be much higher than what you see on the Hyatt site due to the resort fees and eat outside of the hotel. You will pay half as much for better food. Especially avoid the Park MGM unless you want some free food at midnight while they try to find you a room."
50,When searching for a place to stay in Vegas the main thing my husband and I look for are clean rooms proximity to the strip so we can walk around and options for a pool that is somewhat chill. We’ve stayed at quite a few strip hotels over the years and Park MGM quickly became our favorite. The room was great! Simply furnished clean and we loved the little sofa by the window. We had a view of the pools and had a blast checking out everything we could see from our room. We loved the bathroom layout and had no problems getting ready every day.  The check in was easy using the tablets in the lobby. Everyone we encountered from the concierge desk to the VIP desk were super helpful and friendly. This is one place we most definitely will return to.
10,I’ve been going to Las Vegas for the last 42 years and the last 37 years with my wife every year and sometimes twice a year (and with friends usually)… there was 6 of us (3 couples including my son and his wife and our friends from Ohio)… here are a few reasons why I wouldn’t recommend staying at the Park MGM (old Monte Carlo):    • Check In – there is only 1 person to help in that whole area… when you have a bus load of people (figure of speech) arriving at the same time it’s difficult and time-consuming waiting for help especially after a long flight  • Check Out – can’t pay cash for my bill… not everyone pays by credit card just saying… I’m Canadian so the exchange I have to pay on my credit card (USD vs CDN) when I already have USD funds on hand… again there is no one available (I never had this issue at Mirage MGM etc.)  • I requested a King bed but got a room with 2 queens… I called down and they said they would check for me but never got back to me… we stayed here from Sat. to Sat.  • There are no dressers in the room to place your clothes in… how can you have a room with no dressers?... we had to live out of our suitcases… when I go on vacation I like to think I would have a dresser to leave my close in just like at home  • Bathroom – there are no shelving or drawers to place your ‘stuff’ in  • I can’t imagine how cleaning staff has to work in these conditions daily maneuvering around things in a room to clean when you’re basically have to vacuum around suitcases and clean around the sink counter  • One morning I went to ask the person at the kiosk (where you check in) for help to find where the car rental is… she was by herself on her ipad a way from the one couple that was there and said to me ‘wait’… I waited for about 5 minutes then proceeded to look for it myself… again 1 person to help out in that area  • Restaurants – you have Eataly but nothing opens up until after 8am… we’re early birds so we have to leave the premises to get breakfast… Vegas used to be 24/7 but now it seems like office hours  • Customer service is deteriorating much faster at Park MGM compared to other hotels on the strip
10,"Upon arrival we all had to check-in using a kiosk machine. About 100 people arrived at the time we did so we had to maneuver around with our luggage to find a free machine. And of course the machine we finally got to would not work. I could see multiple people checking in looking for an attendant. I never saw one. We finally made it to a machine that worked. Nothing felt less luxury than self check-in. Sort of like the self check at the grocery store...I avoid at all cost!  Then we got to the room. It was a clean room but minimal. No bathroom amenities such as q-tips or cotton balls that I was used to at other Las Vegas properties. The hairdryer must have been from 1982 it barely operated. No mini-fridge so forget about chilling a bottle of wine or taking leftovers back to the room. And no in room coffee maker. You get to stand in line for 30 minutes at the Starbucks down stairs.  My co-workers TV and room phone did not work and had to wait for someone to come up and fix it.  This was definitely a ""discount stay"" and I would not recommend it if you are to go for vacation. Its fine for business."
40,We tried the hotel again after last visit to look at updates etc. Location right on the middle of the strip and rooms were priced right. Asked for top floor room with view and our room was on the 28th floor facing T-Mobil Arena and interstate. corridors are dark and gloomy. You can hear people in the next room while laying in bed. The room was clean but the decor was odd with pictures that did not match. The drawers were too small to fit clothes and only had three hangers (we begged for more). Hotel was remodeled since our last stay there but we expected the room to be larger. Barn door between closet and bathroom was different and you had to be sure which was open and closed before entering during the night. New front end eateries were nice; however expensive. Staff was excellent and very friendly.
50,I decided to surprise my wife with a birthday trip to Las Vegas. On a recommendation we booked at Park MGM. After which I read the reviews on Yelp and Trip Advisor and they had a few reviews that gave them a bad rap. I would that Park MGM was the best resort experience I have had in the 20 years of coming to Las Vegas. The concierge service from Kelly Fisher was so over the top I could not believe it. She had everything set up like we planned the weekend to be. Having multiple gift baskets arrive at different times for my wife and little surprises. Thank Kelly! The MLife staff were also great showing us how to us the program to get the best out of it. Gold status in 36 hours! The room was awesome. We stayed in a Stay Well room and there are not many reviews on the them. Trust me they are worth the few extra dollars. The room lighting is cool! We dined at Bavette's had lunch at the marketplace and had a blast. Thank you Park MGM see you again shortly!
30,Our room was on the 19th floor and corridors are dark and gloomy. The shower head pressure was strong and no control over it. The room decor was odd with pictures that did not match. The drawers were too small fit clothes. MGM had remodeled the hotel and we expected the room and casino to have a fresher look. You can hear people in the next room by window wall. Unlikely to stay again.
40,Room smelled like smoke but I took it with a grain of salt because it is Vegas after-all and you're barely in your room as it is. The casino as a whole was nice the dining was okay but there are plenty of more options across the street at the New York New York.
50,We had a BLAST!!! 4 of us girls went on a girl trip to Vegas. Prime location....rooms were near and tidy. Beautiful pools. Staff very friendly and helpful. Right across the Vegas Arena. Beds were comfy and rooms were very roomy.
30,"We've stayed here before but this trip was less than ideal for us. Had a very late arrival and was awoken at 11am to which I can only describe as a vibration test of the walls and windows. See apparently on Fri/Sat/Sun there is a little pool party for the ""Nomad"" pool and the music and vibrations from the music physically could be felt. Less than ideal for a relaxing getaway if you ask us. Anyways about 3pm when we were about to head out for awhile we stopped by the VIP desk and inquired how long the room would be vibrating for and they said it's 11am-6pm. We inquired about a room switch even though fully unpacked at this point and the said the T-Mobile side gets rowdy and loud and the Vegas strip side they have a club and that shakes through the night. At this point I should have just gone with the T-Mobile side as I'm sure it would have been less noise. Anyways on Saturday we were shocked to hear the music stop at about 5:20 and we very happy for the earlier room vibrations to end only to have it start back up about 20 mins later due to a private dinner event poolside. Not happy with the situation I messaged on twitter and they we're happy to comp me resort fee for 1 night. At this point I was regretting having not moved rooms but thought we would just suck it up.    The lighting was nice in the room as a lot of Vegas rooms are not well lit. If you have little ones who like /need to take baths this isn't the place for you or at least our room type wasn't as it was shower only. The Valet team was incredible as since they've implemented sky rocketing valet / self parking fees I feel the service has suffered. So to have an attentive interactive quick valet team was a plus for this trip. ( We visit vegas about 6-8 times a year)    Eataly was a nice little place to walk through but really wasn't our cup of tea. Except we did try the gelato and it was delish.    Best of luck to you and yours when you go down and if especially on a weekend during Spring/Summer time and you have a view of the Nomad pool...You have been warned. =)    And don't forget about the ""resort"" fee's... I think they're about $42 a night after taxes now? Ugh. =("
20,I want to be checked in by a real human being. Not work some tablet screen to check myself in. I had questions on how to get to a few things in the area. Touch screens don't answer questions - real people behind the counter do.    Also I had a reservation and was checking in at 10:00 pm on a Tuesday. Why am I being told that my room isn't ready? How can my room NOT be ready at 10:00 pm on a Tuesday night? This is a first for me in all my years of travel.    All my co-workers got rooms with nice views. I get the room of a scenic view of the air conditioning unit.    I've had better service from other hotels on the vegas strip dung past stays. I'll be avoiding this hotel like the plague.
50,A good location and not a huge distance to the strip. Great amenities and friendly staff. Did some gambling (slot machines) and they have a great selection of machines. Next time I’ll play some other games and hopefully stay more than 1 night.
50,The place was clean and welcoming I would definitely stay again. The food down at the eataly was delicious but a bit on the expensive side of things. Beds are comfortable and the rooms were very quiet.
40,Found myself staying on the South side of the Strip last couple visits so Decided to Give Park MGM a shot since its a fairly new (remodeled yes I know). They did an awesome Job with Eataly and the casino is Nice and easy to Navigate in and out if your not Gambling. Location is great In my personal opinion because I love the food restaurants in NYNY and its next door. Room was simple and Basic but nice bathroom was nice everything worked and was clean. Only minor things O noticed was no mini fridge AC seemed to be working hard and not cooling off (had to set it to 58° to get room to 65°) and lastly the outside window was filthy dirty. Our room was on the 17th Floor at the end of the hall so I didnt have an issue with noise from neighbors as other people complained because I had none lol. Also it was pool side so You do hear the music from the Nomad pool No complaints from me there though It was my wake up engery music before hitting Vegas.    Overall I would recommend this Hotel to anyone who is interested.
50,Awesome Newly Refurbised hotel that has an awesome food selection from Italy along with a great steakhouse and other great options. The rooms were comfortable and the beds were a sleep haven. I will be back again and again.
10,Need to improvement for customer service. Our company is using this hotel for 25 years for conference. Specially provide permission early check in. Because people are coming from different states.  At dinner meeting. some items were missing. We had trouble so many things.
40,Great location on the strip. Right next to T-Mobile Park and MGM theaters.  Newly remodeled mid-priced for the strip. We’ve stayed here many times during renovations and they are almost done. Just some new restaurant work in front going on and adding a pedestrian crosswalk over the strip right out front.  Deliberately not the usual glitzy vegas vibe. Tastes vary but we have stayed here many times in the last few years with only minor complaints that are usually handled quickly.
20,We received 4 complimentary nights at the Park MGM and since it was newly renovated thought we would give it a try. The room and services were bare bones amenities. You had to check in and out though a Kiosk; there is no registration desk but a VIP desk if you are the Gold level for M Life - the first impression when we arrived is that we were not important enough to the hotel to have that personal touch. I would not stay at the park MGM again even if it was complimentary.
40,enjoyed my stay at the Park MGM the only issue was on a Monday and 2/3 of the pool was reserved for a private party. would stay again.The rooms have all been updated to a modern vibe.Eataly at the front of the hotel was interesting but a bit pricey.
50,Must stay resort. Very good service all the way around. Park MGM has done some great things and we enjoy our stays here. We will continue to stay here. Juniper bar is a must for anyone who enjoys a good drink. Ask for Tim.
20,Their self check in system didn’t work for us. We arrived early and checked in early. Their self check in system was suppose to send us an email once our room is ready. Waited for hours but never got the email. Didn’t get any apologies about the delay. I was told by one of the check in staff to not expect our room to be ready by 3pm even though their checkin time starts at 3pm! Terrible service and attitude! Staff was also unfriendly at bell desk. I approached them to check in a bag and they didn’t greet me or say one word. Just pointed a finger at another staff.
50,This was the best experience I have had in all of my stays at Vegas! The ambiance was outstanding everything was local and close to the strip. All team members of the Park MGM were extremely helpful and attentive and the bar was central to all slots on the floor.
50,The staff responded to each of our requests. As a consequence ww thoroughly enjoyed our stay. John at the concierge desk made our special arrangements. The Eataly was so impresssive and we now have a new friend Carlota who educated us about that facility.
40,Good: Good location nice facilities easy to get strip.  Need: Small room no refrigerator no water no tissue in the room slow response from the bell desk. I waited to get a shampoo for 30mins in my room.
40,We stayed at the Park for ten days. We loved the hotel slight issue with checking in but quickly resolved one room we were assigned hadn’t been cleaned but a quick phone call and we were given two new rooms very promptly by a very friendly and efficient lady on reception.  We loved the layout of the hotel very easy to navigate and not huge like most. We liked the atmosphere all the staff we had contact with were friendly and approachable.  The room was fine lovely and clean beds comfy but as previously said no storage living out of your case for ten days isn’t great.  The pools are great loads of loungers.....just the music so so loud everywhere! Surely there could be a small area for chilling by the pool with a book?  Casino good variety of slots and tables great bar in the middle.  Loved Juniper and Primrose. We also went in the Sports bar too and had a great meal and cocktails.  All round a lovely hotel and looking forward to going back as soon as we can.
50,Everything is new about the Park MGM...food service and name. Had the most fun and great food every on our 26th trip to this city. We will stay at the Park next trip with no hesitation...Casino was $$ and such a great experience.
40,Stayed 4 nights at a strip view room good size and nice decor except the bed is too soft and the wall is too thin could practically hear next door's conversation all night long which affect the quality of sleep in addition there was a gap between the shower door and the fixed pannel water leak out to the floor while you shower. all staff are very friendly and helpful
30,The pool area has massive speakers aimed directly up a the hotel the vibrate windows up to at least the 24 floor. (my room) This is a daily occurrence and hotel staff said it was a common complaint with nowhere in the hotel they could place that would be quieter. So no afternoon naps before going out and no quiet evenings in the room with your partner until after the pool party is done. It is Vegas but I still to be able to rest in my room when I want to.
40,The eataly could have been filled with all sorts of different selections. Mexican burgers thai New York New York is the place to go for food. Along with room service selection it could have been better.
30,Automatic Check in system was poorly organized and there were not enough stuff members to assist during the check in. If the guests had long flight they expect to have excellent check in experience so they can enjoy their stay.
30,"Rooms are nice but everything in the hotel is super expensive such as food and drink. Walls between rooms are thin and I heard my neighbors frequently. Also I could hear the noise from the leaf blowers on the street even though I was high up on the 16th floor. Room amenities are few there isn't even a refrigerator in the room. Common areas are overly air conditioned except for the fitness center which is too warm. I didn't see the value from the ""resort fee"". Mobile checkout was a nice feature but the kiosk check-in was buggy my colleagues and I didn't receive the text messages for our keys that we should have. Overall I don't think this property merits the price paid."
40,The rooms are very basic and bland. But clean and comfortable. I was so underimpressed I didn't even take photos like I typically do. Stayed here because I was excited about Eataly. Also under-impressive and wasn't all that good.
20,I was excited to stay at the park Mgm . I’ve stayed at all Mgm places and looked forward to staying at the remodeled and name changed Monte Carlo . I know that you room isn’t done until after 3pm it’s that way with all of them. I have the mgm app that said check in and will let you know when room is ready. Around 1pm the app said I need to see the front desk (picture provided) so I left the Golden nugget (which I paid extra to stay until the park room was ready) I was ready to see the changes. Well I got to the front desk” the important thing” they wanted was to see my ID. So I showed them and was ready to check in. They said my room wasn’t ready. I asked why did the app message me a change has happened when I could have showed my ID at check in time. I was then told no queen rooms were ready in my offer but I could get another room now for $30. I didn’t want to wait two hours so I said great that’s fine for $30 dollars. He confirmed $30. What that meant later upon check out was $30 dollars a day. For a lack luster strip view. So they got me for $60 more dollars and I wanted to ask about it at self check out but no one came. I pressed the assistance button and waited for about 5 minutes making it a total of 10 minutes of needing help and asking questions. Beautiful place but wait until 3 pm no matter what the app says and good luck on finding a humans help.
20,After traveling all day got to hotel check in was pretty easy - had a few problems so a staff member helped and assigned me my room. When I got to my room there was a trash can sitting in the middle of the room (full) thought it was a little odd but as I started to look around the beds weren't made bathroom was a mess it clearly had not been prepared my visit. Called staff and they offered me to stay in room with a meal credit or change rooms with a smaller credit. I wanted to move and just felt like there could of been more done to make me feel comfortable.
40,Overall great stay and a conveniently located resort. Only had a slight issue with some linen from housekeeping left behind when we entered the room. The only other slight issue was there was a little difficulty checking in as the reader was not recognizing the my driver's license and there was no one there to help. Granted this was around 12:00am. I would stay at this resort again.
30,We visit Vegas annually for a little reprieve from the lingering chill of winter and to welcome summer. This year I decided to try out the Park MGM since it was recently renovated. I would say overall it is meh.    My first impression was at the Bell Desk where three men were conjoining at the corner and never bothered to ask if they could assist us in any way. Instead we waiting in line to talk to the one lady behind the desk after which we were pointed to see one of the men at the corner. Bummer!    Check-in is like the self service lines at the grocery store. Convenient yet a little confusing. Didn’t speak to any live person and being our first time at the hotel we had no information on amenities.    Upon entering the room first impression was MEH! We were on the 5th floor with a view literally of a wall and the HVAC system. My reservation indicated a strip view. But I am not one to hassle with such indiscretions and simple sucked it up. The room is clean enough but there is no place to put luggage except on the floor or on the couch. Even in the room there is no information about amenities or restaurants hours etc. There simply was a room service menu. The blackout shade is nice. Noise level for being halfway down the hall was good could only hear the neighboring room. Luckily the hotel is on a smaller scale and easy to navigate.    The bed was firm comfortable enough for me. Nothing to write home about.    Eataly was overwhelming! I’ll write a separate review of the restaurant we ate at.    Pool area is nice simple and relaxing. I really enjoyed the lounge chairs in the pool. Be prepared to have your room key upon entering and to have your bag checked by a big bouncer-like dude that makes you feel as though you have already done something wrong.    The pool was not overcrowded and we easily got chairs with a shade right next to the south pool. The more comfortable chairs at the north pool all had reserved signs both days and all day. I am one to reserve a chair or day bed when the pool area is too crowded but there was no need while were there. I’ve been to pools where people are lined up like it’s Disneyland at 7 in the morning so this was certainly a nice change of pace. There are some hotels I won’t return to because the pool area was so maddening.    Poolside service was hit and miss. The first day it was typical where you will see your waitress occasionally and have to be patient between ordering and when she comes back again.    Second day at the pool we had a late start but still wanted coffee. There is a cafe adjacent to the pool area that has great coffee and you can order to go. The security guard at the pool area said the ONLY outside food or drink allowed is from Starbucks. You can not bring anything in from Primrose the adjoining cafe. WTF?!? I despise Starbucks coffee. So we were going to order from the poolside waitress but after waiting 15 minutes my daughter ran to Starbucks. By the time she returned still no waitress. I saw her meandering around on the walkways but never had her come by the entire time we were at the pool. There were maybe a dozen people out that day so again it wasn’t like they were overwhelmed.    Check out was a breeze and requesting a late check out on the tv was simple - for a fee. Although apparently our late check out wasn’t communicated with the maid service. She knocked once and entered the room even though the DND sign was on the door. I get that the DND sometimes is left too long and the cleaners must ignore it when one is suppose to be checked out of a room. But since we had paid to stay until afternoon I was surprised and concerned that they would enter the room. What if we had not been in there?!!
50,Love coming to visit and Park MGM has a very comfortable and inviting vibe...i love staying here..the location is close to new york which has more night life but i like the fact that Park MGM is smaller and more quaint...great sports bar and the rooms are very nice and beds very comfortable.
50,Great Hotel in a fantastic location they have everything need walking distance the rooms are simple and nice. The food is excellent we enjoyed Eataly which is about 1-2 mins from the lobby. They have every sort of Italian food you can imagine.
20,Underwhelmed from automated check in to no dressers in the room to bait & switch night club salespeople/employees. Was expecting much more from an MGM property. Never felt like a ‘customer’. La La Noodle was great though!
40,Great place convenient location good service good gaming. Wish rooms had coffee pot microwave and fridge. Came as a group of 5 2 rooms. Staff was attentive with requesting fridge for medicinal reasons as well as a shower chair.
40,This is definitely an upgrade from the Monte Carlo. Eataly alone is worth staying here not to mention amazing cocktails and great food at Best Friend. It's pretty centrally located and has access to other hotels via the tram.
30,POSITIVES:  Room Well kept good linens good housekeeping  Pools - 3 good size with trees and plenty    NEGATIVES::  Small Closet approx width 4 feet 7 hangers. worked for me a single but 2 or more may be a squeeze.    Wall safe: small verticle mounted 4 deep 11 wide11 height.    Complex - casino hotel pools - contstant music - not background but rather foreground. Hard to find a quite space even in park or pool area.    Front desk - non existant making getting answers for typical questions a questions a quest. I went to conceirge or VIP only to be told not our dept speak with xyz or no we don't know so go away. My impression - de facto no front desk or help available in lobby. Once checked in you are on your own .    BE AWARE: On Thurs Fri and Sat there is a nomad pool side party starting around 1 pm til .... Avoid rooms that front that pool. In my room 22-106 on the top floor on the south wing away from the nomad pool the thumping was noticiable.    SIP AND DINE ADVICE:  BEFORE YOU GO print off a list of the MGM resturants and bars that your credits can be used at.    This is important for two reasons.  First the credits can only be used at SELECT resturants.  Second: No MGM staff on property was/will be able to provide you a list. I asked at VIP and Concirege and you would have thought I was speaking Latin.    ACCOUNTING:  A) MGM room's account display never shows credit. This serves to confuse. I was not really sure I was getting the credit as the word credit never showed on my account.  B) you MUST use/spend your FIRST day's credit before MIDNIGHT on the DAY you CHECK IN. BE SURE TO DO THAT. Otherwise you forfet that day credit.  C) you MUST use/spend your LAST day's credit by midnight the of the day BEFORE the day you are to CHECK OUT Otherwise you forfeit that days credit.  D) If you charge something to your room and IT IS ELIGIABLE eligable for your sip/dine credit IT WILL SIMPLY NOT APPEAR ON YOUR rooms account.    E) IF you charge something in a resturant or bar that is NOT IN THE PROGRAM it will immediately show on your rooms account. Took me a couple days to figure this out.    KEY TAKE AWAY    FOR SIP AND DINE- : ALWAYS PRINT OFF RESTURANTS/BARS IN PROGRAM BEFORE!! YOU GO.
50,Our stay at Park MGM was very pleasant. Quiet and restful but with central Las Vegas easily accessible. Everything was of course within walking distance and totally safe. There were lots of attractions to enjoy
10,Automatic check in procedure caused me to be separated from my party of 5. I had to change floors & room on day 2 in order to get back with my original party reservation from 5 months ago.  Guest rooms have no storage for your clothing maybe your underwear and my 2nd room on this trip had a horrible sewage/sulfur smell in the room. They offered us the opportunity to change rooms AGAiN but we just stayed in the 2 other rooms we were originally reserved with for the majority of the time. This smell did not fade away in the 3 nights we were in the room. I won't stay here again on my next trip to Vegas.
50,It was my first time at this hotel absolutely loved the location where it is on the strip it’s close to everything and it sabe you a lot of unnecessary walk. They have a nice Italian market that everyone should try also the pools are great and the rooms are sophisticated. For sure I am returning there next year.
50,Simplicity is the word. Very nice and clean remodeled room. Check in took two minutescheck out took one minute housekeeping excellent staff very professional Lalla noodles really good Eataly even better. Gaming descent. We'll be coming back to Park MGM for sure....
50,This trip for us was to get married. We had a great time and when I booked the rooms directly thru Park MGM I was impressed with how helpful and friendly everyone was. When I explained what the trip was for and how I envisioned things the concierge was extremely helpful by suggesting the perfect chapel etc. it was wonderful to speak with staff that seemed so genuine and friendly.
20,Overall the hotel is fine with clean rooms and good restaurant options. Nothing bad but also nothing particularly impressive. This review is primarily based because of the location.    If you have a car and would naturally use the self-park garage stay away! You will regret it. Whereas the location of the hotel on the Strip is great if you're going to be walking everywhere but if you're driving it will be a nightmare.    Because it's adjacent to T-Mobile if there is an event traffic control will close many of the streets surrounding the hotel when the event gets out. I was returning from a concert at The Palms and was at the back of the hotel on Frank Sinatra Blvd. The garage is literally right there and all I had to do was make a LEFT turn which I had done plenty of other times. Because of the event they didn't allow left turns. I tried going further to enter from behind NY NY to the garage. No luck they closed that road too. The only option was to access the street from Las Vegas Blvd drive past the hotel and T-Mobile to make a RIGHT turn to the garage. To do this I had to drive all the way around go over the 215 freeway overpass to come down on Tropicana to access Las Vegas Blvd in the direction I needed to go. And Las Vegas Blvd was a bottleneck. Because of all the road closures what would have been 5 minutes if I had been able to make a Left on Frank Sinatra Blvd turned into a 1 hour and 15 min delay. Not one bit of exaggeration it took me over an hour.
40,In town for 5 night getaway..12 floor room looking at strip..could hear jest taking off which made resting difficult. Pool area was great much improved over the Monte Carlo. Gaming floor not really redone just new rugs lighting...the eatery in the front of the complex was excellent
40,The transformation to Park MGM has brought some new life Eataly was fun and lively great addition. Be aware the standard rooms don't have traditional hotel furniture no dresser or real storage space same in the bathroom. Overall a nice hotel in a good location on the strip. Easy to navigate staff was friendly however I did not care for the automated front desk. Miss the staff and a smiling face when I arrive. Last note the pool areas are nice!
30,This is not a recommended destination. If you are looking for proximity to T-Mobile or the new football stadium try the MGM or Luxor instead. Rooms are average at best lacking ammenites and management staff is lacking cohesiveness and follow up abilities.
40,The facility was nice and clean. The crowd was well behaved. The casino is a little small however there always seem to be gaming available. The guest room I stayed in was a little plane but comfortable. Staff was very friendly and service was quick. Overall the value was right.
40,My friends and I went to Vegas for my birthday and stayed at Park MGM. We liked the location the layout and the food was excellent. The only thing that was weird and annoying is there wasn't a dresser in the room for you to unpack your clothes into. I dislike living out of a suitcase! Other then that the beds where great and the room was clean and tidy. This would be a great if it weren't for the lack of space to put your personal items.
40,First time staying at the Park MGM and it was nice. Check-in wasn't as smooth as I would have liked it to be but it was resolved. Rooms are very clean and service was good. I would definitely stay at a different MGM property for my next stay.
50,The location is excellent. The Park area was amazing with a variety of things to do. The spa was relaxing visually stunning and the staff provided great customer service. I certainly plan to stay at Park MGM again.
40,Rooms nicely updated from the renovation. On the strip with easy access to lots of restaurants and entertainment. The food and service at the steakhouse were both excellent. Large casino with a good selection of slot machines.
40,The resort is in a perfect location. Staff were very helpful. My only complaint is the bathroom in room was not thoroughly clean there was hair in the shower and floor and water in sink. It looked like they did a quick clean up and forgot to dry out the sink making it look like someone had recently washed their hands.
40,I’ve stayed at this hotel twice in the past year. With the recent renovations this hotel is located in a great place on the strip. The rooms are great except don’t get a room on the 8th floor as the nightclub music is very loud and disruptive late into the night. The pools and hot tub are great. Lots of deck chairs. Good poolside and towel service. My only complaint would be that there are very few places to eat in the hotel except for the Eataly food area. I wish they had a decent restaurant to have breakfast in the morning. They also don’t have a buffet restaurant in the hotel. We played roulette and blackjack in the casino ($10 minimum bet on both tables). Both games had several tables to choose from. Although the blackjack tables ranged from $10 to $25 as a minimum bet. They should also provide free parking to hotel guests. Paying $15/day for parking was crazy as was the $37/day resort fee which is just a huge money grab If you ask me.
40,Great location rooms are setup with a nice big desk/table for work! Casino is clean and the renovations were very nice just people need to be more respectful when smoking weed on property! Were going back to Vegas soon so Haven't decide if well stay there again!
30,Staff not friendly at check in or check out. Its a job for them. Did not ask us any questions just said this is your room got credit card number. etc and sent us on the way. Di not even say where the elevators are etc.
30,A regular hotel with very limited room amenities such as no refrigerator coffee maker or even a dresser. Biggest disappointment though was the total destruction of the Monte Carlo pool and lazy river with three very small concrete unimaginative rectangular pools that you would not build in your own backyard.
40,Park MGM is located in a great location on the strip. Love that the tram starts/stops there.  The newly designed pool area is wonderful. The bar has great food and beverages.  The newly renovated rooms could use a bureau or chest of drawers for putting clothing especially if you are staying for a longer time.  A variety of different restaurants would be nice too with a few staying open after 10:00 at night.
30,Comfortable room...no coffee maker or refreshments of any sort in the room. Self check in results in not being fully aware of what the resort offers such as in room dining options any shows or entertainment options etc. Be careful of the bathroom doors as they slide in beyond the hand guard which can cause injury
30,I used to stay at Monte Carlo annually when we did this trip. We waited patiently for Park MGM to open back up just to be let down.    Pros- Bed was comfortable    Cons- No dressers in the room (lived out of suitcase) shower leaked into room no food available after 10PM in lobby or casino no more lazy river
40,The hotel is busy but well run. It's the sign of the times that there is a automated check in service which gets some getting used to. Rooms can be basic as friends of ours have found out compared with the suit we booked.
30,Was in town for work related conference. Stay was at a competing property. Post the conference we chose to stay at ParkMGM based on suggestion that the property was remodeled once acquired by MGM and based on a fair room rate as well.
50,The park MGM is the renovated Monte Carlo hotel located on the strip next to New York New York and adjacent to the TMoble arena. Self parking for $15 per day with in and ot preliverage. Valid is also available. Self check in using kiosks. Upper floors is another upper end hotel called Nomad.
50,We stayed here for two nights while getting married in Vegas and continuing to do route 66.    I thought the check in service was great It was a self service checkin you even print your own key's and if you did need assistance there was always someone there to give you a helping hand No long queues like you would find in most las vegas hotels.    We stayed in a king room and it was lovely very clean and stylish really loved the colour schemes and design.    I found the hotel a in a great location for everything you need.    We even received a complementary bottle when we got back to our room on the wedding day from reception which was a lovely touch I would highly recommend this hotel everything was just perfect.
50,Second time we have stayed at the Park The new Eataly was open and a great addition. Many excellent choices with a fun modern feel. Enjoyed a wonderful cheese and meat board La Pizza and La La Noodle. Also a great Italian Pastry Bar with gelato we enjoyed every night. It’s a must in Vegas. You won’t be disappointed
50,This hotel/casino has come along way. It is fabulous. Staff is always friendly. One comment about the service is that there seems to be a lot less servers on the casino floor. Should employ more especially during peak hours.
50,We stayed at the Park MGM for 5 nights. The rooms were clean with king bed built in window seat chair and table. Bathrooms were very nice - excellent water pressure in clean shower.  Check in was problematic. Issues with auto check in kiosks. Delays with room keys being issued. Not enough staff in the help had to wait a while. Once staff was available they were helpful and pleasant.  Great pool with pool side service that we really enjoyed.
10,My stay was okay I just didn’t like the fact they don’t feel the need to tell you out hidden fees. I had a total of 4 pending charges from this hotel. I even spoke to the property manger after being on the phone for two hours & she was completely rude & not understanding!
30,Rooms were average nothing to write home about. Carpets in the hallways were dirty self check in was weird and not enough staff to help. Music in the pool area was so loud it made my windows vibrate on the ninth floor.
50,We had such a wonderful time at the Park. Check-in was fast and easy they accommodated an early check-in for us. The rooms are modern sleek and comfortable. The amenities are lovely great pool tons of restaurant options. We had a really great time at Best Friend Eataly On the Record and Jemaa! Thanks to Jimmie Hill for helping organize our nightlife too!!
50,The check in was kiosk and the customer service was excellent. Walked us through it. The staff so helpful. Very quick check in and out. The beds were so comfortable. Very convenient location on the strip to our shows.
50,This is my first time staying at the Park MGM since the re branding. We were a little hesitant as the Monte Carlo was very special to my husband and I. We were pleasantly surprised! Check-in was done via Kiosk which I would prefer more of a personalized arrival but it was fast and I had my room keys within minutes. Only downside was the lobby was a little dark and it was hard to see where I needed to scan my I.D.    We got a room on the 3rd floor overlooking the T-Mobile Arena. We stayed during the Boxing Fight and were a little concerned about noise but it was SO QUIET! The only thing was we could hear whenever our neighbor would open his shades...it did wake me up one morning but otherwise very quiet room. The decor was decent. I didn't think it was anything spectacular but I did love the window seat. I spent most of the time there when in my room. Loved the bathroom...shower was very nice.    We had our anniversary breakfast at Primrose which was very good. We arrived early for our 9 AM reservation and they seated us relatively quickly. Each staff member wished us a happy anniversary which was sweet. The food was delicious and our server was pleasant.    Eataly was a neat new addition to the property. I did not like the smell but we tried a pizza from there one night and it was delicious!    We also thoroughly enjoyed the Moneyline Bar. The burgers were out of this world!    My only complaints were the casino floor was pretty small. It was small when the MC but they have decreased it even more. I also did not like the self-check outs. I had an issue with my bill and requested assistance and no one showed up for over 10 minutes. I finally cancelled my check-out and went hunting down a staff member. I was not happy about this but the staff member I found Mica was amazing and made all my frustrations go away. She really is a gem!    Overall I am happy with this property! It's got a great vibe! The remodel was beautiful and rooms are comfortable. Not to mention FANTASTIC location! Would recommend and will stay again!
40,Either they take care of their rooms very well or we were lucky enough to get the last finished room on their renovation. The room smells and looks new. The self check-in and checkout wasn't as bad as some of the reviews. I do see that if your not a techie it might be confusing but overall a good idea. I see MGM rolling this out on all their hotels. On regular check-in counters they'll have sometimes 4 people with long lines. They have over a dozen self check-in counters so it's like having 12 people checking you in. Less long lines although the wait could possibly be the person in front of you who's trying to navigate around the computer. There was little contact with staff so I never experienced the rude staff that some people are talking about. Casino is small and it looks like they are trying to recoup their renovation money as I don't see anyone hitting it big. Overall I would go back again.
40,The hotel location is prime. Check in is virtual which I did not care for. There is no one to assist in room selection or answer questions and the lines would wrap through the lobby. Further there are no coffee makers in the room and the lobby Starbucks was always at least a thirty minute wait.
30,I was disappointed that there wasn't a coffee maker in the room or a refrigerator. My room wasn't ready when I checked in at 10:30 PM and I had to wait until someone came to help me in order to get a room - which was two queen beds instead of the king that I requested. Overall it was just OK.
50,It is not a luxurious hotel but it is excellent price and awesome location first class service and nice restaurant especially La La Noodles. The amenity is very clean and the check in and check out is easy. Bell desk service is great.
50,Terrific location in the center of Strip action! The Bellagio is easily accessed by a monorail and The Aria and Cosmopolitan are next door.    Registration is completed on an iPad. Quirky buggy and the program is not friendly and truly a pain. Perhaps that is why so many employees are needed to get everyone registered into the hotel.    If you are a high roller they have staff at a desk to register you in the hotel. Typical example of rank having privilege.    The rooms have not changed much from the hotels incarnation as the Monte Carlo. We stayed there about 8 years ago same configuration very nice sized room.    Truly enjoyed Eataly. Slices of pizza pasta wine and crepes were tasty.
50,It’s no Bellagio but just as great as Luxor Delano! AND it’s literally right on the strip! The new Eataly food court area is amazing! You can tell a lot of thought went into the construction this hotel. Hand painted floral murals on the casino floor. Amazing experience!! Definitely staying again!!
50,First trip back since it has become the MGM Park hotel. Very nice miss the lazy river pool and some of the old restaurants. Staff wonderful! We loved Betty's rest. at the Sports Bar. Miss the old coffee shop too.
30,I preferred the pools/restaurants and service previously provided when the hotel was Monte Carlo. The overall renovation is underwhelming and disappointing. The only thing that has improved by far are the restaurants and food available.
50,The newly renovated Park MGM formally the Monte Carlo is a beautiful property with bright and modern decor. The rooms looked great and small features and amenities included were great. The staff was friendly and hospitable. And all the food outlets were great. The only thing I would say was that the digital kiosks were a little slow during use. Other than that the Park MGM is a great property with a great location on the strip.
50,I was a little concerned after booking the hotel and reading the reviews after.    I have to say I was really happy with everything about the hotel.    Self check in and out was so quick and easy.    The room I had was on 28th floor and I had the best view of the pools and views of the neighbouring hotels and some views of mountains.    The bed was so comfortable and room cleaned daily.    I know people mentioned the lack of tea/coffee facilities in the room but there is a Starbucks a few steps away from the lifts downstairs.    You are able to get the free tram from the hotel up to the Bellagio.    If you want to use the pool it opens at 8am and there are towels available.    Overall a fantastic hotel and would definitely recommend staying here.
10,Self- check kiosks - what a nightmare. There's no-one to help with reservation questions. You have to check-in then go to VIP Desk for help so you wait in line twice. 2 stops instead if 1. Waste of time. There is a total lack of security at the elevators. Elevator area and guest room hallways are dimly lit increasing the feeling of no security. I didn't feel safe. Only 3 hangers no dresser. Had to call for extra hangers. Room wasn't ready. Most staff did try to help. Got the impression their isn't much they can do.
40,Everything's was very good it was nice staff nice and clean. One nice thing was the smoke was bearable not like the other casinos.  The pools were nice everything was very maintained. The beds were so damn comfortable we almost wanted to sleep 10 hours each night.  The only thing I would say is there's no reason for drinks at any casino to cause $20 per drink. These casinos make plenty of money makes me want to stay in old town or off the Strip.
